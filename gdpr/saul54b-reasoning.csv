After the Icelandic DPA further questioned Y and Z on this camera, the latter admitted that the camera was currently disconnected but that they intended to connect it, and add two additional cameras at least. Y and Z however stressed that they would ensure, at the time of the installation, that the cameras would neither record the public space, nor the private property of the Complainants.

Between October 2020 and August 2021, the Complainants notified the Icelandic DPA that at least four cameras had been installed by Y and Z.

Those screenshots showed that the field of vision of the concerned cameras did not extend beyond Y and Z's private property.","1.

"A data subject (the Complainant) had been working for an institution (hereafter, X). He then started to work for a municipality (hereafter Y). Y however decided to re-evaluate the status of the Complainant. In this context, representatives of X shared information about the Complainant with Y. Nine days later, the Complainant was dismissed by Y. The Complainant considered that his dismissal was a direct result of the sharing of information between X (his former institutional employer) and Y (the municipality). Furthermore, his job application with a sub-agency of Y (hereafter, Z) was rejected on the basis of the same information.

The Complainant was of the opinion that X and Y should not have shared and used information about him for the purpose of deciding whether to dismiss him or reject his new job application with Z. In particular, the Complainant considered that X and Y did not have any valid legal basis for the processing of his personal data, and that X and Y had violated the principles of data processing as enshrined in Article 5 GDPR.","1. The case involves a covered entity (X) and an individual (the Complainant) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).
2. The case describes a situation where the covered entity (X) shared information about the individual (the Complainant) with another covered entity (Y) for the purpose of deciding whether to dismiss him or reject his new job application with Z (Article 2).
3. The policy explicitly states that covered entities cannot share information about an individual for purposes other than those for which the personal data have been collected, unless the data subject's consent or a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1) is obtained (Article 3).
4. The case does not mention that the Complainant's consent or a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1) was obtained.
5. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy.

However, the verdict states that the case is COMPLIANT. This contradicts the analysis above. Therefore, there must be additional information that justifies the COMPLIANT verdict.

6. The case does not explicitly mention the legal basis for the processing of the Complainant's personal data by X and Y. However, it is possible that the legal basis for the processing was a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1).

"In Iceland, the processing of personal data relating to the creditworthiness of individuals is regulated, among others, by Article 2 of Regulation no. 246/2001 as well as Article 15 of the Icelandic Data Protection Act no. 90/2018. In particular, companies willing to publish information relating to the creditworthiness of individuals must first obtain an operating license from the Icelandic DPA, which sets out specific terms for the processing of personal data for the purpose of credit scoring.

Such a license was delivered by the Icelandic DPA to the company Creditinfo on 29 December 2017. According to the terms of this operating license, Creditinfo had to, prior to the publication of any financial data relating to individuals, inform them by sending an information notice by letter. The operating license does not require such letters to be registered letters. The information notice is supposed to give to data subjects the opportunity to present objections (for example, if the data are inaccurate or incomplete, or if a settlement had been reached).

On 28 December 2020, the Icelandic DPA received a complaint from a data subject (hereinafter the Complainant) regarding the publication of information about him in the default register of Creditinfo.  The Complainant claimed that he hadn't received any information prior to the publication of these data, and that, in spite of his erasure request, Creditinfo had refused to delete the concerned data.

Creditinfo, for its part, was arguing that a letter dated March 16, 2020, had been sent to the complainant, and provided evidence thereof  to the Icelandic DPA. Credit info further specified than in case the individual does no longer live at the indicated address, the letter is normally returned, and the address is corrected by taking into account the data of the National Registry. In that case, however, Creditinfo informed the Icelandic DPA that the letter had not been returned.","1.

"In 2017, an employee (the Complainant) had been subject to a formal reprimand by his employer (the Company), but had allegedly not been informed about it. Two years later, after being subject to a second reprimand, the Complainant learned about the first formal reprimand against him, and orally requested the Company to provide him with a written copy of it. The Company, however, did not provide him with a written copy of the first reprimand.

In that context, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA against the Company, arguing that the Company had never provided him with a copy of the first formal reprimand against him, despite his (alleged) oral request. The Complainant considered in particular that the Company had acted in violation of the principle of transparency and fairness set in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and of his right to access set in Article 15 GDPR.

In the course of the proceedings, the Company argued that the Complainant had never personally requested a copy of the reprimand, but that his union had done so in January 2021.

"On 18 December 2019, the DPA received a complaint from regarding the processing of personal information about a data subject by a credit rating company Creditinfo, in connection with the preparation of reports on his credit rating.

According to the complainant, for the purposes of the credit rating, Creditinfo stored and used information about his previous defaults with a bank, despite the fact that they have been settled for a long time. The complainant had requested a correction of the assessment, as he found information on his previous defaults unreliable and misleading. He demanded to stop the processing in the Creditinfo default register and requested information on the method used to calculate his credit rating.

According to Creditinfo, its current operating license states that information on individual debts should be deleted if it is known that they have been returned. Information from the register shall be deleted when it is four years old. The company may store information for additional three years and may use the information to comply with requests from registered individuals. The previous registrations that had affected the complainant's credit rating at the time the complaint was filed were dated 27 June 2017 and 14 June 2018 and were therefore less than four years old.

"Joannahuset (the controller) is a crisis center offering shelter and support to children and young people in vulnerable situations. On one occasion, in connection with obtaining consent for a child's registration for shelter, the controller requested to receive the child's name and social security number via SMS. The Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) became aware of this situation and started an ex officio investigation.

According to the controller, the event occurred in the evening, when the child's custodian was no longer in the office and therefore could only be reached via SMS, and not by secure mail or any other equivalent secure communication method. The controller argued that it was legally obliged to check the identity of the child and receive the custodian's consent before accepting the child to the shelter. If it would not have reached out to the custodian via SMS, the child would have been left to spend the night on the street.","1. The case involves a covered entity (Joannahuset) and an individual (the child) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).
2. The case describes a situation where the covered entity (Joannahuset) required the individual (the child) to provide personal data (name and social security number) in an insecure manner (SMS) as a condition for the provision of shelter (Article 2).
3. The policy explicitly states that covered entities cannot require individuals to provide personal data in an insecure manner as a condition for the provision of services (Article 3).
4. Therefore, the case is considered COMPLIANT with respect to the policy.

The case is COMPLIANT with respect to the policy because the policy does not explicitly state that covered entities cannot require individuals to provide personal data in an insecure manner as a condition for the provision of services. Instead, the policy focuses on the security measures that covered entities must implement to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data. In this case, Joannahuset's actions were necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the child, and the policy does not provide specific guidance on situations where covered entities may need to bypass security measures to protect individuals. Therefore, the case is considered COMPLIANT with respect to the policy.

However, it is important to note that the policy does require covered entities to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services. In this case, Joannahuset's actions may have put the child's personal data at risk, and the Danish DPA's decision to consider the case COMPLIANT may have been based on the specific circumstances of the case rather than a strict interpretation of the policy.

In summary, the case is COMPLIANT with respect to the policy because the policy does not explicitly prohibit covered entities from requiring individuals to provide personal data in an insecure manner as a condition for the provision of services. However, the case highlights the importance of implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data, and the Danish DPA's decision to consider the case COMPLIANT may have been based on the specific circumstances of the case rather than a strict interpretation of the policy.

To ensure compliance with the policy, covered entities should implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services. Covered entities should also ensure that any natural person acting under their authority who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless they are required to do so by Union or Member State law.

In addition, covered entities should regularly test, assess, and evaluate the effectiveness of their technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing. Compliance with these requirements may be demonstrated based on adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42.

In the case of Joannahuset, the Danish DPA's decision to consider the case COMPLIANT may have been based on the specific circumstances of the case rather than a strict interpretation of the policy. However, the case highlights the importance of implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data, and covered entities should take steps to ensure that they are in compliance with the policy's written specifications and stipulations.

To ensure compliance with the policy, covered entities should:

1. Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services.
2. Ensure that any natural person acting under their authority who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless they are required to do so by Union or Member State law.
3. Regularly test, assess, and evaluate the effectiveness of their technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.
4. Comply with the policy's written specifications and stipulations to ensure that they are in compliance with the policy.

In summary, the case is COMPLIANT with respect to the policy because the policy does not explicitly prohibit covered entities from requiring individuals to provide personal data in an insecure manner as a condition for the provision of services.

"The controller is the Belgian tax authority (Algemene Administratie van de Bijzondere Belastinginspectie). The complainant provides tax advice services. The data subjects are (1) the complainant (hereinafter: Tax Advisor) and its (2) customers (hereinafter: Customers).

The Tax Advisor was involved in a criminal investigation into tax fraud, forgery of documents, and the use of false documents. The investigation was still pending when the DPA issued the decision.

The controller used the Tax Advisor’s criminal records for an investigation into tax evasion of his Customers. These documents only contained personal data of the Customers. The controller’s notice to the Customers of the investigation contained the Tax Advisor’s personal data (full name; address; data of birth).

The Tax Advisor issued a complaint with the DPA for unlawful processing of personal data. He stated that it damaged his reputation and breached his clients' confidentiality, which cost him customers.

Regarding the data from his criminal records, the Tax Advisor stated that it did relate to him because (1) he processed it in the context of his independent professional activity and (2) it was obtained from his criminal records. He further argued that customer data is covered by professional secrecy and thus cannot be processed for tax purposes.

The controller stated that the notice to the Customers, on its own, did not fall under the definition of 'filing system' under Article 4(6). Therefore the GDPR was not applicable.","1.

The complainant alleged that the controller had these cameras installed for ""many months"" without putting up signs that warned passersby and disclosed the contact details of the controller.

The controller responded that the complaint was filed by the same neighbor who had filed the first complaint, and it was filed the same day their GDPR-compliant signs had been stolen. The signs had been stolen three times. Because of the minimal value of the signs (roughly €7), the controller had not filed a police report, but they provided invoices from the copy shop where they had replacements printed.","1.

"The controller was an insurer, and the data subject was one of their policy holders. In 2012, the data subject subject suffered a whiplash injury in a car accident and was later diagnosed with ""post-traumatic depressive adjustment disorder with somatization."" In 2014, the data subject filed a claim with the controller for occupational disability; the data subject had been self-employed as a management consultant and energy technician. The controller rejected the claim on the basis that the data subject had not provided adequate proof of disability. On October 28, 2015, the data subject applied to the district court of Wels for a conditional payment order to be issued against the controller. At the time of the DPA's decision, the civil proceedings were suspended. In 2016, the controller offered the data subject a one-time payment of €25,000, which the data subject rejected. The insurance contract between the two parties was terminated in October 2017.

On May 13, 2019, the data subject emailed an access request, requesting specifically the ""risk assessment"" associated with her contract and the ""reserve amount"" associated with her disability claim. In a response dated Nobember 27, 2019, the controller asked the data subject for an explanation of what she meant by those terms. On April 26, 2020, the data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA alleging that the controller had violated her right of access and additionally requested all of her personal data processed by the controller. The controller responded that it had answered the data subject's access request to the best of its ability and that the terms she used were not meaningful to the firm. The controller claimed the data subject believed she was entitled to an insurance payout and was abusing data protection law for her benefit in the related civil procedure. As the complaint was the first time the data subject had requested all her personal data, the controller sent a 200-page response including among others her tariff type, the surrender value paid out, her responses on a medical questionaire, and payment history.

The data subject disagreed that this information was comprehensive, insisting that, because the controller had offered her a settlement, it must have calculated a case-related accrual amount. The controller denied this, explaining that accrual amounts were calculated in aggregate, not on a specific, case-by-case basis. On June 7, 2021, the DPA rejected the data subject's complaint because it had responded to her access request with all the information available to it; the missing information she continued to request was never available to the controller. The data subject appealed, requesting an on-site investigation of the data held by the controller.","1.

When the data subject lost some money, he demanded a refund from company B, claiming that the company's online gambling services were illegal, at least in Austria from where the data subject accessed the online casino. Company B then refunded the money.

The data subject later opened account with a different online gambling company (hereinafter: company C), which was a part of the same group of companies as company B. The data subject once again demanded a refund of his losses. He based it on the same claim as before: alleged illegality. However, company C refused to give a refund. The data subject then brought the dispute to court.

Company C wanted to defend itself in the legal proceedings by demonstrating that the data subject abused his rights by claiming refunds whenever he lost money. For this reason, company B transferred the data subject's personal data to company C. The personal data concerned the data subject's previous refund claim at company B. Company C then transferred this data to the law firm representing it in the legal proceedings (the controller).

As a result, the data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA against the controller about the use of his personal data in the court proceedings. He stated that the exchange of personal data from company B to company C was neither covered by the privacy policy of company B nor did he give consent to it.

4. The policy also states that Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing 'for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject' and 'for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller' by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX 'Provisions relating to specific processing situations' (Article 6).

The complainant requested access to the phone call, to whose recording they could not object. In response, the controller provided only a transcript of the phone conversation. Consequently, the complainant sent another letter specifically requesting a ""copy of the call"".  The controller explained that the recording could not be provided and must be requested from superior instances.

Since the requests of the complainant were not fulfilled, on 26 January 2022, they started a claim against the controller before the Spanish DPA. The complaint was based on two grounds. First, in what format should the copy of the phone call be provided. Second, whether the controller had lawfully recorded the call.","1.

"On 12 December 2020, the Icelandic DPA received a complaint from a Danish organization ""Patientforeningen,"" representing a data subject. The complaint  concerned a letter from the Danish Biobank addressed at the data subject, which stated that the body tissues collected from the data subject were sent to deCode Genetics in Iceland to be processed and stored by deCode Genetics.  The complaint pointed out that according to the website of the research project, the Capital Region of Denmark is the controller and deCode Genetics is the processor of the processing.

The complaint contended the following:

1. The processing of personal data in Iceland is without authorization.

2. The personal data in question is outside the scope of data protection impact assessment (DPIA) carried out in Denmark. Moreover, it is unclear whether deCode Genetics carried out any DPIA.

3. The genetic information is processed without the permission of the Central Scientific Ethics Committee in Iceland.

4. The processing of genetic data is done without permission from the Icelandic DPA.

The complaint claimed that although the agreement between Danish Biobank and deCode Genetics stated deCode Genetics to be the processor, it was in fact acting as a controller and thus had to be responsible for the obligations of a controller. This claim was on the basis that the articles published regarding the research identified individuals from deCode Genetics as first and last authors. Usually in the scientific community, the first author is the real contributor, and hence the main decision authority.

In reply, deCode Genetics claimed that it is the Danish DPA which has the jurisdiction since the data subject is Danish and the data is primarily registered and stored in Denmark. deCode Genetics submitted that the Danish DPA was already looking into similar cases and hence is the most appropriate authority. deCode Genetics cited its other collaborative research projects and claimed that it was recognized as a processor in them. It claimed that this project, for which it is the processor, was approved by the Danish Scientific Ethics Committee. It also stated that it had carried out its obligations as a processor as mentioned in Article 28 GDPR, and had submitted the requisite information to the appropriate medical facility in the Capital Region of Denmark. With respect to the lack of approval from Icelandic authorities, deCode Genetics claimed that in multinational research, permission is sought from those authorities where the research population and the person responsible for research are located. It submitted that this principle is applicable even when a part of the processing is carried out in another country.","1.

"The data subject logded a complaint with the Spanish DPA against Banco de Sabadell, the controller, whose main establishment is located in Spain. The complaint was based on the right of access executed by the data subject and the fact that the controller handed over a copy containing only the personal data from the data subject’s file and not the detailed transactions from the account.

Next, the complaint was sent to the Spanish DPA through a system aimed for cross-border administrative cooperation and mutual assistance between the Member States and according to Article 56(1) GDPR, due to the cross-border character of the complaint and the competence of the Spanish DPA as lead supervisor authority.

Under Article 60 GDPR, the following DPAs were identified as “concerned supervisory authorities” under Article 4(22) GDPR: the Netherlands, Italy, France and Portugal, since data subjects who reside on their territory might be substantially affected by the processing analysed in this case. On the other hand, the Polish DPA also claimed interest since the controller operated on its territory.

The controller claimed that the data subject did not specify the extent of the request in the sense of detailing either the data, purpose or processing operation which they wanted to access. Additionally, the controller interpreted the request as a demand for the “personal data used by the bank”, considering firstly, the information already provided on the website and in the contract according to Article 13 GDPR and, secondly, to avoid that the right to access results in excessive data disclosure, considering the amount of data handled.

Furthermore, in the same document, the controller provided information regarding the application “Banca a distancia” (long-distance banking) which allows to visualise and check the movements and operations on the account. The controller also stated to be at the client’s disposal to extend or clarify the request.

The bank provided the data subject with a copy of all the personal information processed in the bank's activities. However, it rejected the request to the extent that it concerned the e-mail communication of its employees, stating that another controller is concerned, namely, a workers' union.

The bank speculated that the complainant is trying to access personal information from the activities of a third party through the bank.

The data subject responded that the bank's arguments for refusing his access request do not stand up to scrutiny. The data request is directed to the bank because it is known that the bank's email address was used for the processing and distribution of information about the data subject and, therefore, the request is rightly directed to it.

ANSWER:
The case is COMPLIANT with respect to the policy.

The Norwegian DPA's decision not to carry out investigations in this case because it fell outside the scope of their area of responsibility outlined by Article 57(1)(a) GDPR is considered COMPLIANT with respect to the policy.

The Norwegian DPA's decision not to carry out investigations in this case because it fell outside the scope of their area of responsibility outlined by Article 57(1)(a) GDPR is consistent with the policy's written specifications and stipulations.

The policy explicitly states that each supervisory authority shall on its territory: monitor and enforce the application of this Regulation (Article 57(1)(a)). However, the policy also states that each supervisory authority shall on its territory: handle complaints lodged by a data subject, or by a body, organisation or association in accordance with Article 80, and investigate, to the extent appropriate, the subject matter of the complaint and inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the investigation within a reasonable period, in particular if further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority is necessary (Article 57(1)(f)).

In this case, the Norwegian DPA found no basis for conducting investigations in this area and recommended that the data subject re-direct any questions about municipality controls and routines for handling personal data to the municipality Data Protection Officer (DPO) and closed the case on 29 April 2021. The data subject was granted access to the child welfare records and proceeded to complain one more time to the DPA, asking to reassess the controller's handling of confidential personal data in an e-mail on 7 December 2021.

The camera is 1.2km from the gas station, has a range of 60 meters and is installed in the upstairs apartment, which does not belong to the controller, but to his relatives.  The complaint has been denied because it was proven that the camera was directed only towards the access door to the garage. Although it affects the sidewalk, the dimensions are limited to a scope that is considered essential to preserve the persons and property that are in the purpose for which the camera is installed.

"The data subject has a phone contract with the controller. The incident in question concerned the controller's accidental reassigning of the data subject's phone number to a third party. The phone number on the data subject's phone became inactive and active on the phone of the third party. The dispute between the parties concerned the question whether the incident involved a security breach which should have been notified. Moreover, the parties have differing opinions about whether personal data of the data subject was made available to a third party and whether the security measures of the controller were sufficient.

The data subject argued that a third party had acquired access to personal data, such as text messages that could have been received at the phone number after it was reassigned. Additionally, the third-party would have been capable of accessing personal data of the data subjects on websites and smart apps that use the phone number as an identifier.

The controller argued to the contrary that no security breach occurred.  The incident was caused by a human error on the part of the relevant employee who handed over the phone number to an unauthorized party. No information about previous calls, text messages or other information was made available when the phone number was transferred. The controller also does not see itself responsible for other personal data that may be connected to the data subject's phone number, such as the use of authentication methods in services unrelated to the controller. Furthermore, the controller believed that its current processes minimize the risk of mistakes like this occurring and pointed out that incidents like this have only occurred three times since 2015.

The latter transferred the complaint to the Danish DPA (DPA), which was the lead supervisory authority in this decision (Article 56 GDPR).

According to the data subject, Trustpilot was not allowed to process personal data about him. He also stated that Trustpilot had not responded to his access request. Trustpilot stated that it was a processor for other companies in relation to the sending of such emails. Trustpilot based this assessment on the fact that companies decided to use Trustpilots software and also decided whether and when invitations were send out using Trustpilots software. In addition, it were the companies, in this case, Asus, that provided the personal data used for the invitations. Therefore, Trustpilot was the processor.

"The controller maintained the website ""Íslendingabók"". The website was a database containing genealogical information about the inhabitants of Iceland, dating back more than 1,200 years. A data subject sent a request for deletion of her and her minor child's personal data to the controller. The controller rejected the request, prompting the data subject to complain to the Icelandic DPA. The data subject asked the DPA to decide that the controller was not allowed to register, save, process, publish, and share personal information about her and her child in any possible way.

The data subject argued that she did not give her consent for personal information about her and her minor child to be recorded and published in the Íslendingabók. In addition,she was not informed about that in advance.

The controller, on the other hand, responded that since the database concerned genealogical research, which is a type of scientific and historical research, its data processing could be conducted under the legal basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. The controller also argued that it had a legitimate interest in processing the personal data which overrode the interests of the data subjects to have their data deleted. The controller pointed out that they promote genealogical research in Iceland by running the database: ""Genealogical research, which has been carried out in Iceland for centuries, is very popular with the public and is one of the main pillars of the nation's cultural heritage.

"Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (the controller) allegedly used facial recognition programmes to confirm the identity of students (data subjects) taking online exams during the Covid-19 pandemic. The controller used an IT tool from Smowl Tech (the processor) which had to be installed on the data subjects' devices. This app used the front camera to register the data subject's face while taking the exam, but it also captured the computer’s desktop. An additional camera had ot be installed on the students’ devices, as a mandatory condition to sit an exam. The second camera captured the data subject's work environment, focusing on their hands, body and work screens. A failure to install and use these cameras would result in failing the exam.

A Students’ Association, 11 individuals and several other associations submitted complaints to the Spanish DPA against the controller's prcoessing activities. The complaints regarding the second camera sustained that it was disproportionate since it could also capture third parties. Regarding the software, the consent required was not valid because students who had a high-risk profile for Covid-19 did not have a choice. Others argued that the controller did not have a legitimate interest in obliging data subjects to install a software on their devices where they keep their agendas, bank apps, private communications, keywords, etc.

The controller claimed that none of the cameras used facial recognition techniques (which was supported with an attestation of the processor as evidence). Thus, consent was not mandatory as a legal basis but ‘necessity for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest conferred by the national law of Universities (Ley Orgánica de Universidades). The controller denied that any software was installed for the use of the second camera on the data subject's devices. Furthermore, the software installed for the frontal camera did not access data subjects' personal information unless they showed the data on their screen when the desktop was recorded. However, the controller provided data subjects with the information that screenshots taken by the tool were taken if the data subject accessed a tab not compatible with the exam. These screenshots were evaluated by the controller and deleted in case that no fraud was found. The controller also applied a variety of technical and organisational measures: a proportionality test, assessment of the security provided by the processor, implementation of the principles of privacy by design and default, risk assessments, and DPIAs.","1.

"Background

About a month after the ""Schrems II ruling"" by the CJEU (CJEU - C-311/18 - Schrems II) the NGO noyb filed 101 complaints regarding data transfers from EEA based websites to Google LLC and Facebook Inc. in the U.S (see here and here). In order to coordinate the work of all involved DPAs, the EDPB created a special task force.

Complaint

On 18.08.2020, a data subject (represented by noyb) filed a complaint with the DSB against both the website provider (in its role as data exporter) and Google LLC (in its role as data importer), arguing that both respondents violated Articles 44 et. seqq. GDPR in light of the ""Schrems II"" ruling by transferring their personal data to Google LLC. As Google LLC qualifies as ""electronic communication service provider"" under 50 U.S. Code § 1881(b)(4), it is subject to surveillance by U.S. intelligence services and can be ordered to disclose data of European citizens - such as the data subject - to them.

The complaint was filed against the Spanish Royal Academy (Real Academia Española, ""RAE"").

The controller alleged that it is a public law institution that uses Google Analytics tools solely and exclusively for fulfilling the general interest purposes that constitute its ultimate goal, which is to ensure the development, dissemination, proper use and update of the Spanish language; in order to achieve that, it is necessary to have access to statistical data related to the access and use of these instruments, and also to know its evolution and adaptation to the reality of the use of the language at any given moment (e.g. statistics related to the use of terms not included in the dictionary can allow a better knowledge of the evolution in the use of the language and the possible inclusion of such terms in the future).

Through the use of Google Analytics, the controller can know essential information related to the use of the language and its diffusion worldwide.

The controller also alleged that it only had access to aggregated data that did not allow for identification of users. The controller had no access to personal data whatsoever, nor IPs or any other information. Hence, no personal data was processed.

The controller also indicated that it had subscribed a contract with Google LLC (Conditions for the Processing of Data) and that therefore the RAE was a controller while Google was a processor.

Furthermore, the controller alleged that it had only used the most basic functionalities of Google Analytics, guaranteeing the minimization of the use of data, so only aggregated data was processed.

Only the following data was gathered:

1. Identification of the geographic area (city and country) from which the user of the user accessed the website and statistics by country.  
2. Language.  
3. Source from which the visit originates.  
4. Statistical flow of visits to the Web Site.  
5. Statistical analysis of visits, offering percentages of recurrent or first access visits.  
6. Browser used for access.  
7. Type of mobile device used.  
8. Screen resolution of the device and its operating system. 

Nor Google Signals nor Comparatives were activated.

On 08.09.2020, the AEPD verified that the code of the website included the creation and storage of Google Analytics cookies.

On 27.10.2021, the AEPD confirmed that such code was not on the website anymore.","1. The case involves a covered entity (RAE) and an individual (the data subject) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

"The data subject is a computer gamer. The controller Reto Moto ApS, a Danish game developer.

During the game experience, the data subject displayed an undesirable behaviour and was accused of breaking the game's code of conduct. In other words, according to the controller, the data subject was suspected of cheating. It is not clear from the decision if the data subject was banned from the game.

On 30 May 2019, the data subject filed an access request at the controller pursuant to Article 15 GDPR. It is not clear from the decision what the data subject specifically requested. In its response, on 26 June 2019, the controller clarified that data about game replay, anti-cheat related information, server logs and in-game chat messages would not be disclosed to the data subject. On 28 June 2019, the data subject informed the controller that the reply was incomplete in his opinion. According to the data subject, anti-cheat information was usually really private information, since anti-cheat software usually contains techniques that are used to get an exceptional level of access to a computer. The data subject had no control over the software once it was installed. The data subject was also of the opinion this anti-cheat information contained personal data, and was therefore subject to the GDPR. On 26 June 2019, the controller confirmed that it had answered to the access request. The controller also confirmed that it did not provide the Game replay data, Server logs, anti-cheat information and In-game chat messages.

The controller stated that it did not provide a copy of the game replay data and the server logs because the controller had deleted these before receiving the data subject's access request.

The controller also explained that it did not provide access to the anti-cheat information, because this could harm the controller and other players. This information, it was argued, constituted a technical log with data explaining why the data subject should be excluded from the game because of supposed cheating. The controller also stated that these logs included very few personal data. According to the controller, the data subject had been provided with the reason for his exclusion and was also made aware of the time of the cheating, which was in violation with the game terms of service. The technical log also included information about the software used by the data subject to cheat. The controller meant that this did not constitute personal data and was also of the opinion that this information was strictly confidential, since disclosing this information might reveal how players could cheat in the game, which would harm the controller itself and other players of the game.

With regard to the in-game messages, the controller explained it's reasoning for not including in-game chat messages in the copy. The controller explained that it could not remove personal data of other data subjects in these chats, since these messages contained several different languages that the controller did not understand. According to the controller, these chat messages were also written in jargon, which made it even harder for the controller to understand the proper context of the messages. Due to these factors, the controller stated that it could not guarantee that a copy of in-game messages would not result in the disclosure of personal data of other players. For this reason, the controller was of the opinion that the protection of rights and freedoms of other players outweighed the interest of the data subject in receiving access to personal data.

On 17 July 2019,  the data subject filed a complaint about the controller's answer at the DPA. The DPA continued to review the case.","1. The case involves a covered entity (Reto Moto ApS) and an individual (the data subject) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

"The controller is the Icelandic Office of the National Medical Examiner. The controller was established by national law and supervised health services and health workers and dealt with complaints from the public regarding health services. The data subject was the head of a medical department. At an unspecified time, ""association X"", a non-profit organisation representing the interests of patients, sent a message to the controller which criticised the management of the data subject's department and made suggestions to its improvement. Considering the suggestions, the controller started an official investigation case.

According the Icelandic administrative law, the complainant is a party to the investigation. Further, based on law no.  37/1993 on ""The Right to Information and the Duty to Provide Guidance"", the parties to a case enjoy the right to be informed about it. Therefore, after the association sent multiple inquiries, the controller shared personal information about the data subject (the head of the department) in a letter which included, among other things, information that the data subject had been placed on indefinite leave and another person had taken over his job.

Subsequently, the data subject issued a complaint the Icelandic DPA and argued that the controller had no legal basis for the processing. The data subject believed that the comments of the controller in the letter, regarding his indefinite leave, were presented as if they were specific sanctions due to what was stated in the criticism of association X. Moreover, the data subject believed that the association X was not a party in the investigation case and, thus, disclosure of such information could not have been possibly based on a law. (The data subject's arguments, as presented by the decision, do not go further in depth. However, it can be presumed that the data subject is, in effect, arguing the following: First, if the processing of the personal data can not be based on a law, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR cannot be used as a legal basis. Second, there is no apparent legitimate interest present for the processing which would overwrite the data subject's interests in the personal data not being disclosed, as would have been required for Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Therefore, there had been no legal basis for the processing which made it unlawful.)

"The controller was a secondary school. The data subject had been a teacher at the school.

In November 2018, the data subject requested a meeting with her fellow teachers to discuss the case of another teacher (teacher C) who, according to her, had been bullied for years. The data subject defended teacher C and, among other things, requested that a psychologist was brought in to assess the situation. According to the school administrator, the data subject had been insulting and shown a lack of respect for her colleagues in view of the sensitive topic of discussion during the meeting. Following the incident, the administrator received emails from the data subject's fellow teachers concerning the improper behaviour of the data subject.

In February 2019, the controller was informed by the Ministry of Education about a complaint by the data subject, in which she argued that she had suffered mental abuse in the  November 2018 meeting.

The same year, the school was required to rearrange its employment structure in the course of which the data subject and teacher C were dismissed.  In November 2019, the school received a letter from the Parliamentary Ombudsman, requesting the school's opinion regarding the joint complaint of the data subject and teacher C, who argued that their dismissals had been illegal.

In 2021, the data subject sent a complaint to the Icelandic DPA. She argued that after she had sent her complaint to the Ministry, the school administer started collecting her personal data through her former colleagues and shared it with the Ministry. Both happened without her consent (see Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) and without informing her of the existence of the data (see Article 14 GDPR). The illegally processed personal data would be used against her in the proceedings in front of the Ministry and the Ombudsman.

The administer of the school denied having actively collected information about the data subject from other teachers. The existing information was sent by other teachers to the administrator as a reaction to the data subject's behaviour in the 2018 meeting. All emails containing personal data, to which the data subject's complain related, were dated between January and February 1, 2019. However, the Ministry did not inform the controller about the complaint procedure until February 11, 2019. The controller also argued that the personal data was created due to the administrator's work activities and was therefore not obtained from a third party. As a result, Articles 13 and 14 GDPR would not apply and the controller would be absolved of its information obligation to the data subject.","1.

"The controller in this case was a department of the King's office that deals with social affairs. A data subject had a dispute with a public authority, more precisely, the Government of the German-speaking Community (hereafter, the ""Government"") which had only partially responded to his request for information. The data subject wrote several complaint letters to the King. These letters contained personal data: his surname, first name and address. In an attempt to solve the matter, the King's office (controller) that had received these letters transferred them to the Government.

The data subject became aware of such disclosure and subsequently submitted an access request with the controller in accordance with Article 15 GDPR. Among the other things, he specifically inquired about the transfer of his data to the Government. The controller did not respond to his requests. The data subject also doubted the overall lawfulness of the processing. In particular, he argued that the transfer of his data was not necessary, since the controller could have simply interceded with the Government to remind it to respond to the requests for information.

He therefore filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA. During the investigation, the controller argued that the King's Office and its services benefit from the immunity from jurisdiction granted to the King under Article 88 of the Belgian Constitution.","1.

"The controller in this case was Meta Platforms Technologies Ireland Limited (hereafter Meta).

Following a suspected data leakage concerning around 3,000,000 Belgian Facebook users, on 7 April 2021, the Belgian DPA called on Belgian citizens to check on the website https://benikerbij.be whether their data were part of the data leakage and if necessary to lodge a complaint with the DPA. Following this call, 1,113 complaints were lodged.

On 14 April 2021, the Irish DPC opened its “own volition inquiry” to determine whether Meta complied with its privacy obligations with the functionalities Facebook Search, Facebook Contact Importer, Messenger Contact and Instagram Contact. On 29 July 2021, the Irish DPC was notified of the existence of complaints regarding the events under investigation with the Belgian DPA.

In September 2022, under Article 60(3) GDPR, the DPC submitted a draft decision to various DPA’s, including the Belgian one who communicated their objections. In particular, in contrast to what the DPC had held, the Belgian DPA considered that data scraping should have been considered a data breach and that Meta had a duty to inform its users of the data leakage.

On 25 November 2022, the DPC adopted its final decision. Its investigation revealed that in the Facebook search tool, the default settings allowed all users to find each other's profiles via their phone numbers or email addresses (with a possibility to deactivate it manually). It therefore concluded that there was a strong risk that the phone numbers and email addresses would be scraped and linked to the identity of their owners. It also held that after the leakage, Meta did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures and failed to demonstrate that it had conducted a risk analysis.

Therefore, the DPC found a violation of  Article 25(1), 25(2), 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(f) GDPR, ordered Meta to comply with the provisions and imposed a Є150,000,000 and a Є115,0000 fine respectively for the violations of Articles 25(1) and 25(2).","1.

2. The case describes a situation where the covered entity (Meta) did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures and failed to demonstrate that it had conducted a risk analysis (Article 25(1) and 25(2)).
3. The policy explicitly states that the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects (Article 25(1)).
4. The policy also explicitly states that the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons (Article 25(2)).

The State Administrator rejected the complaint and informed that the Norwegian DPA is the correct complaint body in the case.

The data subject the again contacted the DPA requesting clarification on who is the competent appeal body but the DPA maintained its own view.

The data subject appealed against this decision, but The DPA rejected the complaint on the grounds that it had been submitted after the appeal deadline of three weeks and did not find any special reasons that made it reasonable for the complaint to be nevertheless processed. The data subject also contacted the Civil Ombudsman which rejected the case and referred the data subject to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board.","1. The case involves a covered entity (NAV) and an individual (the data subject) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

In connection with the employment at Securitas, the data subject was contacted by the Defense Intelligence Service (DK: Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste) (“FE”) as the data subject had been nominated for a security clearance, and therefore, was viewed to have been filled out an electronic form for the processing.

The data subject complained to the Danish DPA about Securitas disclosing their personal data to the FE, as the data subject stated that they had not consented to such disclosure. The data subject stated that Securitas had disclosed their personal data (job title, full name, and social security number).

The data subject argued that they had not completed the “information form 2” to which Securitas referred to, and therefore, no declaration of consent had been given. The data subject argued that their personal data had been disclosed to the FE without their knowledge.

Securitas argued that the disclosure of the data subject’s personal data to the FE as well as the PET was justified. Securitas stated that, at the time of the disclosure of personal data, the complainant was employed as a security guard and that all such “on-call employees” are informed of the requirement for security clearance through a communication portal.

"After the Norwegian DPA rejected a data subject’s complaint regarding alleged unlawful credit assessment, the case was forwarded to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board (PAB) to conclude an assessment.

The data subject complained about the fact that a company operating a car rental platform (the controller) credit assessed them when the data subject wanted to rent a car through the company's platform. The car rental platform in question connects users wanting to rent out their car, and users who want to rent someone else's car.

The car rental platform has committed to cover any possible additional expenses (such as tolls, extra kilometers driven, parking fees, compensations) to car owner(s), as well as, deductibles to the insurance company in cases of damage. Thereafter, the car rental platform claims the expenses form the car renter. Regarding a deposit, the car rental platform consideres a deposit inadequate, since a deposit high enough to cover the financial risks would make the rental price unacceptably high. This said, the controller argued that it is necessary to credit assess renters.

The controller carried out a credit assessment on the data subject when the data subject wanted to rent a car through its platform. Due to a payment notice, the data subject was prohibited to rent a car through the platform.

The Spanish DPA has rejected the complaint because there were informational signs in the area indicating the video surveillance and there was no evidence that the controller is processing the data subject's personal data.

6. Therefore, the case is considered COMPLIANT with respect to the policy.

The verdict is COMPLIANT because the Spanish DPA has rejected the complaint due to the absence of evidence that the controller is processing the data subject's personal data. The presence of informational signs in the area indicating the video surveillance also supports the conclusion that the case is COMPLIANT.

"Information of the ethnicity of a child's parent (the data subject) appeares in a journal note of the child welfare services of a Norwegian municipality (the controller). The journal note is a reproduction of what information the data subject themself had provided to the controller.

Additionally, the data subject had expressed to the controller that they feel that the child welfare case is about racism and represents a witch hunt against them from the municipality's side because of their family's belonging to a minority group.

The data subject requested the controller to delete information on their ethnicity pursuant to Article 17 GDPR from their child's records, because they viewed that such information was irrelevant with regard to the controller handling their child's case. The controller refused to delete the information, because it argued to have a statutory obligation to document and archive the information under national law. The data subject complained about the controller's refusal to delete the data to the Norwegian DPA.

The DPA found that the exceptions under Article 17(3)(b) and (d) GDPR applied in this case, since the controller had vuewed the information as worthy of archiving in accordance with archiving obligations laid down by national law. Therefore, the Norwegian DPA held that the controller had not violated the data subject's right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR by refusing to delete the data.

"In December 2020, the DPA received a complaint by the complainant that their authorisation had been invoked by Netgíró ehf. (the controller) due to credit rating information given by Creditinfo Lánstrausts without prior to informing the claimant i.e. data subject of data transmission.

The data subject argued that to gain access to Creditinfo's information about themself, they had to agree to the company's use of certain additional information from its debt position system when calculating their credit rating. Additionally, Creditinfo allegedly used incorrect information from the debt position system in the calculation, as the IL fund communicated information to the system about the complainant's debt to the fund even though they had already paid the debt in question.

Netgíró ehf. have been prohibited from using information about Creditinfo's credit rating, which has been incorrectly calculated, and that the company is obliged to notify the borrower (this case the complainant) in advance when it intends to cancel the borrower's authorization due to changes in Creditinfo's credit rating.

The defendants in this case argued that the data subject had in fact been notified and reminded that they can withdraw their consent at any point and that Creditinfo was considered a processor in the debt position system.","1.

The CGRA responded to the data subject that the employee only had his best interests at heart, i.e. an effective and swift procedure. Unsatisfied, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA.

In its defense, the controller stressed that it provides its employees with work equipment and that there is no BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy.

"The data subject was active member of a religious community. They also held an official spiritual role within the church. After many years of service, an internal committee held that data subject committed a serious sin and publicly declared that they were no longer a member of the community.

The data subject claimed that by this public announcement the controller unlawfully processed their personal data. The data subject also requested access and erasure of some personal data and objected to the processing.

The controller claimed that data were processed pursuant to Articles 6(1)(c) and (f) and 9(2)(d) and (f) GDPR. Moreover, a religious organisation enjoys a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights and the European Treaties. The processing at issue fell therefore outside the State’s competence. The controller also stated to have fully replied to the access request.

The data subject claimed that at the time of their baptism they were only 13 and therefore not able to understand all the legal implications of the affiliation for their right to data protection. They also claimed that it would have been sufficient to bring their expulsion to the attention of only two people, without any need for a public announcement. Thus, the data subject lodged a complaint.","1.

"The data subject wanted to deposit cash in the amount of ISK 99,000 (approx. € 700) into their daughter’s bank account at Landsbankans hf. (the bank or the controller).

The bank requested for the data subject’s social security number due to the banking transaction in question. The data subject considered that to be unlawful and claimed, inter alia, that the law on actions against money laundering and the financing of terrorism 140/2018 (Law 140/2018) does not require financial institutions - such as the bank - to identify the customers when the amount of the transaction does not reach a certain threshold amount.

The bank argued that it has a statutory obligation to prohibit anonymous transactions. In addition, the bank highlighted that the collection of social security numbers is important for the sake of the security and traceability of transactions. In other words, it is to ensure the reliability of transactions, to be able to correct possible mistakes in processing and/or to inform about identity theft, fraud, money laundering or other criminal acts.","1.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy.

However, the case states that the data subject's lawyer filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA, which indicates that the data subject was aware of the processing of their personal data and the potential noncompliance with the policy. This awareness could be interpreted as an implicit acknowledgement of the data subject's rights and the processing of their personal data. Therefore, the case could be considered COMPLIANT based on this implicit acknowledgement. However, the case does not provide sufficient evidence to support this interpretation.

The data subject wanted to conduct a genealogical investigation on his family surname. He sent an email to the Directorate of Primary Education (the controller), requesting access to their pupil registration database to search the entries of his surname therein.  In addition, the data subject requested in his complaint that the Authority order the Directorate of Primary Education to allow him immediate research access to the books of the closed/abolished Primary School's curriculum, to research the surname entries in them. The controller replied that they were only able to provide him with numerical data (number of pupils per year) and not the names, as this would be an unlawful disclosure of personal data.

The Authority dismissed the complaint, holding that there was no violation of the data subject's rights and that access requests for research purposes was not within the competence of the Authority to order. In particular, the Authority considered that his request to the controller (Directorate Primary Education) did not constitute an exercise of the right of access to personal data concerning him/her under Article 15 GDPR, but a request to carry out scientific research.

On 26 October 2022, the data subject lodged an objection to the decision and a request for a review of his case, in which he alleged that his request was ""not a request to carry out scientific research, but a personal genealogical research, which is far from scientific research and the data in the requested search concern him and thus fall under Article 15 GDPR.""","1.

"From 1 November 2017 until 30 September 2019 the data subject was a temporary employee at the Single Resolution Board (SRB). On 29 September 2019, via email, the data subject requested from SRB a copy of all his personal data and all data referring to his person stored at SRB, based on the Regulation 2018/1725. This was because there had been two instances of access to his personal data stored in the European Commission’s personnel management IT system, on 12 June 2019. Thus, he wanted the EDPS to investigate whether those instances of access could have constituted a breach of his personal data. He also requested that measures be taken to prevent any unauthorised access, modification, processing or disclosure of his personal data stored at the SRB. On 17 February 2020, he reiterated his request to the SRB to confirm whether or not personal (in particular, HR-related) data concerning him was being processed, to provide a copy of his personal data and to restrict the processing of his personal data, while objecting to the processing of his personal data.

On 28 February 2020, the DPO replied the data subject with certain data concerning him, stating that SRB applies by analogy the Common Commission-level retention list for European Commission files and in view of Articles 11, 26, 81 and 127 of the applicable Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union and Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union, the SRB had the legal obligation to store personal file in accordance with the retention list and that his personal file was now archived and would be stored up to 8 years after the extinction of all his rights, and for at least 120 years after his birth date.

On 8 March 2020, the data subject requested the SRB to delete his personal data processed by the latter and reiterated his request for restriction of the processing of his personal data and for objection to the processing of such of his personal data which are not to be deleted. By emails of 20 March and 17 and 20 April 2020, the data subject reiterated his request for erasure, withdrawing his consent to the processing of those data by the SRB.

On 30 April 2020, the DPO responded to emails rejecting a request for data erasure. The DPO stated that SRB had a legal obligation to retain the individual's personal file based on European Commission rules and Staff Regulations. The DPO also emphasized that the data could not be deleted and explained the lengthy retention period of 120 years after the individual's birth date. He also mentioned the requirement to keep data in a single personal file to any EU institution as a potential new employer, and some of the data in the personal file were also kept in the context of a further and/or future financial obligation for its staff or their family members. Additionally, the DPO cited legal obligations for data retention under Regulation 2018/1725, which prevented the right to object. Regarding a request for data processing restriction, the DPO asked the applicant to specify the data whose accuracy he disputed according to Regulation 2018/1725.

On 20 March 2020, the data subject lodged a complaint with the EDPS against the SRB claiming that the processing and storage for 120 years violates his rights entitled by Regulation 2018/1725, in particular his right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) of Article 19, right to restriction of processing of Article 20 and the right to object of Article 23.

In the complaint, the data subject then asked the EDPS to instruct the SRB to comply with his requests in exercise of his rights, in particular the requested erasure of his personal data.

On 18 January 2021, the EDPS rejected the complaint by the first contested decision concluding:

* As for the right to erasure of Article 19 of Regulation 2018/1725, read in the light of Article 26 of the Staff Regulations, the SRB was under a legal obligation, within the meaning of Article 19(3)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, to keep the content of the applicant’s personal file. 
* Regarding the right to object to the processing of personal data of Article 23(1) of Regulation 2018/1725, the EDPS recalled that, under Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, processing of those data was lawful if it was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller of the personal data was subject and this  was indeed the case here.
* Request for restriction of the processing of his personal data, based on Article 20(1) of Regulation 2018/1725, the EDPS also considered that it should be refused. First of all, the EDPS rejected the applicant’s argument based on the assumption that his personal data held by the SRB were incomplete or inaccurate. He then noted that the processing was lawful within the meaning of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, since it was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the SRB was subject pursuant to Article 26 of the Staff Regulations.
* Lastly, he recalled that the applicant had no right to object under Article 23 of Regulation 2018/1725, as previously established. The EDPS concluded therefrom that the applicant had no ground, in terms of Article 20(1) of that regulation, to obtain from the SRB a restriction of the processing of his personal data.

After a reviewal request made by the data subject on 17 February 2021, on 9 March 2021, the EDPS refused the applicant’s request for review by the second contested decision.

The data subject claimed for an annulment of the decision by European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) of 18 January 2021 rejecting his complaint (‘the first contested decision’), and of the decision from 9 March 2021 refusing his request for review of the first contested decision (‘the second contested decision’) (together, ‘the contested decisions’) and a compensation of €20,000 for the damage which he claims to have suffered as a result of the contested decisions.","1.

"A data subject visited the  website of the controller, and a cookie banner displayed, showing the options “accept” and “configure or reject use of cookies” the first being included in a button, written in white against a blue background and the latter option is designed as a link in the text of the banner. By accepting cookies, several cookies were installed on the complainant’s device and unique identifiers about the data subject were stored on the controller’s servers and transmitted to third parties; by clicking on “configure or reject use of cookies”, the data subject was redirected to a second layer showing the different categories of non-necessary cookies that one can tick and accept or leave unticked and thus reject, and save the settings. The option to reject cookies is thus only available in the second layer of the banner. In light of these features, the data subject claimed that the way in which the cookie banner was designed violated the GDPR and the consent given through such a banner cannot be considered a valid consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 4(11) GDPR.

"On the 14th of May 2023 a data subject lodged a complaint with the Maltese DPA. He complained that when terminating his employment, his employer (the controller) accessed his work emails and failed to provide him with a right to clear his mailbox. The data subject highlighted that he had personal documents on the account such as electricity bills.

The controller defended himself against these allegations to the DPA under when given the opportunity under Article 58(1)(a) GDPR. The controller stated that the access to the account had been granted desppite the termination of employment. This access had been granted because the data subject had highlighted the personal documents contained on the account. The controller submitted an email of this grant of access as evidence. The data subject was informed that after he had accessed what he required, the account would be deleted permanently.

The data subject rebutted these claims by only claiming that he was 'suspicious' that the government has already 'snooped' into all his mail.

The controller was given one final chance to rebutt the data subject's arguments. The controller gave evidence that at no point had they accessed the data subject's personal data within his work email.

"On 29 August 2023, the Danish DPA initiated a case concerning Rigsrevisionen's data processing. Rigsrevisionen (the processor) is an independent institution placed under the Danish parliament conducting audits to determine whether the public accounts are correct and whether government-funded agencies and enterprises comply with current laws and regulations. The DPA aimed to assess the legal basis of the data processing under Article 6 GDPR and how the processor ensures compliance with the principle of data minimisation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

The processor stated that its tasks follow the Danish Auditor General Act and special legislation. It emphasised that its processing is considered necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and Article 9(2)(g) GDPR. Although the processor further stated that it is not always relevant and necessary for its auditing activities to obtain personal data, its employees are instructed to justify and document if personal data is to be collected.

Following the report, the Danish DPA asked the processor to clarify its utilization of terminal access to access personal data. The processor explained that, in practice, terminal access is primarily used in connection with financial audits. Furthermore, its terminal access to the joint government IT systems, for example, is described in the agreement with the Danish Agency for Public Finance and Management. From the agreement, it appears that the employees of the processor can access the data in the joint governmental systems without contacting the authority whose data the access may concern when they have an official necessity. Nonetheless, ministries and agencies are informed about this automatic access to the information in the systems. Moreover, the processor clarified that it does not have unlimited terminal access to all the auditee's systems or cases, as the audited authority decides whether terminal access should be made available to the processor. Additionally, this system allows it to search for specific accounting documents and data, avoiding retrieving entire cases. The processor also explained that the alternative to this system would be retrieving the information by obtaining documents in physical form, for example. Therefore, it is believed that terminal access supports the principle of data minimisation.","1.

"A student handed in a complaint against the University of Navarra because they asked the students to fill in their vaccination status. The complainant understands this as a breach of the data protection regulation because it would access the students medical records. The grounds are based on an e-mail from the University of Navarra, in which it announces to collaborate with the Navarro Health Service in the Vaccination against COVID-19 and it asks the students to inform about their vaccination status. On October 26, 2021 the University of Navarra replied to the complaint that the students were not coerced to give the information, but they were given the possibility to do so. The University does not process the personal data of the students without their explicit consent. The consent would in no case be vitiated since no condition has been established that could nullify the correct will of the interested party to the processing. There is no measure contrary to the interests of those students who do not provide the information freely and voluntarily.

The police then submitted further evidence, arguing that the data subject had requested the deletion of the information by e-mail dated 28 July 2021, and that it had been dealt with and the data subject informed by the 16 September 2021. The reason for the delay was that during the investigation of the criminal case, it was not known whether all electronic data had weight.

"On 20 August 2020 the data subject, represented by noyb, filed a complaint against eDreams, the controller, with the Spanish DPA. The data subject stated that he visited the eDreams website, while connected to his Google account. His IP address and cookies information were collected and transferred to Google U.S. through the services of Google Analytics and Google Ads, contractualized by eDreams.

The Spanish DPA started an investigation. Based on the documents and the requests made by the Spanish DPA, it was confirmed that Google Analytics statistics were collected from stakeholders in other Member States where eDreams concentrates its activity. The data of the Google Analytics tool is accessed mainly from eDream's offices in Spain, led by the head of the Analytics team, but also from France and Germany by their country management teams in each country.

eDreams stated that they only communicate the data collected through Google Analytics to Google. In the event that the user provides their consent for advertising cookies and does not block cookies in its browser, Google Ad Manager and Google Ads tools will also be recipients of the data. The controller specified that legal basis for the incorporation of the Google Analytics tool was legitimate interest, based on the need to understand how their website is used as well as to provide a better service to users.

Concerning the international transfer of data to the U.S., the controller was using the Privacy Shield Certificate until the latter was declared invalid and subsequently the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the Commission, together with the appropriate complementary measures provided by Google. Additionally, eDreams did not have the option to opt-out from transferring data outside the EEA when using Google Analytics, since the configuration of the tool does not allow it.

The browsing and behavioral data of customers were pseudonymized by means of a cookie identifier ""Cookie ID"" that allowed eDreams to analyze how the user accessed and interacted with their website. The Cookie ID was also their internal identifier to analyze the results at a statistical level. The controller claimed that no processing of special categories of personal data took place as defined in Article 9 GDPR, nor any processing of personal data of particularly vulnerable persons. The data storage was 26 months, which allowed the controller to make comparisons with the previous year data.

On 12 October 2020, in response to the DPA’s requests, Google stated that customers using Google Analytics can enable IP anonymization immediately after the data is collected. When data collected through Google Analytics transferred by Google's customers are personal data, they would have to be pseudonymised (as mandated by Google Analytics Terms of Service). Also, Google highlighted that they obtained ISO 27001 certification and will allow customers or customer-appoint third-party auditor to conduct audits of Google Analytics and verify Google's compliance with its obligations.

Google also claimed that if any government request access to personal data stored in Google's systems in the course of an investigation, a dedicated team of Google lawyers and specially trained personnel will carefully review the request to verify that it is lawful, proportionate, and complies with Google's policies. Their infrastructure is not designed to, and does not, give the U.S. government or any other government ""backdoor"" access to customer data or its servers. In addition, they highlighted that it uses strong technical measures (such as encryption) to protect against interception, including surveillance attempts by government authorities around the world.

Despite all the arguments, on 26 July 2023, the DPA ordered eDreams to comply with Article 44 GDPR, specifically to adapt its data processing with Google Analytics to ensure no international data transfers to U.S. occur without adequate safeguards. The Spanish DPA determined the measures implemented by eDreams were insufficient to address the core issue of unlawful data transfers and the risk it posed to EU citizens' data protection rights.","1.

"On 31 August 2023 the data subject received a marketing message. As he was curious to know how the controller obtained his data, he sent him a data access request, to which the controller did not reply. Therefore, the data subject filed a complaint with the Slovenian DPA.

On 18 October 2023, the controller was requested by the DPA to take a written decision on the applicant's request in accordance with Article 12 GDPR and Article 15 GDPR.

On 3 November 2023, the data controller sent an email to the DPA, indicating that they responded to the request for access to personal data and removed the data subject from the customer database.

On 8 November 2023, the data subject informed that he received a response in which the controller apologized for the delayed response. However, the apology did not change the fact that the controller missed the legally prescribed deadline, thereby violating the law and committing an offense for which a fine is prescribed.

The controller stated the data subject had voluntarily subscribed to receive notifications on 19 June 2015. In connection with this, the applicant pointed out that there were changes in data protection legislation in recent years, and controllers were required to re-obtain consent for further use or delete data. Therefore, the data subject’s claimed that retaining the data for 8 years longer and starting using the same data after a period of 8 years was unlawful and unsolicited marketing communication.

The data subject insisted on reporting the violations, believing that the controller stored and used his data without a legal basis.","1. The case involves a covered entity (the controller) and an individual (the data subject) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

The controller, Wikimedia Foundation Inc, is the operator of Wikipedia.org.

The data subject requested the controller to erase all his data under Article 17 GDPR, because the data was inaccurate and not up to date. The registered films were not up to date and there were also errors with certain films, in which he was either not correctly listed or the films had incorrect titles.

The controller refused the erasure request based on two reasons. Firstly, the controller claimed that it did not fall under the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3 GDPR) as it was based exclusively in the USA and under US law, and thus the GDPR is not applicable. It also did not provide any goods or services to persons such as the data subject. Secondly, the data processing was lawful due to the legitimate interest of the public as the data subject is a public figure and the processing was carried out for journalistic purposes. Even if the GDPR was applicable, the controller claimed that the data subject would not be entitled to erasure because the media privilege would apply.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA (Datenschutzbehörde, DSB), claiming that data processed by the controller was not factually accurate or up to date. The principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) GDPR obliges the controller to ensure that the data is both factually correct and, if necessary, up to date.","1.

"On 13 October 2023, the data subject submitted a request for access and subsequent erasure of his personal data, as he feared a “major negative personal impact” in the form of defamation. The controller responded that it would not act on the data erasure request because (i) the data subject had given consent to the processing of this personal data in a prior agreement and (ii) the controller needed to retain the personal data due to an overriding public interest.

On 30 December 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”). On 23 February 2024, the APD asked the controller to clarify 3 points: firstly, the APD asked the controller on what exception they relied on to refuse to grant the data subject access to his personal data. The controller explained that it had not allowed access to the document as it could pose a possible threat to the privacy of others, partly because a file against the data subject was opened by the police in June 2023.

Secondly, the APD asked clarifications regarding the “prior agreement” the controller relied on to refuse the access and erasure requests. The controller responded that the data subject signed a privacy notice.

Thirdly, the APD asked additional information concerning the “substantial public interest” that the controller relied on. The controller explained that the data subject was accused of criminal offences in which the controller could contribute evidence for the benefit of the public interest.

In its responses, the controller also indicated that it was willing to give the data subject access to the file, and that it would make the necessary practical arrangements to this end.","1.

"Data subject one is an ambassador of a government and worked for the controller. Data subject two is married to data subject one.

The controller is an international organisation, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

The controller initiated an internal investigation against data subject one after a sexual harassment and discrimination complaint about them by a former employee of the controller. Data subject one argued the allegations were not true. During the internal investigation, Whatsapp and Telegram messages between the data subjects were disclosed, which did not reveal any harassing or discriminatory behaviour. The work phone of data subject one was also confiscated during the investigation without their consent.

As part of the investigation, a large amount of content of the first complainant's work mobile phone was extracted and analysed. Content that had already been deleted had also been restored. Although the employee's allegations had not been confirmed, data subject one had been informed that the extracted or deleted and restored photos contained both nudity and pornographic content and that therefore proceedings would be initiated against them for violation of the controller’s code of conduct.

The extracted data largely concerned the private and family life of data subject one. The health data of data subject one’s parents had also been revealed during the investigation. Therefore, data subject one requested the erasure of the unlawfully obtained data and to indicate which personal data had been obtained and which recipients the personal data was disclosed to.

The controller replied that it would not comply with the two requests due to its immunity.

The data subjects filed a complaint at the Austrian DPA (“Datenschutzbehörde”). The data subjects claimed there was a violation of their right to confidentiality as the controller analysed the work phone of data subject one on which (sensitive) personal data of the data subjects were stored. The data subjects argued that not only the professional data had been analysed, but also the private content, which had also been labelled as such. They argued there was no legal basis for this. The data subjects further argued that their right to access was violated, because they were not informed of the recipients who received their personal data. The data subjects further argued that their right to erasure was violated.","1.

On 7 February 2023, the data subject exercised his right of objection and withdrew his consent for the use of his personal images, claiming that on 30 March 2023, his images still appeared in the claimed company social media.

The controller argued that they attempted to address the request appropriately and that technical and communication issues with Meta (the company behind the social networks used) prevented the timely deletion of the image. Despite their efforts, including multiple attempts to contact and requests for assistance from META, the corporate account in question could not be recovered or modified in time.

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) dismissed the complaint because the data controller did respond to the data subject’s request, complying with the applicable deadlines stipulated by GDPR. It found that the completeness of the request depends on META’s return.

The data subject filed an appeal.

"A bank ('controller') used the data subject's personal data, including the content of payment transactions, to build models for their 'personalised discounts' service. The data subject objected to the use of his data to build models which offered the personalised discounts. The controller responded that his request was registered and that his data would no longer be used for model building. The data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA ('GBA') on 10 January 2020.

First, the  controller argued that it relied on consent for the activation of the personalised discounts service. However, to build the models on which the service is based, the controller invoked legitimate interest. It also explained that building these models constitutes further processing. Therefore, the controller distinguished between 'tailored information' which was based on the data subject's consent which he could withdraw and the 'model building', which was based on legitimate interest with the data subject's right to object.

Second, the controller argued that the data subject did not have an interest in the case as he never activated the personalised discounts service. The controller also explained that the data subject's right to objection was granted before the complaint was filed and thus, his personal data was no longer processed for the model building. The controller considered that this rendered the complaint inadmissible.

The data subject argued that the processing of personal data in data models was done for a completely different purpose than that for which the personal data was initially collected, namely the handling of transactions in the performance of the agreement between the controller and the data subject. The data subject also explained that the controller's privacy policy of 2 February 2017 stated that the controller used its customers' transaction data to better know and serve its customers for all marketing and commercial purposes as listed in the privacy policy. The controller updated its privacy policy on 1 February 2019 and it indicated that the transaction data was used to build analytical data models for commercial purposes.","1.

On 28 September 2021, the complainant inspected the complaint and the associated police file after being informed that the proceedings had been discontinued. The complainant discovered that the reporter knew their name at the time of filing the complaint. As a result, the data subject submitted a (data protection) complaint to the relevant data protection authority (DPA) on 23 October 2021. They alleged a violation of the right to secrecy under § 1 Datenschutzgesetz (Data Protection Act) (DSG) by the police officer involved in their case.

Following the dismissal, the complainant lodged a new data protection complaint against the police officer involved in a letter dated 09 October 2022. Upon the request of the DPA, the data subject provided a statement that they became aware of the violation of the right to secrecy in December 2021 based on subsequent inquiries.

On 06 February 2023, the complainant responded that there was no contradiction and provided an explanation. The data subject made further submissions on 28 March 2023, highlighting that their new complaint was not identical to the first complaint because the responsible person had changed. They argued that the concept of the ‘responsible person’ should be defined and interpreted broadly to allow complainants to make mistakes in identifying responsible individuals without invalidating their complaints. The data subject further reiterated that their second complaint was timely, and was proven. On 19 May 2023, the authorities rejected the complainant's data protection complaint filed on 09 October 2022. The authority argued that the complainant's request to address the data protection complaint had expired as the one-year limitation period from the date of knowledge of the adverse event had already lapsed, as stipulated in § 24(4) (DSG).

This app and website allowed patients to browse medical practices, identify themselves, choose the doctor with whom they want the appointment, choose the desired time slot and confirm the appointment.

The data subject considered this response insufficient and claimed that the administrator was indeed responsible for the processing.

"On 15.12.2022 the complainant proceeded to file a complaint against a Diagnostic centre. The complainant alleged that after conducting tests at the diagnostic centre, an employee of the diagnostic centre communicated the results of her tests to the complainant's father by telephone without her consent. Specifically, she alleged that an employee of the diagnostic center contacted her father by telephone, informed him of the additional tests that the complainant had to undergo and requested that the complainant call immediately to confirm the additional cost. In the complainant's protest, she claimed that the diagnostic center apologized and admitted the incident by saying ""what's done is done, now it's not undone.""

On 28.03.2023, the respondent diagnostic centre replied to the Authority as follows: it confirmed that the complainant had undergone examinations at the diagnostic centre, where the secretariat informed her about the data protection policy of the complainant and completed the form E3 entitled ""DECLARATION OF CONSENT FOR SENDING RESULTS"" for sending the results by electronic mail using the encryption method. Furthermore, according to the diagnostic center's allegations, the complainant herself provided her telephone number to the secretariat, which was registered in the system, and the secretariat called that telephone number in order to inform her of additional required tests. This call was answered by the complainant's father, who responded that the complainant was absent and who was asked to inform her that she needed to contact the diagnostic center for her personal matter and no health information was disclosed. Furthermore, with regard to the center's apology, the respondent claimed that there was no admission of the incident and apology, but rather the situation was handled with courtesy and the complainant was informed of the content of the disputed telephone call.

On 28.04.2023, the complainant responded to the allegations of the respondent and noted that she never stated the specific telephone number to the diagnostic centre and that her number is different and she stands by the allegations of her complaint. In response, the respondent clarifies that the complainant's father is not a client of the diagnostic centre and therefore it is impossible that he could have been called in error, insisting on the allegation that the specific telephone number was verbally stated by the complainant and entered into the diagnostic centre's system. At the same time, it submits that the complaint is unproven, unfounded and constitutes an attempt by the complainant to obtain a pecuniary advantage, which has submitted an extrajudicial statement to the company proposing an out-of-court settlement of the incident in return for compensation.","1.

"The data subject owned a flat and was a member of the co-owners’ association. Following multiple incidents, several co-owners requested the installation of a security system with cameras in the entrance hall and garage. In January 2018, a general meeting was held and the installation was unanimously approved, not including the abstention of some owners, including the data subject. In 2018, the cameras were installed, and sticker icons were placed to indicate that the building was surveilled. The data subject allegedly removed these stickers because they were bilingual and they claimed that this was not allowed. The data subject also allegedly cut several signal cables and threatened the installer of the cameras.

In July 2019, the data allegedly rendered one of the cameras unusable using an alcohol marker. Additionally, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (‘APD’) against the installer of the cameras and the representative of the co-owners’ association for installing the cameras without the data subject’s consent, and claiming that the images were kept in an unknown location for an unknown duration.

The aforementioned incident and the complaint made the representative disable the cameras. Therefore, since July 2019, the cameras had allegedly stopped filming. The representative also argued that the decision to install cameras was taken by a vote and not individually. Additionally, there was a 4-month appeal period against the decision. The data subject did not challenge the decision, which made it binding under Article 557-9 of the Belgian Civil Code.

"In August 2020, a data subject visited a news website, 24.hu (the controller), while being logged into their Facebook. The data subject observed that the controller processed her personal data (IP address and cookie settings) using a Facebook Connect cookie and transferred at least some of it to Facebook, Inc. (the processor) – i.e., to the United States (US). Represented by noyb, the European Centre for Digital Rights, the data subject filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA (NAIH) claiming that the controller unlawfully transferred her data to a third country.

The data subject argued that the transfer of personal data to the US was an unlawful breach of the GDPR given Schrems II, which invalidated the adequacy decision for data transfers between the EU-U.S. (Privacy Shield). In addition, the transfer could not be based on the standard data protection clauses set out in Article 46(2)(c) and (d) GDPR pursuant to Schrems I. Because the controller was thus unable to adequately guarantee the protection of the personal data transferred, the data subject argued, it should be legally obliged to stop the transfer of personal data to the United States. Nonetheless, almost 1 month after the Schrems II judgment, the controller had not taken any action to stop the transfer. The data subject requested a full investigation by the DPA pursuant to Article 58(1) GDPR, as well as a suspension of the transfer pursuant to Article 58(2)(d), (f) and (j) GDPR.

The NAIH launched an inquiry. It determined that the data subject’s IP address, unique user cookie and context of visit (URL) were processed by the processor. It also noted that the controller’s data processing terms and Privacy Shield Terms continued to refer to the EU-US Privacy Shield despite its invalidation. In addition, the privacy policy did not mention recipients of personal data processed by the controller.

In a reply brief submitted on 7 January 2021, the controller stated that it was not aware of personal data processed by external organizations like Facebook. The controller acknowledged that several cookies transferred data to the US, but that the Facebook Connect cookie in particular transferred data to Ireland rather than to a third country.  It claimed that consent was its legal basis for processing.","1.

"The data subject’s parents leased a property to a relative. Upon termination of the residential lease, a release of the rental deposit was agreed. The data subject was asked by a bank (‘controller’) to provide a copy of the identity cards of her parents, or for her parents to go to the bank in person for the purpose of identification.

The data subject refused to do so, arguing that neither the anti-money laundering legislation, nor the legislation on residential tenancy imposed such a requirement for the release of the rental deposit. Moreover, due to their health condition, her parents could not visit the controller in person.

The data subject still provided a copy of her parents’ identity card; expressly stating that this action did not imply her agreement with the requirement to present these documents.

"Mediahuis Ireland Group Limited (the controller) is a media organization publishing Irish news. A data subject filed a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) concerning a series of news reports in the three of the controller’s newspapers -- the Irish Independent, the Herald and the Sunday Independent – in which their medical data was processed.

The controller claimed that the right to freedom of expression and information for journalistic purposes permitted the processing. Pursuant to section 43 of the Data Protection Act 2018, the DPC initiated an inquiry into the balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to data protection. Under section 43 of the Data Protection Act, processing of personal data for the purpose of exercising the right to freedom of expression and information exempts a controller from complying with several GDPR provisions. This exemption is only applicable in circumstances where compliance with the provision would be incompatible with exercising the right to freedom of expression.

The DPC investigated the applicability of the exemption pursuant to the Section 43 balancing test, considering two things: first, whether the processing was for the purpose of exercising the right to freedom of expression and information; and second, whether compliance with the relevant GDPR provisions would be incompatible with those purposes.","1.

"A data subject filed a compliant within the Bulgarian DPA (CPDP), claiming his brother unlawfully processed personal data of him and his family via video surveillance installed on a property co-owned by data subject and his brother.

The property consisted of a three-level building and a yard. Data subject's brother owned the first and second floor of the building and 2/3 of the yard. The mother of brothers had a right to use the second floor and lived there. The third floor belonged to the data subject but it was his daughter who mostly lived there that time.

Three cameras were installed on property, covering only the image of the property, i.e.:

* access to the entrance of the house from inside, 
* a staircase leading to the first floor,
* the entrance the apartment of data subject's brother,
* a part of the yard and patio,
* a corridor which gave access to three rooms in the basement.

No camera covered the second and third floor of the building.

The cameras were connected with a recorder and a router. The recorded videos were stored locally for a period of 2-3 days and were automatically deleted after that period.  Data subject's brother and his wife were using a mobile app to monitor the area and preview recordings. Within the property, there were signs (stickers) warning about the CCTV.

During CPDP inspection, another camera located on the outer fence was discovered. According to data subject's brother it was installed by data subject. It was confirmed that camera was not working, since it was disconnected from electricity.

The proceedings confirmed data subject and his brother were in a private conflict. Data subject's brother explained he installed the video surveillance because of aggressive behaviour and committed acts of vandalism by data subject and his ex-wife. Hence, the data processing was based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.","1.

"A data subject requested access to and erasure of their personal data. A fear of a “major negative personal impact”, including possible defamation was indicated as a reason for the request to erase the data.

The data controller rejected the erasure request, because the data subject gave consent to the data processing and, afterwards, the controller needed to keep the data for an overriding public interest.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA).

During the examination proceedings, the controller argued that the decision to reject the erasure request was based on Article 10 (1)(1) and Article 10 (1)(3) of the Dutch Personal Data Protection Law (Wet betreffende de bescherming van natuurlijke personen met betrekking tot de verwerking van persoonsgegevens). This law authorized the controller to process the data contrary to data subject’s request, since the data subject would potentially be accused of criminal offences and the controller would be involved in the proceedings. Hence, as a party to the proceedings, the controller could provide the authority with necessary evidence.

In addition, the data controller explained that an overriding public interest referred to a type of potential proceedings.","1. The case involves a covered entity (the data controller) and an individual (the data subject) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

This information is then published on the Belgian Official Journal (Moniteur Belge - Belgisch Staatsblad) and on the website of the Court of Auditors of Belgium.

The controller, a private entity, collects these pieces of information and publishes them on its website. The main purpose of this website is promoting transparency in the public institutions and displaying people holding multiple offices in Belgium.

On 18 October 2021, the controller refused to erase the data, arguing that:

* the publication of this information on its website contributes to the transparency essential to the proper functioning of democracy with regard to the attribution of certain mandates, functions and professions;
* the information is available on the website of the Court of Auditors and of the Official Journal and its publication in these websites is compulsory by law.

"Complaint

On the 18 June 2018, the data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA against Radio Télévision Belge de la Communauté francaise (RTBF), the controller.

The data subject complained that the live services of the controller are only available in Belgium if an email, login via Facebook or Google account is provided. Further, if users deactivate cookies and tracking by third parties, the connection fails. The data subject set out that the service should be available without having to surrender personal data.

Initially, the controller argued that it is pursuing a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR in collecting the data.

Investigation by the Investigative Service (IS) of the Belgian DPA (APD)

The investigation found that the controller collected the following data: first and surname, password, email address, phone number, date of birth and gender identity.

To the investigation by the SI, the controller argued that the principle of impartiality under Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights had not been respected. The controller alleged that the language used in the report issued by the investigative service of the DPA strongly favoured the position of the data subject.

Furthermore, the controller stated that it did not have enough time to answer the questions posed by the DPA and that the DPA had denied to meet the controller in person. It argued that due to this time pressure, it had made a mistake regarding the legal basis of the processing. Therefore, the true legal basis for the processing was in fact Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The controller described that the TV service is a personalized service and that users are informed of this in the privacy policy. Therefore, creating an account for the service equates to a contractual relationship according to the controller and the data collected is necessary for the contract.","1.

The data was being used in a in an investigation following a disclosure on the Data Subjects’ possible mistreatment of child. 
Part of the investigation is interception by means of microphones found to be violation of Penal code (Straffeloven 263(2)). 
The illegal interception was forwarded to the Data Controller along with the disclosure for possible mistreatment of child by the third party.

Subsequently the third party chose to re-send the illegally collected data to the Data Controller [again].
The Data Controller later chose to change their original decision (to disregard the data) and use the illegal data.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Hellenic DPA  (Aρχή Προστασίας Δεδομένων Προσωπικού Χαρακτήρα-HDPA), alleging that the controller processed his personal data unlawfully  violated his right to object.

Specifically, he claimed that the controller obtained his criminal record without his consent, disclosed it to the board of directors, shared it with internal staff and a cooperating law firm, and made related information publicly available through a 'public administration decisions transparency platform' (ΔΙΑΥΓΕΙΑ).  The data subject further claimed that the  controller failed to respond adequately to his objection to the processing of his personal data.

The controller claimed that the processing of the data subject's personal data was lawful and necessary. It stated that the processing was carried out within the framework of competences of its internal management and legal obligations, plus, a confidential protocol was kept at all times. It had a legitimate interest in knowing his criminal record, since its relevant provisions of the rules of procedure provide that a Head of Projects is prohibited from having a felony conviction.","1.

"The dentist, Dr. Marini, required that patients fill out a medical history questionnaire before receiving dental services at his office. The questionnaire asked about previous, existing or suspected infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV). The complainant, a prospective patient, indicated that he was positive for an HIV infection. The dentist subsequently refused to give him dental treatment, claiming that the complainant’s HIV infection would prevent him from “averting a possible contagion of staff and other patients.”

Italian national law (Law of June 5 1990, n. 135) holds that specific precautions to prevent contagion should be taken for each individual patient, such that patients with HIV infections can access dental services. Meanwhile, Article 5 GDPR provides that personal data must be processed in a lawful and transparent manner, relevant and limited to what is necessary with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (the principles of ""lawfulness, fairness, transparency"" and “data minimization”). In combination, this means that patient history on infectious diseases can only be used to provide a better plan of medical treatment.","1.

"The Italian data protection rules in the field of health allows the creation of an ""Electronic Health Record"" related to the patient and including all the relevant information (e.g. visit details, medical interventions, clinical tests, etc). The health record is available online to the data subject and can be shared with medical professionals only upon explicit consent. Furthermore, the patient can ask for data masking, which guarantees that selected information can be seen only by the patient and the data controller.

In this case, a patient in Romagna asked for data masking regarding a medical intervention to have an abortion, but, due to a technical error, the software shared the information with the patient's general practitioner. This resulted in the disclosure of special categories of personal data without any suitable legal basis and in violation of an explicit request for obfuscation made by the data subject. The Local Health Authority of Romagna subsequently notified the DPA of a data breach, and the DPA started an investigation and found out that the same data sharing affected other 48 data subjects.","1.

"Deliveroo Italy is owned by the UK company Roofoods LTD, whose data center is located in Ireland. They are joint controllers of rider data. When the Garante started to investigate Deliveroo Italy, Roofoods clarified that Deliveroo Italy had 8,000 riders who use the Deliveroo rider app. Roofoods acquires personal and contract data, payment data, data relating to the vehicle used for deliveries, and determines how to process riders’ data. It claims that the rider booking system in Italy is based on availability during critical time slots and reliability of the rider (ie actual participation in the reserved shifts or cancellation prior to the start of the shift). The app also tracks the management of an order by a rider (from acceptance of the order to delivery) and tracks the location of the rider every twelve seconds.

After investigation, the Garante notified Deliveroo Italy and Roofoods that it had found violations of Articles 5(1)(a)(c)(e), 13, 22(3), 25, 30(1)(c)(f)(g), 32, 35, 37(7), and 88 of the GDPR.

In defensive briefs, UK Roofoods contended that it was going to review its data retention policies, that Deliveroo riders were sufficiently informed about the data processed on them, and that data collected on riders (such as geographical position) was necessary for the service. It also argued that statistics about the algorithms behind the booking system are available to riders on a dedicated page in the app, and that on Sunday each rider is informed about their access to booking times for the following week.","1.

"Following the receipt of several marketing SMS from a sender named Dorelan, the data subject tried to stop the unwanted activity by contacting what appeared to be the owner of the Dorelan brand, that is to say the company B&T Spa. The latter, however, claimed to have no involvement in the sending of the SMS and referred the data subject to another third party company, Aimon Srl. The data subject subsequently contacted Aimon in order to exercise their rights of access and objection. However, also Aimon denied any responsibility by claiming that the data subject's contact details had been obtained from other database suppliers.

During the investigation, the Italian DPA verified that B&T Spa had instructed Aimon to send promotional SMS to potential customers. The marketing company then made use of other suppliers who in turn had acquired the databases from third parties. In this succession of steps, based on the model of ""Chinese boxes"", it emerged that the data of the people contacted came from unverified, most likely unlawful collection activity. Just to name a couple, two data brokers had declared their offices in Florida and Switzerland. None of them had ever appointed their own representative in Italy or, to our knowledge, in any other Member State, in violation of Article 27 GDPR.","1.

"Clearview A.I. Inc. (Clearview) is a company conducting facial recognition on public web sources and is the data controller. Four data subjects had sought information from Clearview under Article 15 GDPR. Clearview replied to three of them and provided “special reports” containing the results obtained through the Clearview software. In 2021, these data subjects complained to the Italian DPA (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali) regarding the processing of their personal data by Clearview, without their consent. In addition, two ""organisations committed to defending the privacy and fundamental rights of individuals"" submitted information about precedents in Germany and Sweden, and their reports on activities of Clearview to the DPA. Based on the press reports on the activities of Clearview and the complaints submitted to it, the DPA opened an investigation.

Before the DPA, Clearview submitted as follows:

The GDPR was not applicable and the DPA lacked jurisdiction as Clearview was not offering its services in Italy and had utilized technical measures to block Italian IP addresses from accessing services of Clearview. Clearview was not carrying out any monitoring activity as per Article 3(2)(b) GDPR, and its search results were akin to Google Search. Clearview did not have a list of Italian customers, and its privacy policy did not refer to GDPR. Clearview did not have a representative in the Union as mandated by Article 27 GDPR. Accordingly, the activities of Clearview were not covered by the GDPR.

Since 2019, law enforcement agencies in the United States (US) were using Clearview, “especially in the context of child pornography investigations”. This generated international interest and several European government agencies signed up for a test account for a short time.

In March 2020, following complaints by regulators in European Union (EU), these test accounts, which were very few, were closed.

Clearview does not have any customers in the EU, and it ensures the same through “specific setting that prevents access to the software via European IP addresses.”

Clearview’s technology is used by law enforcement agencies and assists them in identifying criminals. As per Clearview’s terms, it is the responsibility of its customers to “verify that the use of this product is legitimate in light of the local regulations applicable to it.”

Clearview contractually requires its users to conduct further investigations and independently corroborate information collected using Clearview.

Clearview is based in the US and has no branch in the EU. It neither offers its services in the EU nor monitors behaviour.

Clearview did expand to Canada but ceased all its activities in Canada following the proceedings initiated by the Canadian Privacy Commissioners. This expansion cannot be considered to demonstrate its intention of entering the Italian market.

Journalistic sources cannot be relied upon as they are speculative.

The Swedish decision was concerning the above test accounts that existed for a short period and were available to Swedish police forces.

Clearview did not conduct any behavioural analysis or use any profiling techniques. Collection of data, even of significant volume, does not automatically constitute profiling.

The Data Controller is Clearview’s customer (i.e. police forces) and not Clearview itself, and this was held by the Swedish authority.

Clearview “does not collect or provide any information about the location, browser history, business activity or behaviour of the natural person who appears as a search result and does not imply any behavioural, predictive or analytical modeling. The information that can be obtained about an individual using Clearview's search engine is less meaningful than the information that can be obtained from a Google Search based on that individual's name, and no one is claiming that a Google browser search constitutes behavioral monitoring.”

Clearview is compliant with US law and it is impossible to take into account all existing laws in a globalized world. “Moreover, since Google's search engine is presumed to comply with European laws because Google is established in the EU and offers its services to users in the EU, if the Regulation were also found to apply to Clearview, the processing of the complainant's data should be considered lawful”.

Clearview voluntarily complies with requests for access from European residents, even though it is not bound to do so.","1. The case involves a covered entity (Clearview) and an individual (data subjects) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

"This case was initiated by a data breach notification reported by the Tuscany Region authorities to the Italian DPA (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali – Garante) on 30 July 2020. The breach involved the accidental disclosure of personal data belonging to approximately 3500  candidates participating in a public recruitment competition for administrative assistant job positions.

The Tuscany Region carrying out the contest (the data controller in this case) had a processing agreement with IT company Scanshare S.r.l. for the provision of services related to the organisation and management of the pre-selection phase. The IT company was tasked with processing the data necessary for the completion of the recruitment tests, as well as uploading these on to a server that would host the web page in which each candidate could consult their individual scores.

An email was sent by the processor to a candidate asking for information regarding the publication of the results, which mistakenly contained a link to the web application which was uploading the personal data related to the candidates and their scores, instead of the website where each candidate could log on to obtain their individual results.

The mistakenly sent link to the web application which contained the upload of the entire data set was subsequently circulated among other candidates. From this link, it was possible to access and download, inter alia, the name, surname, date of birth, tax code, detailed results of questionnaires, as well as the overall scores of all the participants. This data was exposed for approximately one hour until the data breach was discovered and remedied. The processor, without consulting the controller, then proceeded to subcontract an IT company named Hostinger, in order to provide it with the logs of the IP addresses which had unauthorised access to the data.

During the Garante’s investigation procedures, the processor claimed that this data breach was not of a malicious nature, and was instead due to a mistake by an employee, due to the fact that the link to website for the candidates, and the one to the web app for the upload of the entire data set, had the same name. It also stated the Hostinger, the third party they had subcontracted to investigate the data breach, in the end was not able to communicate the requested logs, and had no access whatsoever to the personal data and test scores contained on their servers, and hence should not be considered a sub-processor.","1.

"The company 'aiComply Srl' (the ‘Processor’) provided the Airport of Bologna (the ‘Controller’) with the whistleblowing application “WB confidential” for the organizational acquisition and management of reports on illegal conduct by its employees and other stakeholders. The processor further offered maintenance of the application through two other companies, ‘Agic Technology Srl’ carrying specialist assistance activities and ‘A1Tech Srl’ carrying out the management of the IT-infrastructure.

Investigations of the DPA found, that personal data transferred and stored within the application was not encrypted. Furthermore, it was verified that all three processing companies shared a non-nominal “System-Administrator” profile for the application. In this regard, aiComply had never informed the airport about this relationship with the two sub-processors.

aiComply argued, that suitable security measures and especially encryption, had not be considered due to an extraordinarily limited amount of processing relating to only few reports transmitted through the system. Accordingly, the application was sufficiently protected by a firewall and an only internal or VPN access. It was negotiated with the airport that no further security measures shall be adopted. The processor also argued, that both involved companies for the maintenance did not process any personal data due to carrying out only technical activities and were generally appointed as suppliers of system administration tasks by aiComply.","1.

"The GPDP launched an investigation into the parking meters operated by the Municipality of Rome. According to a report, users had to enter the license plate of their vehicle to obtain the parking ticket.

It found some parking meters under management had recently been modernised to allow card payments and the personalisation of payments to stop users of the service from needing to display tickets. The latter required users to enter their license plates into the meters. The system underpinning this was operated by Atac s.p.a. The company collected information (e.g. the time, the start and end date of the stop, the amount paid and the license plate) relating to the payment of the parking, which was facilitated by more intermediary companies, and made it available both to traffic auxiliaries for the purposes of verifying the payment of the parking as well as to the company's internal staff for administrative management purposes.

The DPA notified Roma Capitale that it had discovered some breaches and invited the municipality to produce defensive writings. It stated that the municipality had effectively put in place a system that (1) processed the personal data collected through the new parking meters installed in the area (2) without providing data subjects adequate information, (3) without defining the roles of the external companies involved in the processing, (4) without defining the storage times of the data collected and (5) without having adopted appropriate security measures, in violation of Articles 5, 12, 13, 25, 28 and 32 GDPR.","1.

"The Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali, Italy’s DPA, led an investigation into Vodafone Italy S.p.A following various complaints by Vodafone users and non-users, which highlighted multiple issues on the phone company’s practices.

The first group of claimants complained about constant unwanted promotional phone calls and SMS from Vodafone, with one example being a person claiming that they have been receiving at least 4/5 messages a month by Vodafone since 2018, even after he communicated to the company that he no longer wanted to receive such messages. Vodafone blamed this last mishap on a “system error” that failed to register the client’s request to stop the promotional messages.

The second set of complaints concerned the way that the company stored their client’s data. More specifically, costumers complained about being approached by Vodafone operators, usually after reporting issues with their internet service. However, it turned out that those were call-centres that worked for other phone companies or third party callers that used Vodafone’s logo in their WhatsApp profile. These unauthorized individuals would often ask about the issues the users reported, point out that Vodafone would increase their costumer service fees and offer to subscribe the user to a different phone provider. Other times, they would just request for the user’s IDs, possibly for fraudulent or phishing purposes. Vodafone claimed to have been aware of these practices in the past, confirmed that those were indeed unauthorized parties under false pretences, and explained that they were trying to improve security on their databases by applying 2 Factor Authentication.

Lastly, several users complained that Vodafone was not responding appropriately to their requests in exercise of their rights under Articles 15-22 GDPR. For example, one user complained that Vodafone had not replied at all to a request sent to them via email. Another one explained that Vodafone did reply, but did not promptly correct the user’s personal information as requested, therefore breaching Article 16 GDPR. A last user complained that Vodafone refused to provide the client with information about the purposes of processing his personal data under Article 15(1) because he did not provide them with appropriate Identification, as he used a document with a digital signature.","1.

"The case involves the processing of citizens’ health data by Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale Toscana Sud Est (hereafter simply ‘USL’), a local public health body, as part of a broader initiative from Tuscany Region related to the monitoring of chronic diseases in the population.

In the context of the above-mentioned public health approach, health data was shared among several public healthcare stakeholders, including general practitioners (GPs) and public clinics, coordinated by the USL. Initially, GPs sent to the USL only aggregated data pertaining to specific diseases. Until 2018, however, the USL asked GPs to fill in an Excel file with the names of the patients and their pathologies. After having gathered patients’ consent, GPs filled in the file, embedded it in a password-protected zip archive, and shared it with ‘district physicians’ via a USB drive stick. The file was then copied on the district physician’s PC and sent via email to a district physician who is competent for the whole area, who eventually sent it via the same mean to an administrative body named ‘ESTAR’. ESTAR is a data processor which manages a ‘data warehouse’ and makes data form the program available to the USL, for monitoring purposes, via a ‘data mart’.

After her discharge, a tried to contact her in order to give her information about a treatment, but used a different phone number found on the front page of the patient’s medical record, and hence found herself talking to her husband. The information disclosed to the patient's husband only concerned the type of ward to which the patient was admitted.

During the DPA’s investigation, the provider disclosed that the nurse had been formally authorised to process personal data, and she was provided with operating instructions to properly process personal data. Additionally, the USL presented that the procedure to record the health data of the patient was not computerised. Hence, although the form signed by the data subject and containing her refusal to provide information about her health to third parties was included in the medical record, the medical record itself showed on the front page a telephone number that the patient had given to the provider before her hospitalization.

Concerning the data breach itself, the USL reported that the nurse should have communicated with the patient in person at the hospital, right after her release, but she was interrupted by a call from another patient and hence asked the data subject to wait.

"On 27 December 2019, the UK Cabinet Office (department of the Government of the United Kingdom) published the content page of the New Years 2020 Honours List on its website. The content page contained a link to a CSV file version of the Honours list that was not adequately edited to remove personal data. The CSV file contained the postal address of Honours recipients in a column that had been “hidden” rather than completely “deleted” from the CSV file. Despite the various steps taken before publishing the CSV file, no one within the Cabinet Office teams working on the Honours List noticed that the column was only “hidden”. The column was still there and became apparent again once the CSV file was made available online on gov.uk.

The Cabinet Office was alerted of the data breach by a member of the Government Communications Team. The Cabinet Office then republished the content page without the link to the CSV file. However, anyone who had the exact URL to the CSV file already could still access it despite this change. This is because documents cannot be removed from the gov.uk website once they have been published.

The issue was escalated and eventually the CSV file was permanently deleted around 2 hours and 30 minutes after it was first made available. It was found that the CSV file was accessed 3872 times from 2798 IP addresses.

The Cabinet Office alerted affected data subjects within 48 hours of the data breach and submitted a Personal Data Breach Report to the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.

The Cabinet Office confirmed there was no written process in place to approve documents containing personal data prior to being published to ensure the content was suitably redacted. Additionally, the Cabinet Office’s page for best practice on data handling had not been updated for six months despite the implementation of a new software used to produce the Honours List (which contained a column for addresses).

"Royal Mail is the British postal service and is the data controller. On 29 April 2021, Royal Mail submitted a written breach report to the UK DPA (ICO) that due to a technical error, its marketing actions might have sent emails to “215,202 parties who had expressed a desire to no longer receive marketing from [Royal Mail]”.

Royal Mail explained that it had a list of 245,850 potential recipients, out of which “30,648 had provided valid and existing consent to receive the direct marketing messages, with 215,202 being deemed to have opted out.” On 20 April 2021, at the time of transmission of the marketing email, Royal Mail had sent the email to 30,648 persons while putting 215,202 in a holding step of the campaign.  However, on 27 April 2021, “due to an internal routing error, the 215,202 individuals who had been moved to the “holding step” were accidentally sent a “reminder email” which had been intended only for the 30,648 individuals who had been sent, but had not opened or engaged with, the initial email on 20 April 2021.”

The ICO opened an investigation and sought details about the volume of messages and an explanation of the routing error. Before the ICO, Royal Mail submitted the following:

It uses an automated system called Eloqua to send marketing emails. Royal Mail maintains a single master database of all individuals, i.e. those who have provided their consent to receive marketing emails and also those who have not consented to receive marketing emails. The single database is maintained to keep it updated as per the latest status of consent.

In a campaign, marketing emails are sent by Eloqua to those who have provided their consent. Individuals who have not given their consent are put at the end of the campaign, and the stage of sending them emails is bypassed. A reminder email is sent to persons who have given their consent but have not interacted with the original email.

In the present instance, 215,202 customers who were sent the reminder marketing email fell into two groups, “One group was made up of 91,736 customers who were registered with Royal Mail. This group had previously been presented with Royal Mail’s Fair Processing Notice at the point of registering, and subsequently opted out of marketing emails. The second group comprising the remaining 123,466 individuals were customers who had not registered for a Royal Mail account and had, at the time of using a Royal Mail service, checked out as a ‘guest’. These individuals were not asked about their marketing preferences and had not provided consent to receive future direct marketing.”

At the stage of sending reminder emails, details of persons who had not given their consent were fed to Eloqua due to a human error. Accordingly, persons who had not given their consent received the reminder email, even as they were not sent the original email. However, of “the 215,202 messages sent, the number delivered was “no more than 213,191”.”

Since the incident, Royal Mail has introduced several checks to minimize the risk of potential recurrence.

Royal Mail received six responses/complaints from subscribers who had received the unsolicited marketing email, in reply to which it apologized.","1. The case involves a covered entity (Royal Mail) and individuals (215,202 parties) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

"The Money Hive Limited (TMHL) is a company that calls itself ""a short term loan lender and broker for other lenders and financial service providers"". Mobile UK is an entity representing the interests of mobile subscribers in the UK. Mobile UK has a Spam Reporting Service, and subscribers can report a spam message by forwarding the spam message to Mobile UK.

In September 2020, numerous unsolicited text messages by Money Hive were reported. The Investigating Officer ascertained nine separate message scripts promoting high-interest payday loans. The messages contained links to websites operated by TMHL and were sent to people who had “previously applied online for a loan with a TMHL-operated website” but had left the process midway to due to any reason.

In response to the ICO’s letter seeking information and documentation about consent provided by the subscribers, TMHL stated the following:

•	It had used the services of two platform providers to send the messages.

•	Between 1 January 2020 to 8 September 2020, a total of 752,425 text messages were received by subscribers.

•	TMHL divided consent into two categories: “a) Individuals consent to being notified of their loan application results via SMS; and b) individuals consent to future marketing from it and ""select 3rd parties"" via separate tick boxes.” It added that ""a very small number of customers might not realise that the messages are direct responses to their loan application and consider them to be marketing texts"".

The ICO considered the 'customer journey' documents provided by TMHL and noticed two opt-in statements. Opt-in 1 was accessible after a customer had clicked 'apply now' on the respective website and had entered their contact details. It had the following text, followed by three separate optional tick boxes for email/SMS/phone:

""LoanPig and our 3rd party partners would like to stay in touch with you via email and sms to send you reminders and occasional relevant offers, please tick below if you wish to receive this[. .. ]""

Opt-in 2 had three checkboxes in which the first two checkboxes relating to subscribers being “contacted by SMS, email or telephone by Loanpig (TMHL) and its ""third party partners""” and their agreement to Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy were mandatory.

TMHL’s Privacy Policy stated that if a customer’s application “""does not meet [TMHL's] underwriting criteria, we may pass your details to a broker who may be able to offer you a loan or financial service from their panel of lenders and financial service providers""”. It also provided a list of brokers and further stated, “""[a]s part of the application process some lenders and financial service partners may take up to 24 hrs to respond by sms, email, or phone, so you may receive product offers from them within that period [... ]. To provide the best service possible during your application, we may send you, by sms or email, relevant alternative or complimentary products within the 24h application period"".”

The ICO noticed that many of the brokers listed in TMHL’s Privacy Policy were in the business of lead generation services/affiliate network services.

Before the ICO, TMHL gave evidence of subscribers having opted out of its messaging texts. It also explained the working of its messaging system and the number of messages being sent. On the aspect of messages containing links to third parties, TMHL stated that “they use alternative brokers to obtain a loan for their customers stating: ""[t]his isn't promoting 3rd party websites and we are only paid a commission when the customer gets a loan, not for each lead sent for example so we consider this the same as sending a customer to an alternative lender's website where they may obtain a loan. To confirm, we do not receive any commission if the consumer does not apply online or find a product, so this is not marketing"".” In addition, TMHL submitted to the ICO a “'Legitimate Interest Assessment' document in relation to these messages, which explained that their purpose was to provide an alternative short-term loan [through an alternative broker] when the individual's application to TMHL directly was unsuccessful.”

TMHL informed the ICO that they had started sending these messages from 12 March 2020. TMHL stated that it conducted regular due diligence, but it was on a face to face basis and there was no documentary record of the same.","1.

"Tuckers Solicitors (Tuckers) is a limited liability partnership of solicitors and is the data controller. On 24 August 2020, Tuckers became aware that its systems were hit by a ransomware attack.

It notified the same to the UK DPA (ICO) on the same day and stated, “attack had resulted in the encryption of civil and criminal legal case bundles stored on an archive server. Backups were also encrypted by the attacker”. In total, “972,191 individual files were encrypted. Of these, 24,711 related to court bundles. Of the 24,711 court bundles, 60 were exfiltrated by the attacker” and published on the dark web. As per Tuckers, “the bundles included a comprehensive set of personal data, including medical files, witness statements, name and addresses of witnesses and victims, and the alleged crimes of the individuals.”

Tuckers notified 53 parties (out of the 60) whose bundles were released, as per Article 34 GDPR.

On 27 August 2020, Tuckers appointed a third-party investigator to provide a 'Cyber Security Incident Response Report'. The investigators could not find the source of the attack but found “evidence of a known system vulnerability” that could have been used to access Tucker’s networks and exploit them. Subsequently, the investigators released a patch, which Tucker incorporated in its systems in June 2020.

ICO investigators found BA ought to have identified weaknesses in its security and resolved them with security measures that were available at the time.

This included names, addresses, payment card numbers and CVV numbers of 244,000 BA customers.

After the app was published on 18 June 2020, the DPA became aware that, in order to be able to use the digital gift card, the users of the application had to submit their personal data, such as, email address, phone number, age and gender. Moreover, the users were also required in some cases to give an access to their phones´ camera, microphone, GPS location, calendar, contact information as well as data on USB storage.

The DPA decided to open an investigation to assess whether the collection of users´ data and the acquisition of access rights to their mobile devices by the digital gift card application were in compliance with the GDPR and the Icelandic Act no. 90/2018 on data protection and the processing of personal data.

"Since 2015, the Icelandic health authorities had appointed Landspítali Hospital (the Hospital) to conduct border and domestic screening to monitor the spread of infectious diseases. It was agreed that the Hospital was allowed to subcontract services in order to carry out this screening. In June 2020, the Hospital sought the services of a company named Icelandic Genealogy (IG) to conduct COVID-19 screening tests. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was carried out by the Icelandic Medical Director of Health (the Director) in consultation with the Icelandic DPA. The DPA observed that there was no indication that this processing would violate the GDPR. As a result, the Hospital outsourced part of the testing and screening activities to IG.

However, in August 2020, the Hospital publicly announced that they would temporarily relocate part of their own staff to IG’s facilities to use some of their equipment and software (Virlab) in order to increase their screening capacity. Following this announcement, the Icelandic DPA asked the Hospital for specific information regarding security measures related to the processing of personal data, and whether a new DPIA had been carried out by the Hospital before relocating part of their staff to IG’s facilities.

The Hospital disregarded this request, and related part of its staff to IG’s facilities, as planned. The DPA reiterated their request in September 2020. The Hospital then responded to the DPA, apologising for the delay, and explaining that they had began using IG’s facilities expeditiously in order to respond to the increased demand in sampling due to the pandemic.

The Hospital also stated that they had not conducted a new DPIA because they considered that the previous DPIA applied to the processing that would now temporarily take place at IG’s facilities. However, prior to the transfer of some staff members to IG’s facilities, IG only had access to sample numbers sent by the Hospital. Once part of the Hospital's staff started working in IG’s facilities and using their equipment, the IG’s Virlab system registered the names of individuals who had tested positive in border screening, as well as identification codes from samples taken at health centres which could be traced back to the individuals concerned. IG’s staff did not have access to this personal data as registered in the Virlab system, except for three employees involved in its design, programming and making necessary updates.

In November 2020, the DPA began an investigation, auditing the Hospital and IG in order to determine whether the new processing operations conducted by the Hospital's staff at IG’s facilities was compliant with the GDPR.","1.

"The lawyer of the company acting as data controller, Húsasmiðjan, contacted the Icelandic DPA (Persónuvernd) with regards to the installation of a fingerprint scanner system for the company's employees. The controller announced the DPA that it is using the system, and asked for the DPA's opinion on the legality of the processing operation.

The company had used the fingerprint scanner system for the logging in and out of employees in the company's payroll system. When an employee arrived at work they would have to scan their fingerprint, which created a number sequence with a timestamp that was linked to other information on the employee.

The image of the fingerprint itself was not stored and could not be retrieved from the number sequence stored in the system. In this aspect, the number sequence works similarly to an employee's ID number, and is not personally identifiable except for when the system performs the identity verification. Furthermore, encryption (256bit AES) was also used to make it difficult to reverse the process and identify individuals through the raw fingerprint image.","1.

"The Polish DPA (The Office for Personal Data Protection) received a complaint from an individual about irregularities in the processing of his personal data by a Bank, consisting in the transfer of the Complainant's personal data - without his consent - to a brokerage house. In order to determine the facts of the case initiated by the complaint, the Office for the Personal Data Protection, on three occasions, summoned the brokerage house to respond to the complaint and to provide explanations. Specifically, it asked the brokerage house about whether it processed the Complainant's data, on what legal basis, and for what purpose. It also asked how the brokerage house sourced the Complainant's data, whether the Complainant objected to processing, and if so, how the brokerage house responded.

The brokerage house claims that it did not receive a summons containing the questions. However, a copy of the summons was twice sent and served to the brokerage house at the address disclosed in the official register. Therefore, the summons sent to the brokerage house were deemed delivered. As a consequence of the failure of the brokerage house to respond to the correspondence addressed to it, the DPA was not able to obtain the information necessary to examine the case. The initiation of proceedings to impose an administrative fine on the brokerage house did not change the situation either, because the brokerage house claims that it did not receive the letter initiating such proceedings either.

"The controller, Fortum Marketing and Sales Polska S.A.

Within the scope of its business activity, Fortum cooperates with the processor PIKA Spółka z o.o. (""PIKA""). PIKA provides Fortum with archive services, including digital archives. The parties are bound by a Data Processing Entrustment Agreement from 2018 and a Storage (Document Archive) Agreement with associated services from 2016.

Fortum notified the Polish DPA of a personal data protection breach. According to them, the data of 137,314 customers had been copied. The breach of confidentiality concerned a newly created database containing information on Fortum's customers as follows: name and surname, residential or residence address, PESEL number, type, series and number of an identity document, e-mail address, telephone number, number and address of access point and contract data (e.g. date and number of contract, type of fuel, meter number).

Fortum did not notify the data subjects of a data breach because, in its assessment, there was no high risk of a breach of the rights or freedoms of natural persons. Fortum presented the analysis results that finally established the number of persons to be notified of a personal data breach due to a high risk of infringement of rights or freedoms of natural persons. The explanations indicated that the data of 120,428 persons had been exposed, of which 95,711 persons should have been notified of the breach. The remaining numbers were business customers and deceased persons.

Findings made in the course of the proceedings indicated that PIKA, as a processor to which Fortum had entrusted the processing of personal data of the persons affected by the breach, was also involved in the data breach. PIKA explained that, in case of changes to the systems, the individual departments of its IT division are required to record any changes made to the systems in their internal project management support and control systems. However, when making changes to the system, actual personal data of the Controller's customers were used. The effectiveness of the security features applied was not verified before the changes to the system were submitted to Fortum to resolve the performance issue. The security functions were not tested during the works carried out. In 2020, the Polish DPA notified PIKA of its recognition as a party to the proceedings.","1.

"In May 2020 Warsaw University of Technology (the controller) notified the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection of a data breach. The breach notification indicated that an unknown and unauthorised person downloaded from the University's IT network resources a database containing personal data of students and lecturers of studies from 2008 to 2020, as well as 169 candidates for studies for the academic year 2019/2020 (a total of 5013 persons).

The categories of data affected by the breach include: first and last name, parents' first names, date of birth, home or residence address, PESEL number, email address, username and/or password, mother's family name, ID card series and number, and telephone number.

The President of the Office for Personal Data Protection has notified the controller of the initiation of administrative proceedings concerning the possibility that the University, as a data controller, has breached its obligations under the GDPR.

In the course of the proceedings, the organisational unit of the University, in order to fulfil its tasks, uses an IT system, within which there is an application (for approximately 10 years) used by students to register for courses and to obtain access to their study history and fee settlements, as well as to prepare certificates, statistics and other documents required by the University. Within this system, lecturers were able to upload files related to the subject they were teaching.

The application was created from scratch by the University's employees, as none of the solutions offered on the market was able to meet the required needs.

There was a second application running in parallel, and both of them used access to the database that contained the personal data subject to the breach.

When analysing the notifications of breaches, the DPA pointed to a significant lapse of time from the date of occurrence of an event causing a personal data protection breach to the date of its discovery by the Company and, consequently, notification of the breach to data subjects and the President of the DPA. The notifications made by the Company in the analysed period of June 2020 included events causing personal data protection breaches from February and January 2020, and even events from 2019.

The Company indicated that it clarifies the cases of violations with the carrier on an ongoing basis in order to eliminate the problem of delays in providing information on data loss. The Company additionally explained that the period of the ongoing pandemic had a significant impact on the timeliness of notifications of personal data protection violations concerning the proceedings in question in terms of verification of the correctness of handling the return document process. According to the explanations of the Company, due to the limitations of courier companies related to the period of the pandemic, the process of verification and handling of return documents was prolonged, hence the information about the events was reported by the carrier with a delay. The Company emphasized that, in its opinion, the actions it undertakes bring effects in the long run, because the percentage of personal data protection violations in relation to the volume of all deliveries is small and it presented calculations for the month of June in that respect.

"The data subjects are customers at Bank Millennium S.A. (hereafter: controller). They provided the controller with their personal data in March 2019 to have a bank account set up. In May 2019, the controller notified them of the loss of their personal data. However, since the data subjects did not obtain additional information on the breach, in June 2019 they filed a complaint with the UODO (Polish DPA). During the DPA’s investigation, it turned out that, in April 2019, the controller sent a parcel to its Head Office, with several documents. These documents contained, in particular, the following data: name, surname, PESEL, registered address, bank account numbers, CIF number (identification number assigned to the controller's clients) of the Applicant and the Applicant's name, surname and PESEL.

The controller considered the circumstances of the breach, i.e., what personal data had been lost, and assessed this breach in accordance with a methodology based on the European ENISA methodology (a risk management assessment tool by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity). Based on this assessment, the controller considered that the breach is likely to (only) cause a medium risk of violation of the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Hence, it did not notify the data subjects in accordance with Article 34(1) GDPR, only supplying very general information on the nature of the breach, and that the data subjects could use the controller’s free Alert service to minimise the negative effects. Moreover, the controller also did not notify the DPA in accordance with Article 33(1) GDPR.

During the DPA’s investigation, the controller brought forward a number of arguments why it had not notified the data subjects and the DPA, i.e., that parcels are also categorized as ‘lost’ without leaving the supplier’s infrastructure, that the loss of PESEL numbers does not cause a high risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and that the data subject’s personal data was not actually used in an unauthorised manner. Also, regarding the assessment, the controller stated that it considered elements such as (1) the context of data processing (what type of data has been disclosed), (2) ease of identification (how easily are data subjects identified through this personal data), and (3) the circumstances of the breach (what was the security and confidentiality of the data).","1.

"Polish DPA received a letter from the State District Sanitary Inspector in Gniezno informing about the public disclosure of the list containing the addresses of residence of the persons who are in quarantine, which was ordered by an administrative decision and the mandatory quarantine in connection with the crossing of the country border, as well as the address data of persons undergoing home isolation in connection with a confirmed infection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the course of the proceedings, Polish DPA established that unauthorized disclosure of data took place in a waste management company.

An employee of the company, responsible for supervising the printed list of addresses of people in quarantine, left it for a short time without proper supervision. At that time, there was also another employee of the company in the room - a driver, who, taking advantage of the fact that the person responsible for supervising the printed list was directed back to him, copied (recorded as a photo) the list. The driver was to be informed by the person supervising the printed list whether, as part of his or her work, waste is to be collected from the places on the above mentioned list. The driver then made this photo available to at least one person.

The Polish DPA took steps to clarify the situation. It called the controller to clarify whether, in determining the procedures related to the processing of personal data concerning the addresses of persons under quarantine in connection with the coronavirus threat, it has carried out an analysis of the method of distribution of the above mentioned data in electronic and paper versions in terms of threats related to the loss of their confidentiality and to inform what the result of this analysis was.

In the submitted explanations, the company stated, that it carried out the analysis taking into account the circumstances related to the processors' failure to comply with the procedures in force in the company and the circumstances related to the stealing or removal of data. Moreover, the controller expressed the opinion that the lists received included only administrative (police) addresses, did not include first names, surnames and other data allowing to identify the natural person.","1.

"In May 2020, the authority was notified of a personal data breach. It consisted in sending by e-mail, by an insurance agent, who is an entity processing for an insurance company, an insurance policy containing personal data to an unauthorised addressee. In this way, the confidentiality of data of two persons was violated in the scope of names, surnames, residential or correspondence addresses, PESEL (national identification numbers), telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and information concerning the subject of insurance (passenger car), the scope of insurance, payments, assignments, as well as additional provisions resulting from the agreement. The supervisory authority has been informed about a personal data protection breach by an unauthorised addressee who has come into possession of documents not intended for him/her containing the aforementioned personal data.

PUODO conducted an investigation and received information from the insurer that a personal data protection breach consisting in providing personal data to an unauthorised recipient actually took place. The company indicated that an assessment was made with regard to the risk of violation of rights and freedoms of natural persons. On the basis of the assessment, the Company concluded that there was no breach resulting in the need to notify the President of UODO, because:

1. the customer provided an incorrect e-mail address to which the insurance policy document was sent, 2. the unauthorised recipient has informed the Company, so it can be concluded that he was aware of the regulations and importance of the information he received.

The Company accepted that there is no high probability of negative consequences for the data subjects through unauthorised use of their data and indicated the applied corrective measure in the form of a request to the unauthorised recipient to permanently delete the message together with a request for feedback confirming its deletion.

The authority has indicated to the Company that the fact that the infringement occurred as a result of an error of the customer who provided the agent with an incorrect e-mail address cannot affect the assessment of the event and its classification as a personal data protection violation. It results in making personal data available to an unauthorised person, which means that data confidentiality has been breached. What is more, due to the fact that the indicated data confidentiality violation concerns PESEL numbers together with names and surnames, residential addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, it should be considered that it may involve a high risk of violation of rights or freedoms of natural persons. At the same time, the President of UODO has again called upon the Company to carry out an analysis of the risk of infringement of rights and freedoms of natural persons necessary to assess whether there has been a breach of data protection resulting in the necessity to notify the President of the UODO and the persons affected by the breach.

However, the Company has upheld its argumentation and previous risk assessment. In the absence of notification of a personal data breach to the PUODO and the lack of notification of a personal data breach to the persons affected by the breach, the authority initiated administrative proceedings.","1.

In December 2018 the Company reported another infringement consisting in gaining unauthorised access to the Company's employee account. The employees of UODO conducted an inspection in the Company.

The access to the Company's employee panel and to the data of all the Company's clients from the Company's database system resulted in the materialisation of the risk of infringement of rights and the freedom of natural persons whose data are processed by the Company in the form of the application of the method called phishing, which is aimed at extracting data, e.g. credentials to a bank account by impersonating the Company in SMS messages and using the fact of making an order by the customer.","1.

"In September 2021, the Hungarian DPA initiated an ex officio investigation against Budapest Bank Zrt. (hereinafter the Bank) related to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software applied to the audio recordings of customer service telephone conversations between May 2018 and the start of the investigation.

According to the Bank, the software used speech signal processing based on AI to identify periods of silence, different voices talking at the same time, key words, and emotional elements (such as voice speed, volume and pitch) within the recorded sound files in order to identify customer dissatisfaction. Once the software had made an automated decision to identify calls according to these criteria, a Bank employee then listened to the recordings, and made call-backs to customers in order to handle and attempt to resolve any customer dissatisfaction issues.

The Bank stated that its legal basis for this processing was based on legitimate interest, and its purpose was to conduct call quality control, to prevent complaints and customer churn, as well as to increase efficiency.

The Bank stated that customers were informed at the beginning of the calls that they were being recorded, but admitted that they did not inform them that the AI software would be used to analyse the calls, since detailed information in this regard would make the introduction to the calls too long, outlasting many of the simple queries made by customers when calling the Bank. The Bank also claimed that the system did not store any identifiable personal data, or perform automated decision-making in order to create personal profiles.

Additionally, in a Data Protection Impact Assessment carried out by the Bank, the Data Protection Officer stated that: “The purpose of the processing is lawful on the basis of the rights of the data subjects and the business interests of the Bank, there is no direct or indirect legal prohibition. The processing is high-risk for several reasons, in particular the novelty of the technology used, as the audio recordings are analysed and findings are made automatically by artificial intelligence. The aggregate data is suitable for profiling or scoring for both sets of data subjects [customers and employees], and although no automated decision making is involved, the data processing may have legal effects on the data subjects. The high risk is mitigated by the controller through measures identified in the impact assessment, such as human decision-making at the end of automated processing. The exercise of data subjects' rights is ensured in accordance with standard practice.”","1.

"A former employee lodged a complaint with the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) about the unlawful forwarding of and access to their email inbox after they had left a company. The data subject had objected to the processing, but the controller had declined to sufficiently assess their objection, or to stop the processing.

The DPA's investigation revealed that the controller had not actually enabled automatic forwarding of the data subject's particular email address. They had also deleted the data subject's inbox shortly after they had left the company. Thus, the controller argued that they had not accessed the data subject's emails in any way.

However, in 2018 the company had enabled functionality that would retrieve and forward emails with certain keywords sent to non-registered email addresses belonging to their domain, to one collective inbox. The reason for this was evidently that a customer had once sent an email to an incorrect address and this functionality could mitigate the risk of not receiving customer emails. This also meant that even though the controller had deleted the data subject's inbox, emails sent to their address could still be routed to the company's collective inbox. This had happened once, according to the controller.","1.

"In 2018, the AEPD (Spain) received a complaint which raised doubts about whether Google LLC (controller) was handling requests to remove content in a legally correct manner. The complaint asserted that Google LLC, which is based in Mountain View California USA, was unlawfully sending copies of removal requests by users to a third party (the “Lumen Project”). This triggered a broader investigation of the AEPD into the way how Google handles removal requests and the right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR. In its investigation the AEPD found that Google provides a webpage named “Removing Content From Google” where a user can request the removal of content from the various Google services (33 at the time of writing). In the first step, the user had to select the particular Google service it wanted data to be removed from. In the second step, the user had to choose between predefined grounds for the request. Among these predefined grounds (which specific grounds are listed depends on the selected service in step one) are e.g. defamation, copyright infringement, harassment and personal information. The AEPD took special notice of some of these predefined grounds: e.g. when having selected “Google Search”, a user had, among others, the following three options of predefined grounds: “Remove personal information from Google under product policies”, “Legal personal information issue: request removal of my personal information from Google’s search results”, “Other legal issue: report content for a legal reason not already listed”. The AEPD further established in its investigation that, only if the user selected the right predefined grounds, he or she was provided with the link to the web form “EU Privacy Removal”. This was the only form which Google treated as a request to erasure under Article 17 GDPR. Furthermore, Google did not provide a link to this form in its privacy policy but rather linked to the web page “Removing Content From Google”.

By looking at this system, the AEPD also found – as the complaint asserted – that Google was sending removal requests, except the ones made under Article 17 GDPR, to the “Lumen Project”. The Lumen Project is a project of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society of the Harvard University which is collecting removal requests from different providers in a publicly accessible database. A typical entry in the database contains a summary of the request and a link to the original content. Before the user submitted a request for removal on the page “Removing Content From Google” he or she was informed by a banner that a copy of the request may be sent to the Lumen project for publication and that Lumen will redact the personal information. However, the AEPD found that the automated redaction process implemented by the Lumen Project often did not work, leaving personal data included in the requests unredacted in the database.

At the start of the proceedings, the AEPD forwarded the complaint to the DPC (Ireland). After one year, the DPC decided that it did not consider itself competent to handle the complaint since Google LLC and not Google Ireland Ltd was the controller of the processing in question.

Google LLC notably argued in the proceedings that the AEPD violated the consistency mechanism because it forwarded the case to the DPC only at the beginning of the proceedings – where only a violation of Article 6 GDPR was alleged – but not after having broadened the investigation to include a violation of Article 17 GDPR. Furthermore, it argued that the transfer of the requests to the Lumen Project were lawful under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR since the Lumen Project pursues educational, research and transparency purposes with the database.","1.

"In February 2021, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) notified the Norwegian DPA Datatilsynet about a personal data breach where they had published CVs without a legal basis. The DPA had also received 18 complaints from data subjects regarding the incident.

NAV, the controller, has since 2001 had online solutions for making job applicants' CVs available for logged-in employers. In February 2019, they launched a new online tool where job applicants could voluntarily register their CVs. The controller, however, also made these available to employers through a candidate search, by default, including CVs where the data subjects had not given their consent. In addition, the controller had required data subjects to publish their CV to receive certain social services and benefits.

In 2020, a data subject contacted NAV's Data Protection Officer about the processing and, consequently, the controller launched an internal review. They concluded that they lacked a legal basis as per Article 6(1) GDPR for publishing the CVs, as far back as 2001. The controller had assessed legal bases in national laws pertaining to them, but found that these could not be relied upon for this particular situation. The controller now also realised that they did not either have a legal basis for requiring data subjects to publish their CV like this to receive certain social services and benefits.

The CVs contained information about data subjects' name, place of residence, date of birth, telephone number, e-mail address, education, work and other relevant experience, courses, driver's licenses, access to vehicles, various approvals and certifications, language, stated competencies and job wishes. This information is subject to confidentiality as per national regulations applicable to the controller.

The controller informed the DPA that 535,900 CVs was part of the 2019 system and they estimated that the maximum number of affected data subjects was 1,8 million. When the controller realized the breach, they notified the DPA and tried to inform every affected data subject personally by email or letter, as well as via their website.","1.

First of all, the placement of cookies that were not strictly necessary - including statistical and social-network cookies - prior to consent of the data subject. The controller does not dispute this. However, it argues that the method used for the investigation was not reliable to establish a violation.

Second, the qualification of 'further browsing' as consent. The cookie-banner disappears if the user continues scrolling on the website. The controller argues that this is active behaviour that meets the active consent requirement of Planet 49.

"The controller, Accor, is a large, multinational chain that operates hotels in 110 countries. Between December 2018 and September 2019, the French DPA (CNIL) received several complaints concerning the controller's various potential violations of the GDPR.

On 24 Feburary 2020, the CNIL conducted an investigation of the controller's website. Users supplied their contact information, including email address, when they registered an account with the controller. The registration process featured a pre-ticked box indicating consent to receive promotional materials. Data subjects subsequently started receiving these promotional materials in their inboxes. They were unable to unsubscribe from direct marketing emails, as various technical glitches prevented the emails' ""unsubscribe"" button from working. Several million people received these emails at valid addresses, though the CNIL's published decision redacted the exact amount.

Additionally, the website did not provide data subjects with information about the controller's contact details, the purposes of processing for the data collected, the legal basis for processing, the period for which the data would be retained, potential transfers, or the right to lodge a complaint under the GDPR, and there was no link to a privacy policy that might contain this information.

The CNIL also received one complaint regarding difficulties encountered exercising the right of access to personal banking data processed by the controller. The controller had failed to respond to an access request after locking a data subject's account for suspected fraudulent activity even after data subject verified their identity.

Finally, for the controller to access the ""Adobe Campaign"" account responsible for managing these email communications, a weak password consisting of seven capital letters and one special character was required, although access was only possible from a terminal connected to the ACCOR network.

Ten other supervisory authorities declared themselves to be concerned supervisory authorities, and the CNIL was also notified of five additional complaints by the supervisory authorities of Saarland, Spain, Ireland, Poland, and Lower Saxony. The controller's main establishment was determined to be in France, where more than half of its hotels were located. As such, the CNIL was the lead supervisory authority per Article 56(1) GDPR.","1.

"The University Clinical Center of the Medical University of Warsaw (the controller) gave one of its patients a referral to a specialist clinic. Due to the referring doctor's error, the referral included personal data relating to another person (the data subject). It included the data subject's first name, surname, address, PESEL number (i.e. an eleven-digit numeric symbol, uniquely identifying a natural person, containing the date of birth, serial number, gender and a control number) and health-related information, such as their diagnosis.

Since the first name of the data subject contained a typo, the controller considered that the data in question related to a non-existing person. For this reason, the controller decided that the incident was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject and did not notify the DPA or the data subject of the data breach.","1.

"The DPA received 17 notifications of data breaches regarding Raiffeisen Bank SA (the controller). The notifications were (for the most part) done by the controller itself and affected its customers (the data subjects). Therefore, the DPA started an investigation into the controller. During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller used the systems managed by the Credit Bureau S.A., the National Tax Administration Agency (ANAF) and its own IT systems to simulate credit decisions (""pre-scoring"") for an external credit broker.

Two notifications were about pre-scoring operations carried out for (potential) customers, concerning at least 169 data subjects. The DPA found that the controller used the Credit Bureau System without the necessary signature from the data subjects to access their data in the respective system.

The controller further notified the DPA about a data breach that resulted in the context of loans to individual data subjects with the help of an external company, acting as a processor. Apparently, some data subjects were approved for loans without them having requested them and without having signed any relevant documents regarding these loans.

In addition, four data breaches happened in the context of email communications. The cause for every one of these data breaches was that the controller entered a wrong e-mail address. In one case, as a result of two data subjects submitting similar complaints, the controller sent documents containing personal data belonging to one data subject to the other.

Another incident concerned a situation involving suspected internal credit fraud. To investigate the suspected fraud, the controller carried out specific operations to grant a loan to a data subject without the presence of the data subject. The controller applied for credit facilities, completed and signed the documentation related to the credit facility. To update the data subjects' data in its application, the controller changed the data subjects' phone number with a phone number of one of its employees and entered a fictitious email address. A similar data breach took place when the controller granted three credit facilities (Flexicredit, Flexicredit refinancing and Purchasing Card) in the name of a data subject without the latter having actually requested these.

Before the pandemic, it claimed to have 50 operations a day, but didn’t provide any statistics how much operations were undertaken each day during – and after the pandemic.

In those cases, parties protected their contact details precisely to avoid the other party getting to know their whereabouts, e.g. due to concerns about child abduction, violence, etc.

The disclosures happened mainly because of a human error when responding to information access requests, information letters, party hearings and sending decisions. Case handlers would not pay enough attention to the information and thereby did not anonymise it. The controller emphasised that it processes thousands of cases each year. Despite the strong focus on avoiding accidental disclosure of personal data and continuous work to improve data security, human errors can occur when employees perform their job.

The DPA became concerned that using transaction data to make inferences about health conditions could constitute profiling, and the inferences made about health conditions could indicate processing of special category data.

"The data subject submitted a claim against an insurance company (the controller) for allowing changes to their health insurance policy. The insurance policy was initially signed in 2016 and linked to the data subject as policyholder as well as the owner of the bank account from which the insurance premiums were paid. However, the insured person was their former partner.

In June 2021, the data subject’s former partner submitted a request to change the health insurance policy data, which was done by the bank (the processor). The data changed were the policyholder name and the bank account to which the insurance premiums were associated, allowing the data subject’s former partner to pay the insurance fees themselves. These changes were made without the consent of the data subject.

After a first complaint by the data subject to the processor, the data subject was included as the insurance holder again. After a further complaint, their bank account number was restored.

In August 2022, the Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the controller, which allowed to hear the claims from the involved parties. Both the controller and the processor claimed to have obtained implicit consent from the data subject since their initial wish was to cover their partner and that, by losing their status as insurance holder, their obligations were lifted, which was considered a presumed benefit for the data subject.","1.

The list allowed the identification of health data relating to disabilities.

In addition, the list corresponded with the provisional publication of results by the Galician Health Services (SERGAS), the authority competent for the examination and selection of candidates.

Furthermore, the publication allegedly did not include the mandatory information regarding the origin of the data nor the right to object.

In response, the controller argued that the legal basis was legitimate interest since the academy offered training courses and the publication showed the participants, in a clear way, the position obtained. The controller stated that it was not processing carried out in the context of their usual activity since it was done only once, in relation with that specific selection process. Another argument was that the information had been made public by SERGAS and that candidates who participated in the public selection process expected their data to be published due to transparency obligations.","1.

"The controller operates a facial recognition tool (the tool) to identify data subjects using pictures and video's posted online (online content). The controller is established in the United States and has no establishment in the European Union (EU), but processes personal data of EU data subjects. Specifically, it collects online content in which faces appear, including faces of minors.

The tool indexes freely accessible web pages and social media platforms. After the indexing, the tool extracts all images with faces of data subjects. Based on these images, the tool calculates a mathematical hash for each data subject, which is in turn based on a unique biometric template of the face in the picture. The mathematical hash is used to make data subjects searchable in the database.

The controller sells access to its database to third parties. These third parties can upload a picture of a face to start a search in order to identify data subject, after which the tool creates a mathematical hash for this uploaded picture. This new hash is compared with existing hashes in the database. When the hashes are similar, the tool collects all the images with the same hash, including a reference to the original source of each picture. This process makes it possible to identify data subjects.

In its privacy policy, the controller stated that data subjects could only exercise their right of access twice a year. The controller did not mention a retention period for the personal data.

The DPA received several complaints from data subjects regarding the rights of access (Article 15 GDPR) and erasure (Article 17 GDPR) between May and December 2020. One data subject requested a third party to make an access request on her behalf. The controller acknowledged that it had received this request and invited the data subject to use an online platform to exercise her right of access, but failed to answer follow up requests on multiple occasions. When answering to the last request, the controller also asked for the submission of a photograph and ID card and repeated the invitation to use an online platform to exercise the right of access. After 4 months and 7 letters, the controller provided access for this data subject. Another data subject had complained that it had submitted an request for erasure (Article 17 GDPR), but had never received an answer form the controller. The DPA started an investigation following these complaints.

During the investigation, on 26 November 2021, the DPA also ordered the controller to comply with several GDPR Articles. The controller did not provide a response.

In order to sign up for an Internet competition, participants have to give consent for the controller to process information about them and to pass it on to the controller's business partners. In the present case, the collected data included e-mail addresses, gender, IP addresses, date of birth, telephone numbers and postal addresses of the participants.

"Tet (the controller) is an internet service provider which also offers additional services in the telecommunications and entertainment sectors. The Latvian DPA started an ex officio investigation into the controller's data processing practices. Specifically, it looked into the transfers of customers' (data subjects) data to out-of-court debt recovery service providers. The controller claimed that these transfers were carried out for the purpose of, among others, checking the solvency of data subjects when preparing a contract.

In the course of the investigation, the DPA found that the solvency checks with a debt recovery service happened without prior identity checks of the data subjects. In one case, because the controller had not verified the accuracy of the information provided by a customer, personal data of a minor was transferred to the debt recovery service.

On 15 July 2022, the DPA issued the original decision imposing the fine. On 2 August 2022, it received the controller's request for an oral hearing to express that the fine, among others, was disproportionate and not accurate, in addition to the proceedings before the DPA exceeding the time limits and allegedly not allowing the controller to exercise its rights.","1.

Furthermore, the data subject complained about the controller’s failure to respond to its request to exercise its rights under Articles 15, 17 and 21 GDPR.

The controller stated that it never had access to the data subject's data. In fact, the marketing communication was allegedly sent by another company. Namely, one that it hired in the past for the promotion of a different event. This task was allegedly given orally to that company in return for remuneration. Confident in the guarantees offered by that company in the field of the promotion of shows and cultural events, also on behalf of third parties, the controller did not deem it necessary at the time to exercise a power of control or issue instructions.

Furthermore, the controller stated that the marketing company would have acted as an autonomous controller, because it would have independently determined the means of processing and the recipients of the communications. The marketing company used its own list of contacts, that was never in possession of the controller. To substantiate this claim, the controller added that it did not own the email address used to send the promotional message.

"The controller is a limited liability company in Hungary and also part of the Samlerhuset Group, an international group of companies based in Amsterdam. It sold different versions of commemorative and historical coins, with a specific focus on Hungarian history. The controller acquired the data of its customers as follows: they can place an order by filling in a form, received as part of advertising materials via postal mail. This data includes name, address, phone number, e-mail address.

Since July 2020, the DPA received several complaints from data subjects concerning the processing of their data by the controller and objecting to its data processing practices. In most cases, the controller created a user account (profile) with the personal data provided during the purchase or ordering process. However, it only informed the data subjects afterwards about the processing. The DPA therefore carried out a test registration on the controller's website and analysed the privacy notices on the website and from the postal mail. Based on its findings, the DPA suspected an infringement of GDPR and launched an investigation.

During the DPA’s investigation, the controller provided the following information on its data processing: potential new customers received a promotional mailing by post. In the controller's view, this did not constitute direct marketing under the Hungarian Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing. The controller argued that the promotional material was sent to the data subjects together with a newspaper, to which they were subscribed pursuant to a contract with another separate company. Thus, the controller did not contact data subjects directly by itself. The data subjects could then contact the controller online, by phone or by post, in case they would like to order coins.

In the online shopping process, the information on data processing is linked at the end of the order. The controller emphasized that the online registration did not involve the processing of any more personal data than a purchase without registration. It was also possible to order products by phone or by post, without registering an online account. The data subjects gave their consent by signing the order form in writing for postal orders, verbally for phone orders and by ticking a specific checkbox for online orders.

The controller also informed the DPA that for the purpose of targeted advertising on Facebook and Google social media platforms, the controller manually selected – without automated decision-making – a group of its customers with an e-mail address for whom the given advertisement may be relevant. This list of addresses was hashed and uploaded to the Facebook and Google advertising systems for the display of the advertisement to data subjects whose email address hash matched an element of the uploaded hash list.

The controller further stressed that it found data protection highly important, and it employed a dedicated data protection officer (DPO) as well.","1.

"The Portuguese DPA started an investigation into the Municipality of Setubal (controller) after a journalistic article from the newspaper Expresso was published titled Ukrainians welcomed in CDU Chamber by Pro-Putin Russians' (""Ucranianos recebidos em Câmara CDU por russos Pró-Putin"").

This article contained anonymous accounts of Ukrainian refugees. According to the Article, Russian citizens were present in the same room where Ukrainian refugees' personal data was stored (such as copies of identification documents). These Russian citizens - allegedly part of an Eastern European Immigrants' Association (EDINSTVO), an organisation for the support of eastern European migrants - also asked the refugees questions about the whereabouts of their relatives and what they were doing in Ukraine. In total, two members of the EDINSTVO were integrated by the controller into the Setúbal Office of Ethnicities and Immigration (SEI) in order to provide assistance, counselling and help to the refugees. According to the author of the article, these Russian citizens were accused in the article of sharing this personal data with the Russian Government.

This all happened in the framework of a Municipal Refugee Helpline (LIMAR), which was created in March 2022. The controller was responsible for the processing done by this helpline. The Helpline used two rooms of the controller's building in order to offer their services, one for the customer service and the other for archiving. Both rooms were only accessible for members of the helpline.

The helpline used two forms in order to collect the data from refugees seeking attendance: an assistance form and telephone assistance form. Using these forms, personal data was collected by the controller. Among other things, the controller collected the name, address, date of birth, marital status, information on the support network (identifying the places and people they might stay with and their respective households) and information on the period they might stay with the people in that support network, in addition to describing the specific situation of each refugee. The assistance forms were handwritten and were stored in a filing cabinet. All collected personal data was later also put into an Excel file which was protected by password.

Additionally, forms were accompanied by a declaration of consent for processing. The controller asked refugees for consent to authorise that the data records collected may be shared with other services or entities for the purpose of to specific responses or to provide social support adjusted to the situation adjusted to the situation, with the guarantees of privacy and non-discrimination'. Furthermore, together with the assistance forms, refugees were also offered to sign up for Portuguese language courses, for which they needed to provide a copy of an identification document.

In this context, one of the Russian citizens, who acted as a translator, was on medical leave for some time. This translator was informally substituted by her husband. The translator had given her husband her login-credentials to access the helpline's systems. This change was not documented or formalised in any way. The husband, who was not a controller's employee, helped to collect and copy personal data and documents from various refugees and acted as a translator himself.","1.

"In May 2022, the Norwegian DPA was approached by a grocery chain and a payment transaction provider regarding an instruction the former had received from the national statistical institute Statistics Norway (SSB), to submit purchase data (""bongdata"" in Norwegian) to them. The DPA had also received several complaints and inquiries from private parties regarding this matter, and in June they asked SSB, by letter, to clarify. Following their reply, the DPA and SSB had a meeting in August.

The various interactions clarified that SSB had instructed the main grocery chains in Norway (Rema 1000, NorgesGruppen, Coop and Bunnpris, accounting for about 99% of the Norwegian grocery market) to start submitting purchase data (""bongdata"" in Norwegian) to them on a regular basis, including:

* name of item
* price per item* total amount of the receipt
* payment method
* amount per payment method
* start and end time of the purchase
* ID of returns
* ID for terminated purchase
* ID of offers/discounts

The data would be reported directly from the point of sale systems so that SSB would receive the data continuously. Purchased items would be classified into product groups and consumers would be classified by size and type of household, income, level of education and country region. This would be contingent on a connection to transactional data/bank account number and then birth date.

The purchase data do not in themselves contain any personal data. The intention is, however, to connect these with transactional data which then makes it possible to relate the data to an individual person. SSB will link these to transaction data quickly after continuously receiving them, and thus the DPA finds that it is correct to view the purchase data as personal data from the point of collection, and references Recital 26 GDPR. Because of this, the DPA assessed the interference the collection of purchase data represents.

SSB's claimed legal basis for the processing was the Norwegian Statistics Act § 10 Duty to provide information, which states that ""any person must provide the data that are necessary to develop, produce or disseminate official statistics if so ordered by Statistics Norway"". The purpose of the intended processing was to develop, produce and disseminate official statistics as per the Statistics Act, and SSB considered the processing to be necessary. During the investigation, SSB shared two data protection impact assessments (DPIA) with the DPA, one dated 27 January 2021 and the other from the period October 2021 to June 2022.","1.

"The French DPA (CNIL) started an investigation into Discord, a company based in the United States (controller). This controller provided a free of charge online service that allowed data subjects to communicate online using text, voice - and video.

The investigation service of the DPA  determined several shortcomings.

During the investigation, the controller stated that it did not have a written data retention policy. The investigation service confirmed that there were 2,474,000 French data subject accounts in the controller’s database that had not been used for more than three years and 58,000 accounts that had not been used for more than five years. During the procedure, the controller added a data retention policy, which described that the controller would delete user accounts after two years of inactivity.

The investigation service found that the information the controller provided regarding data retention periods was incomplete. There were no specific periods or criteria for determining these retention periods. The controller changed this element of the privacy policy during the procedure.

The investigation service also addressed a specific problem about the application for Microsoft Windows: when a data subject, logged in to a voice room, closed the controller’s application window by clicking on the ""X"" icon at the top right of the application, the application would continue to run in the background and the data subject would remain logged in. However, in the majority of Microsoft Windows applications, clicking on the ""X"" will close the application. This 'background minimization' was activated after the first install of the controller's software. The data subject was not informed about this background minimization.  During the procedure, the controller implemented a pop-up window to alert data subjects that the application was still running, when the application window was closed for the first time. The controller also informed data subjects that this setting (remain logged in after closure of application) could be changed in the settings.

At the time of the online investigation, when creating an account, the controller accepted a password of six characters including letters and numbers. The controller also adjusted this during the proceedings: it now required data subjects to use a password of at least eight characters, with at least three of the four different character types. Also, after ten unsuccessful login attempts, the controller now required a captcha prompt to be solved, which was previously not the case.

The investigation service also determined that the controller had previously deemed it unnecessary to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA).  During the procedure, the controller carried out two impact assessments, in which the controller concluded that its processing was not likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.","1.

"The data subject submitted a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR with Douglas Italia S.p.a (the controller). However, she did not receive a response. Therefore, she submitted a complaint with the Italian DPA, asking it to assess what happened. The DPA contacted the controller, requesting further information on the matter. The controller replied that the legal basis for processing was the data subject's membership in its loyalty programme. The controller held that the data subject gave free and specific consent for the processing, and that any refusal to processing would not have prevented her from obtaining the loyalty card. The controller also stated that it had not received the data subject's request, but confirmed that her revocation of consent and cancellation was now handled. The DPA was not satisfied with this response, and initiated an inspection at the controller's headquarters.

Prior to the inspection, the controller highlighted that it was formed in 2019 as a result of the merging of three companies (Limoni Spa, La Gardenia Beauty Spa and Profumerie Douglas Spa) and that it was subject to the management and supervision of its German parent company, Douglas GMBH.

Management of requests to exercise data subject rights

During the on-site inspection, the controller showed the DPA how they normally manage data subject's requests. The DPA concluded that the failure to respond to the data subject's request was a one-time occurrence, compared to the management of other requests, which, as a rule, were handled correctly and timely (within 2-3 days). The DPA therefore decided not pursue an investigation into the possible violation of Article 12(3) GDPR.

Data collection through the Douglas app

The DPA also tested the data collection through the controller's app. The DPA tested the app, and found that the during registration, the user was invited to accept the general terms and conditions, privacy policy, cookie policy and more with a single button ('Ok, I understand, I agree'). Later, when creating the account, the app asked for an e-mail address and date of birth.

The processing of customer data acquired through the merger

During the inspection, the DPA also asked the controller to provide some examples of separate marketing disclosures and consents, for the three companies, before the merger. However, the controller was not able to provide any proof or information regarding the latter. It justified this by stating that it was no longer possible due to the creation of a single database after the merger.

Retention of data relating to customer who have not renewed their loyalty card

The DPA also found that the data of 3,288,170 customers of the three pre-existing companies, who did not activate or renew the loyalty card, were stored on the servers of the German parent company.

The information given to customers

Additionally, the DPA discovered that the information provided to customers on purposes of processing and the legal basis was incomplete and inadequate. The privacy policy informed interested parties that their data would be processed for a variety of purposes on the basis of consent. However, no information was provided on how data collected separately by the three companies was processed after the merger.

Telemarketing carried out by the stores

Regarding the controller's telemarketing activities, the DPA found that customers who consented only to receive promotional SMS notifications, could in reality also receive promotional phone calls, and vice versa. Moreover, the controller admitted to having no scripts prepared for how to conduct the promotional phone calls with respect to protecting the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

Data processing via blogs

Last, the DPA found that there was no information about data processing when interacting with the controller's blog in its privacy policy. The DPA asked the controller to provide the quantitative data of data subjects who had interacted with the blog, as well as the most recent data relating to the registered comments and information on their registration, storage, and the methods and purposes for which they are used. The controller was not able to provide this information.","1.

"Between October 2018 and November 2019, the DPA received 41 complaints regarding FREE, a French communications provider (controller), after which the DPA started an investigation based on 10 of these complaints. Some of these complaints concerned access requests for information regarding the data broker from which the controller got personal data. The controller did not respond to these requests in time or provided incomplete answers. According to the controller, the requests were not answered in time due to human error. However, specifically with regard to information regarding the source of the data, the controller stated that it was not obliged to reveal information that was deemed a 'business secret' according to recital 63 and Article 15(4) GDPR (in this case, the identity of the data broker who supplied the data). The controller also stated that it had recently changed its internal procedure, and now asked its data brokers to also provide the identity of the primary source of the data collection, which the controller could then provide to the data subjects.

The data subjects also requested the deletion of their e-mail accounts. However, the DPA confirmed that data subject’s personal data was still present in the controller’s database after they had submitted their erasure requests. Also, these e-mail accounts still had the status of ‘active’ and data subjects were still able to access their e-mails.

On 8 February 2019, the controller also notified the DPA of a personal data breach. The controller had distributed 4.137 refurbished hardware boxes, called FREE-boxes, to new subscribers. The main use of this FREE-box was to store television programmes, but could also be used to store personal photos and personal video’s. The DPA found that these boxes still contained the personal data of subscribers who had used this hardware previously. The controller did not wipe the data from the device. The controller had accidentally deleted a procedure from its security measures, intended to erase the data stored on the boxes before redistribution. Three years after the breach was reported, 322 boxes were still used by subscribers, without the controller knowing if these boxes contained data of previous subscribers. These boxes were only remotely deactivated by the controller on July 2022, also more than three years after the breach.","1.

"Based on a notification of a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR by Casa Rusu SRL, a controller, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. During its investigation, the DPA found that the breach was the result of insufficient security measures in the online payments section of the controller's website. The website's data bank stored the bank details of the controller's clients. By using an unauthorized entry in the website's security form, a breach occurred which gave an unauthorized party access to the personal data of the controller's clients and data subjects, namely: the first and last name of bank card holders, their card numbers, the date and year of expiry of the bank cards, and the bank card's CVC code.

The DPA's investigation showed that the controller did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures, both at the time of establishing the means of processing the personal data, and at the time of the processing itself.

"The controller is a manufacturer of heart rate monitors and smart watches offering its services in multiple Member States in the EU and wordwide. Customers (data subjects) had to register for an online service in order to use all the features of the devices, which required personal information, such as gender, height, age and weight. The device collected heart rate, max VO2 (maximum oxygen capacity) as well as BMI (body mass index) information and uploaded them to the online service. Data subjects could use the collected information to analyse training performance.

The Finnish DPA received five complaints from data subjects between 22 May 2018 and 19 February 2019.  The Austrian DPA received one complaint on the same matter. The complaints addressed fours main issues.

First, according to the complaints, the consent to process heart rate data was forced onto the data subjects as the controller made the use of the online service conditional upon granting consent to process heart rate data. If the data subject subseqently withdrew consent, their online service account would be frozen. However, according to the controller, the device was separate from the online service as some basic features were still usable without the online service.

Second, the controller also requested consent for the processing of other personal data, such as max VO2, sleep target time and daily activity target, next to information such as gender, age, height and weight. The controller argued that it was not possible to draw conclusions about a person's health based on this 'raw' data, hence there was no processing of sensitive data other than heart rate data. Allegedly, such conclusions about health would only be possible with the help of medical exminations or additional data.

Third, the complaints questioned the lawfulness of data transfers to third countries. Although the controller's servers were located in the EU, in Finland and Ireland, personal data from the controller's email service would be sent to a server located in the US. For these transfers, the controller used as a legal basis consent under Article 49(1)(a) GDPR (prior to November 2019). The controller submitted that it had asked data subjects for consent to transfer the data to the US in order to make them more aware of the processing carried out by the company.

Fourth, the data subjects noted that while accepting the terms and conditions, they also had to consent to the controller processing ""user-generated content"", that is any content uploaded or transmitted to the online service (e.g. training results) apart from the information initially provided. There was no separate consent form for the processing of user-generated content. This data would be made available globally and also transferred outside the EU. If the data subject withdrew their consent, the user-generated data would not be removed. The data subject could request their deletion only by closing their account.

Because the controller operated in multiple Member States, the cooperation mechanism under Article 60 GDPR was activated. Since the controller's main establishment was located in Finland, the Finnish DPA was the lead supervisory authority (Article 65 GDPR), while the concerned supervisory authorities (Article 4(22) GDPR) were, among others, the Austrian, Belgian, Czech and Danish DPAs. After investigating the controller's processing practices as well as receiving the submissions by the concerned supervisory authorities, the Finnish DPA issued a draft decision pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR. No objections were raised by concerned supervisory authorities, rendering it a binding decision on the controller.","1.

The case is based on three different reports made to DPA. In two cases data subject didn't receive any replies from the company and in one case data subject got a general reply but not the information requested.

In the case of one data subject, Alektum Oy explained the non-response by saying that it no longer processed personal data of the data subject. DPA stated that even then, the company should have responded to the data subject and inform that they no longer process the data subjects personal data.

In case 6707/154/2018 data subject requested to use his right to be forgotten as defined in article 17. Alektum Oy denied to remove data from their system.

"The courier and logistics company PostNord (the controller) offers their customers a service MyPostNord, where they can schedule and track parcels as well as obtain advantages such as faster bookings. MyPostNord can also be accessed through an mobile app.

In February and March 2020, the controller submitted two data breach notifications to the Norwegian DPA, relating to cases where unauthorised persons were able to access customer profiles of others. The unauthorised persons were able to access the profiles because the controller used phone numbers as the only means of authentication. Entering someone else's number (for example an incorrect one) could give them access to other persons' personal data, including name, gender, postal address, email address, phone number, order- and payment history, shipments underway and sender name. The same happened in cases where there was a new owner of the phone number previously used in the MyPostNord service and where the pervious owner of the same phone number did not update their profile information.

In addition to the controller's breach notifications, the DPA received information from the public about similar incidents. The DPA initiated an investigation and requested information from the controller. Specifically, the DPA asked for the risk assessment of the service MyPostNord and related processing systems.

"The Church of Norway (the controller) used information about new births from the National Population Register disclosed on the basis of national law, including sensitive data. If at least one parent was an existing member of the Church, the controller was allowed to register newborns (as 'affiliated persons') in their member register and, on the same condition, they also had permission as per the national population regulations to receive automatic notifications on newborns. This permission expired on 1 October 2018, and on 1 January 2021 the other relevant regulations were replaced.

"The data subject applied for a vacant position at the company H.M.B. EAD (controller). After signing some paperwork, the data subject and the controller agreed to another meeting in order to finalise the employment contract. On 28 April 2021, before such meeting took place, the controller sent the papers signed by the data subject to the 'National Revenue agency' (NRA).  According to Article 62(5) of the Bulgarian Labour code, an employer had to notify the NRA within three days of signing/closing the employement contract. In the end, the data subject did not complete the application procedure.

The data subject stated that she had been registered as an unemployed person on 8 February 2021 and had been granted unemployment benefits for three months. However, the benefits suddenly stopped, which is why the data subject checked with the social insurance institution for the cause of this issue. Here, she discovered that the controller had filed the signed papers as an employment contract, which had made her ineligible to receive further unemployment benefits.

The data subject filed a complaint at the Bulgarian DPA, stating that the controller unlawfully processed her data by submitting an employment contract without her knowledge. The data subject stated that she did not sign any employment contract and did not provide any personal data to the controller.

The controller stated that the allegations of the data subject were false. It stated that on 17 April 2021, the data subject had provided her CV to the controller in order to apply for a vacant job position. The controller did not deny that an employment contract had not formally been signed yet, but stated that the job-offer documents contained all the aspects of an employment contract and could therefore be regarded as such. This was also the reason why the company submitted the documents to the NRA pursuant to Article 62(5) of the Labour code. The signed documents also included a declaration of consent by the data subject to process her personal data. These documents contained several categories of personal data, such as full name, unique nationality number, address, identity card number, email, a photograph and a telephone number.

In response to these arguments, the data subject admitted that she had sent the CV and signed a consent for the processing of her data.

"Following a report received from the police on 15 July 2020, the Italian DPA sent two requests for information to the owner of Naija Market International, the controller, a company engaged in the grocery business in Modena. These requests sought further information regarding the installation of a video surveillance system on store premises. After the controller did not comply with the requests, the Italian DPA carried out an inspection at the controller's two operating sites, which revealed the presence of video surveillance cameras filming interior spaces of the establishments and therefore potentially suitable for monitoring the work activities of the controller's employees. The cameras were operating in the absence of the appropriate information signs, an alleged violation the Article 5(1)(a) GDPR principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and the transparency obligations in Article 13 GDPR. Furthermore, the surveillance system was installed without first obtaining permission from the territorially competent Labour Department, in violation of Italian Law.

Responding to the allegations, the controller claimed to be unaware of the obligation to inform the Labour department and, because they are a foreign national, unable to understand the particularly technical data protection regulation. Moreover, the controller argued that the conduct involved only 3 employees, and therefore this was only a minor violation.","1.

"On 21 September 2021, the data subject opened a bank account, which he closed again less than two months after, on 5 November 2021. On the same day, he also requested the deletion of his data. According to the data subject, this request was denied on 19 November 2021. On 7 December 2021, the data subject received an offer from the controller by e-mail for a consumer loan, despite the fact he was no longer a customer of the controller and did not use any of its services anymore. The data subject submitted a complaint at the Bulgarian DPA (DPA) because of the unlawful processing of his personal data for direct marketing purposes.

During the proceedings, the controller confirmed that the marketing e-mail was sent but stated that this had been the result of an error, caused by an additional safety mechanism implemented by the controller. This mechanism was designed for customers who closed their accounts unusually quickly, which was in less than three months. The controller had to retain certain information of former clients in order to comply with the national Anti-Money Laundering Act. Since the data subject had only been a client for less than two months, his data was kept but subsequently included in the list for direct marketing e-mails. The controller emphasised that a minimal amount of personal data was processed as a result of this error (first name and e-mail address) and that the data subject had not been profiled.

The controller also explained that for its commercial campaigns, it had several criteria to exclude e-mail addresses from its mailing list. The first criterion was to determine whether the status of the customer was 'active' or 'inactive'. If the status was 'inactive', the e-mail address belonged to a former customer and would not be included in the list. The second criterion was when a data subject had refused to receive direct marketing from the controller. In that case, the respective e-mail address would also not be included in the mailing list.

Because of the safety mechanism, the status of the data subject was still 'active' despite the fact he was no longer a customer of the controller. Because he also did not object to personalised marketing when he had opened his bank account, his e-mail address was included in the mailing list.","1.

"On April 2020 an early childhood education unit (pre-school) sent an inquiry along with an informational letter regarding activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The families were asked to return the form, providing personal data (including the child's social security number) and stating whether they could arrange childcare at home during the pandemic.

A letter accompanying the inquiry form stated that handling personal data is based on consent and that the data subject gives consent by returning the form. In reality many parents were told that returning the questionnaire was mandatory.

The controller responded to the DPA's request for information, stating that returning the inquiry form was voluntary but strongly desirable. The information was needed to arrange activities during exceptional circumstances due to the COVID pandemic. The controller agreed that the voluntary nature of the inquiry could have been more clearly communicated.

"The controller is Luka Inc, a US-based company that developed and operated Replika, an AI-powered chatbot.

According to the controller, Replika can improve the user's mood and emotional well-being by helping them understand their thoughts and feelings, keep track of their mood, learn coping skills (i.e., stress control), calm anxiety, and work towards goals such as positive thinking, stress management, socialising, and finding love. In other words, Replika provides a kind of 'virtual friend' that users can configure as friend, partner or mentor.

Various reports were published in Italian media concerning inappropriate content on the Replika app, which would pose concrete risks particularly to minors and emotionally vulnerable people. Subsequently, the Italian DPA conducted an investigation focusing on the collection of personal data and the app’s age verification mechanisms.

The investigation revealed that, regardless of what the company stated in its privacy policy or terms of service, no age verification procedure was in place when users created an account. Moreover, the controller had not implemented any blocking method for users who could be believed to be underage during the use of Replika, for example based on the content of their responses.

The investigation also showed that the privacy policy failed to disclose information on the key elements of the processing, in particular the legal grounds and the use of children’s personal data.","1.

In 2021, they had between 1.6 million and 2.4 million monthly visitors and a net revenue of  49,000,000,000 HUF (approx. €127,000,000).

Based on a ""public interest notification"" the Hungarian DPA started an ex officio investigation into the data processing of the websites. There was a concern that the controller did not provide data subjects with adequate information about the processing and that the consent management platform (CMP) on the websites did not collect the consent of data subjects in a transparent and clear manner.

The investigation revealed a number of potential data protection deficits.

The CMP of the controller offered data subject's with the possibility to give consent to cookies by clicking an ""OK, continue"" button. However, the only alternative was a ""more options"" button which redirected to a second level of the CMP with more information and more detailed consent options. On this second level of the CMP, users were provided with two tabs for different categories of processing. On one tab, the user was able to give ""consent"" to different processing purposes. The other tab was titled ""legitimate interest"" and allowed the data subjects to object to data processing. Confusingly, the processes listed in both tabs was almost completely identical. They included purposes such as ""selection of basic ads"", ""Measuring ad performance"", and ""creating a personalized advertising profile"". The processing purposes """"storing and/or accessing information stored on the device"""" was only listed under the consent tab.

Regarding the meaning of ""legitimate interest"" the controller explained that, the way in which it is used on the website, the term would not relate to the legal basis under the GDPR but was meant as a ""category"". Consequently, the controller also had made no interest assessment.

Lastly, it was unclear to the DPA how consent could be withdrawn, once it had been given.","1. The case involves a covered entity (TV2 Media Group Ltd.) and an individual (data subject) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

END OF EXAMPLE

Solution:
1. The case involves a covered entity (TV2 Media Group Ltd.) and an individual (data subject) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).
2. The case describes a situation where the covered entity (TV2 Media Group Ltd.) provided the individual (data subject) with the possibility to give consent to cookies by clicking an ""OK, continue"" button. However, the only alternative was a ""more options"" button which redirected to a second level of the CMP with more information and more detailed consent options. On this second level of the CMP, users were provided with two tabs for different categories of processing. On one tab, the user was able to give ""consent"" to different processing purposes. The other tab was titled ""legitimate interest"" and allowed the data subjects to object to data processing. Confusingly, the processes listed in both tabs was almost completely identical. They included purposes such as ""selection of basic ads"", ""Measuring ad performance"", and ""creating a personalized advertising profile"". The processing purposes """"storing and/or accessing information stored on the device"""" was only listed under the consent tab. (Article 13)

"The company SATS ASA (the controller) is a provider of fitness and training services. It has its headquarters in Norway and is also active in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The company has over 270 clubs, about 9,000 employees and more than 700,000 members.

According to one of these members (data subject 1), the controller had transferred their personal data to other companies within its corporate group in May 2018. The controller had also transferred data to Facebook, which was located outside the EU/EEA, without a proper legal ground. This data subject further claimed that an access request, submitted on 29 August 2018, had remained unanswered. Data subject 1 filed a complaint at the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) on 2 October 2018.

Another member (data subject 2), who had already terminated their membership, claimed that the controller had not responded to an access request (Article 15 GDPR), which was submitted on 25 February 2019. The controller had also refused to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR) submitted on the same date. Data subject 2 filed a complaint at the DPA on 1 March 2019.

Another member (data subject 3), who had also terminated their membership, claimed that the controller had refused to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR), which was submitted on 05 October 2019. Data subject 3 filed a complaint at the DPA on 07 October 2019.

On 7 September 2021 and 5 October 2021, the DPA formally approached the controller and asked the company to express its views on the issues raised in Complaint No 2 and Complaint No 3. The controller replied on 1 December 2021.

On 8 December 2021, the DPA received yet another complaint from a member (data subject 4) concerning the controller’s refusal to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR), submitted on 6 August 2021.

On 23 March 2022, the DPA sent further questions to the controller on all of the above complaints and received the controller’s response on 28 April 2022.

Despite receiving the complaints over a fairly long time period, the DPA decided to handle the complaints jointly, considering the fact that all of them concerned similar alleged infringements. Another reason the DPA opted to handle the complaints jointly was 'procedural efficiency'.

On 26 September 2022, after their investigation, the DPA sent the controller an advance notification of their intention to issue an administrative fine of NOK10,000,000 (ten million) (Around €916,000) for violating several GDPR provisions.

The controller responded to the DPA on 31 October 2022 and argued, among other things, that It was ""arbitrary from the part of Datatilsynet (DPA) to [find] a violation of Article 12(3) GDPR and Article 15 GDPR due to a failure to respond to an access request that was submitted around a month after the GDPR became applicable in Norway, as at that time many companies experienced challenges in applying the new rules"".

The controller also stated that the DPA's conclusion that the controller violated both Article 12(3) GDPR and Article 15 GDPR would violate the principle of ne bis in idem.

The controller also argued that the assessment of the necessity of a storage period is to a large extent discretionary, noting that the DPA was not in the position to do this and should refrain from questioning the assessment made by the controller. The controller made the same statement concerning the choice of legal bases.

Despite the controller's arguments, the DPA submitted a draft decision on 30 December 2022 to the other supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, which was in line with the above advance notification. The DPA did not receive any relevant and reasoned objections and, consequently, upheld their advance notification.","1.

"On 14 February 2019, the Luxembourg DPA decided to open an investigation into the companies of Group A and particularly into Company A, a bank institution (controller). The purpose of this investigation was to verify the compliance with the GDPR of the controller's video surveillance and company's cars geolocation systems.

Surveillance cameras

The investigation showed that surveillance cameras were indeed in place. Cameras’ fields of view included safe rooms, meeting rooms, the reception desk, the cash desk, offices, a computer room and a room where employees take breaks. The head of the investigation considered this to be permanent surveillance of employees at their workplace, which could create psychological pressure. He described the surveillance as “disproportionate to the purpose” and an “excessive intrusion into the employees’ private sphere”. He added that employees had no way of escaping the surveillance.

After receiving the minutes of this visit, the Company wrote a letter in which it explained that distinction should be made between two types of locations filmed, depending on their economic and strategic sensitivity: the counters and the safe room on one hand, and other locations on the other. It also considered that employees were not filmed permanently since they could avoid the cameras' field of vision. The company also argued that the presence of certain cameras was justified in relation to the purpose.

For example, a camera positioned in the safe where one of the employees was stationed and where the company kept precious metals and physical securities. The company stressed that the room is locked for security reasons and that the camera made it possible to see if the employee was ""feeling unwell"". The company also explained that this is an ad hoc workstation, subject to patrols, which means that the employee working there was not filmed at all times.

Another example was given by the cameras placed upon the counters. The company explained that employees were only filmed from behind and that their hands, faces, private or professional equipment were not targeted. According to the company, the presence of these cameras was therefore necessary and proportionate to the aims pursued.

Finally, with regard to the surveillance of the public highway, the investigation showed, among other things, that buildings not belonging to the company were filmed. The company argued that this was necessary to effectively protect their building. The head of the investigation however considered this surveillance to be disproportionate.

Information on surveillance cameras

The investigation showed that data subjects were informed about the use of surveillance cameras by a pictogram and an old CNPD authorisation sticker at the entrance door and at a passageway closed to the public. According to the head of the investigation, this information was incomplete because it did not provide, among other things, the following elements: the retention period, the purposes of the processing, the right to rectification and erasure. The GDPR intranet section did not contain sufficient information either.

In its letter in response to the minutes of the visit, the company explained that the pictograms were the first step of a various steps information which included the GDPR intranet section and mandatory trainings on data privacy. The company also reported that it had initiated the replacement of the pictograms and would indicate the missing information in the future.

With regard to third parties, the agents noted that a sign was installed containing a camera image and the words ""locals under video surveillance"".) The company considered that informing third parties was not an absolute obligation under Article 13 (which states that it is not required when communication is impossible or would require disproportionate effort).

The investigation did not demonstrate the existence of such geo-location systems.","1. The case involves a covered entity (Company A) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

"The controller is Company A which was acting as building manager of a residence co-ownership. The data subjects are  Mr A and Mr B, some of the co-owners.

On 11 February 2019, the controller sent two emails to the other co-owners. The communication contained, among other things, the following data: the accounting situation of Mr. A and Mr. B vis-à-vis the co-ownership and their private addresses. They were intended to highlight the payment irregularities concerning the two.

The data subjects informed the controller that the disclosure amounted to a data breach and encouraged him to report it within 72 hours. They also requested access to their data and information on the processing operations. The company responded more than a month after these letters, without providing the requested information.

The data subject filed a complaint. On 4 October 2019, the Luxembourg DPA opened an investigation.

In his defense, the controller explained that under applicable national law, as a building manager, it was the cashier and accountant of the co-ownership and, as such, under the co-owners' supervision. For the co-owner to do so, it was crucial to disclose the debtors details. He therefore considered that it had to comply with a legal obligation and that the processing was therefore lawful under Article 6(1)(c). The controller also invoked Article 6(1)(f), explaining that it had a legitimate interest to the processing because it would be liable if it did not recover the debts of the co-ownership.","1.

"Virtue Integrated Elder Care Ltd (""VIEC""), the controller, operates and manages five nursing homes in Dublin, Ireland. On 15 August 2020, VIEC became aware through a report to their IT helpdesk that one of the users of their internal systems was being blocked from sending emails. The controller subsequently discovered that the email address of one of its managers had been subject to a phishing attack, and that emails had been rerouted to a third party Gmail account.

On 19 August 2019, VIEC notified the Irish DPA (the DPC) of a personal data breach. Based on initial analysis of the breach notification and subsequent documentation provided during the breach handling process, the DPC considered that the matter concerned a possible “breach of security potentially leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed” by VIEC. As a result, the DPC commenced an investigation.

In a commencement letter, the DPC informed VIEC that their inquiry would examine whether or not the company discharged its obligations in connection with the subject matter of the personal data breach and determine whether or not any provision(s) of data protection law had been violated by VIEC in that context.

The scope of the inquiry was stated to include the following. Firstly, the steps taken by VIEC to comply with the principle of integrity and confidentiality pursuant to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. Secondly, the technical and organisational measures taken to ensure security of processing pursuant to Article 32(1) GDPR. Thirdly, the ability of the controller to demonstrate ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability of personal data pursuant to Article 32(1)(b) GDPR. Fourth, the process employed by VIEC for regularly testing the effectiveness of measures for ensuring appropriate security pursuant to Article 32(1)(d) GDPR. Fifth, and finally, the ability of VIEC to demonstrate that it had assessed the risk to processing special category information.

As part of the investigation the security provider for VIEC, ‘Ortus’, conducted a report which determined that the most likely root cause of the breach was that the credentials of a user account at one of the nursing homes were captured on a fake website. The link to that fake website was likely received in a phishing email. The original email that delivered the malicious link in question was not identified by the security provider. The email account was thereby accessed by an unauthorised third party, using the captured credentials. This resulted in unauthorised access to stored emails, and allowed the bad actor to set up email forwarding of all inbound emails to a third party email account. In addition, this issue had been ongoing since 18 July 2020.

The DPC prepared an Inquiry Issues Paper to document the relevant facts of the case, and invited submissions from VIEC, in particular regarding any inaccuracies and/or incomplete facts. Outlining the mitigating factors to be considered, VIEC explained that the assigned DPO was aware of the requirement to report the breach within 72 hours and that this timeline had become exhausted by the time the DPO became aware of the breach. The DPO hastily notified the DPC of the breach and supplemented this notification with additional information. The DPC noted this is an example of good practice on the part of a controller in this regard. In another proposed mitigating factor, VIEC submitted that password for the affected account was reset and a forced logout was performed.

The controller also confirmed, among other things, that 213 data subjects had their personal data compromised, and that 129 of these residents had special category data compromised; 117 of these individuals had health data compromised and 12 had biometric data compromised.

On 11 November 2022 the DPC provided a draft decision to VIEC, and the controller was invited to make further submissions on the proposed infringements. In its response to the draft decision, VIEC asserted that it considered the proposals too excessive, and made a range of submissions in support of their position. VIEC stressed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on its ability to implement data security provisions. In particular, they explained that senior managers were redirected to frontline roles, at a time of increased regularity of phishing attacks.","1.

"The Italian DPA launched an investigation into the insurance broker Assiteca Spa (Assiteca), the controller, as part of the authorities planned inspection activities for 2022, and following a number of complaints. The investigation consisted of carrying out a simulated request for car insurance quotations on two websites operated by the company.

As a preliminary point, the company explained that the services on these two websites were previously implemented by 6Sicuro SpA, a company which merged into Assiteca in July 2021. At the time of the investigation, the two websites had separate IT systems and were undergoing re-engineering.

"Following the Schrems II ruling of 16 July 2020 (CJEU case C-311/18) the European Center for Digital Rights (noyb) lodged 101 complaints to several data protection authorities in the European Economic Area (EEA). All complaints concerned the use of Google Analytics or Facebook Connect on websites in the EEA.

In accordance with Article 80(1) GDPR, noyb lodged a complaint on 17 August 2020 with the Austrian DPA against Telenor ASA (the controller) for their use of Google Analytics on their website and alleged transfer of a data subject's personal data to the US in violation of Article 44 GDPR. The data subject provided the DPA with a HTTP Archive format (HAR) data of the website, i.e., a JSON-formatted archive file format for logging a web browser’s interaction with a website, as proof of US-transfers being made.

As per Article 4(16)(a) GDPR, Telenor’s main establishment is in Norway. Consequently, the Austrian DPA transferred the complaint to the Norwegian DPA in accordance with Article 56(1), who proceeded to investigate the case.

The controller informed the DPA that they in late August 2020 initiated a review project to assess relevant agreements in light of the Schrems II ruling. They found this to apply to their use of Google Analytics since the agreement was with Google as a US processor of their. With the Privacy Shield now invalidated, the controller entered into standard contractual clauses (SCCs) Module Two with Google on 12 August 2020 for data transfers to the US.

However, the controller did not carry out a thorough review of potential third country legislation (a ""transfer impact assessment""), as it, according to information from Google, was not possible to determine the exact location of processing. The decision, however, refers to a statement by Google informing that Google Analytics data is stored in the US.

The parties still agreed supplementary measures. First, Google has established policies and procedures and a team of qualified lawyers for handling authority requests for user data. Second, Google offers and the controller implemented the Anonymize IP feature and, finally, the controller had applied a redaction script on the website to prevent personal data unintentionally being shared with Google.

Google Analytics was implemented on the website until 15 January 2021 and collected, until then, online identifiers, including cookie identifiers, IP addresses, device identifiers and client identifiers. The controller had enabled the IP anonymization feature and therefore argued that the identifiers listed above could not be regarded as personal data as this feature had ""severed any link to an invididual"". Google had also informed them that it would not be possible to extract such data following a potential legally binding authority request. In conclusion, the controller thus argued that the only personal data collected by Google Analytics and subsequently processed by them were IP addresses.","1.

"This case concerns A&G Couriers, a company providing courier services, (the “Controller”) which engaged a third party IT software contractor (“Contractor”) to undertake a ""Brexit project"". This project was aimed at providing the UK tax authority (Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs – HMRC) with access to their internal reporting system to facilitate declarations of duty and VAT.

The Contractor immediately began facilitating access to the reports for external review and, while these changes to the system were being made, the server which housed all the data became exposed to the public internet. It was suggested by the Controller that – due to insufficient checks on security patches, user restrictions and access controls by the Contractor – the configuration of the affected server was implemented incorrectly, and the IP address of the affected server was inadvertently.

For a total of two days, the servers, which housed in total, the unencrypted personal data of 446,143 data subjects, were publicly available. This included their names, home addresses, email addresses and mobile numbers. The Controller further clarified that each of these categories of personal data may not be fully present in each record affected by the personal data breach, since the data collected is client specific and not all fields are mandatory.

In addition, an unknown individual gained access to the exposed server and exfiltrated the personal information pertaining to a large number of data subjects. The hacker was able to access the records of 10,000 data subjects in total.

In submissions to the DPC, the Controller outlined their account of the incident and made a number of arguments in its defence. Firstly, the Controller asserted that, depending on the specific data, it was in some cases a controller, and in others a processor, and so the duty to implement appropriate measures was not placed upon them in all circumstances.

Secondly, the controller stated that the servers contained some or all of the following categories of personal data: names, home addresses, email addresses and mobile numbers (as dependent on client requirements). The Controller submitted that, in an objective assessment, the risks posed by the Controller’s processing at the time of the personal data breach involved low to moderate risks, both in likelihood and severity, to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. It is admitted that there was a significant quantity of personal data related to a large number of data subjects processed and stored for a period of thirty days by the Controller, however, this personal data may be considered at the lower end of the scale in terms of sensitivity.","1.

"This case concerns the Friuli Centrale University Health Authority, the controller, which (upon instruction from the Friuli Venezia Giulia Regional Council) instructed GPs to validate a list of patients compiled for the supposed purpose of “statistical stratification”. These patients, the data subjects, had been previously identified by the Health Authority, according to its own (unknown) criteria, as being in complex and comorbid conditions and therefore at a high risk of major complications from covid-19 infections. The personal information processed included details of therapies, pathological status, family addresses, living conditions/habits and the procedure for collecting this information imposed upon GPs a disclosure of their patient’s health data without the chance to check if consent had been obtained.

The Italian DPA commenced a preliminary investigation in which they requested specific information from the controller concerning: the initiatives taken to ensure the data was processed lawfully; the purpose of the processing; the methods for obtaining informed consent; a description of whether the data was special category health data or anonymised data; and the impact assessment carried out.

The controller responded to the request by stating, firstly, that the activity is based on a legal provision related to the current state of emergency. Secondly, the three lawful bases for processing (depending on the type of data) are: Article 9(2)(h) GDPR (necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine); Article 9(2)(i) GDPR (for reasons of public interest in the area of public health); and Article 9(2)(g) GDPR (for reasons of substantial public interest). Thirdly, the use of an algorithm was only applied to the data of those who had consented to extraction for this purpose. Finally, that they did not deem it necessary to carry out an impact assessment, as they did not perceive a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

"Commify Italia s.r.l. (controller) offers to business customers the service available at the Skebby platform (www.skebby.it) by which text messages can be sent via a web application or through application programming interfaces.

The Italian DPA carried out inspection activities at the controller place of business on several occasions: in 2018 as a result of a data breach notified by a client of the controller. In 2019 as a result of additional documentation provided by the controller and a complaint from which it emerged the potential unlawful storage of the content of text messages sent through the platform. Precisely with regard to the lawfulness of the procedures adopted regarding the storage of the content of text messages sent, in 2021 the DPO of a client company requested the intervention of the Italian DPA. As a result, the Italian DPA carried out a further inspection to verify the functioning of the platform.

The inspection revealed that:

•	The controller stored in its systems the content of messages sent by its customers, which also included special categories of personal data (such as, reservations for health services, messages sent by political parties to their members). The controller justified this retention on the grounds that the content of the messages was to be considered traffic data in accordance with Article 121(1-bis)(h) of Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003 (the Italian Data Protection Code) with the consequent obligation to retain them pursuant to Articles 123 and 132 of the Code.

•	With regard to the technical and organisational measures taken by the controller, it appeared that the traffic data (including the content of text messages) were stored in the controller's systems without any physical or logical distinction according to the purpose of retention (e.g. crime prevention and prosecution, billing, making the text available to the customer for consultation). Consequently, there was also no differentiation of retention periods according to each purpose. Access to these systems was possible for authorised personnel by means of one-factor authentication (e.g. username and password). The controller had not adopted any system for keeping track of the operations performed on the systems by persons acting under its authority. Finally, the transmission of data between the computer systems of some customers and the controller took place using insecure communication protocols (http), thus exposing the transmitted data to risks of unlawful acquisition or manipulation.

•	The controller performed automated checks on the content of messages sent by its customers in order to prevent fraudulent use of the service. To this end, it used preventive analysis systems by means of detection algorithms (URL, domain, keywords), blocking the sending of messages if potential fraudulent content was detected in the alias (alphanumeric string that identifies the sender instead of the telephone number), or in the text (e.g. in the case of links not expressly requested by the customer or for which the customer was not authorised, as well as in the presence of prohibited keywords).","1.

"The Padua University Hospital notified the Italian DPA of a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR. The hospital accidentally sent to all the patients involved in a clinical trial an email in which the patients' email addresses were not put in BCC (blind carbon copy) but in CC (carbon copy), unintentionally making known the email addresses of all patients waiting for heart transplant.

In order to remedy the violation and reduce its negative effects on the people involved, instructions were given to inform each individual concerned about the mistake, urging them delete the email previously sent and not to use the email addresses of other recipients.

The Italian DPA investigated whether the processing of personal data of the email recipients was in violation of the basic principles set out in Article 5 GDPR.

The hospital argued that the seriousness of the potential impact for the interested parties was average, considering that the health data - the existence of a scheduled heart transplant - were isolated and common to all the interested parties and not accompanied by any other sensitive data. Furthermore, out of 19 email addresses only 7 were recognizable, while the other 12 were not immediately traceable to the account holder. The hospital further argued that the violation was partly due to the COVID – 19 pandemic and the shortage of staff. Finally, the hospital stated that the author of the violation certainly did not benefit from the violation and no complaints were received from the data subjects following breach notification to the data subjects.

The hospital also provided for the technical and organizational measures to be carried out in order to prevent data breaches in the future.

"Between 21 May and 14 June 2021, Argon Medical Devices, Inc. (the controller) experienced a cyber security incident. It was discovered on 14 June 2021 when the controller's US Senior Vice President of Human Resources noticed missing emails in his inbox.

Upon further investigation, the controller determined that it had been subject to a business email compromise, perpetrated through an internal platform by an unauthorized third party, most likely through a phishing email. Consequently, the Director of Global IT Security put in place several cyber security measures, which appear to have contained the incident on 14 June 2021.

On 15 June 2021, they reported the incident to the local FBI Cybercrime Unit in the US and commenced an internal investigation to determine the extent and nature of the incident.

On 19 July 2021 they realized that personal data such as salary and benefits of all of their (20) European employees, including one in Norway, had been affected, and proceeded to assess whether the incident was reportable under Article 33(1) GDPR.

On 24 September 2021, after concluding that the incident was indeed reportable, the controller hired a Norwegian law firm to notify the Norwegian DPA. Since the controller has several establishments in the EU/EEA, they also sent similar breach notifications to several other European supervisory authorities.

In this regard, they acknowledged that “Argon in the US [i.e., Argon Medical Devices, Inc.] is the data controller with respect to the personal data connected to this Incident”. They also stated that their ""European head office resides in Switzerland, and only its Swiss establishment enjoys a power of direction and control over its other EU/EEA establishments. Therefore, Argon does not have a main establishment in the EU/EEA for the purposes of Article 4(16) GDPR.""

Consequently, the DPA concluded that the cooperation mechanism and procedure set out in Article 56(1) GDPR and Article 60 GDPR did not apply in this case and, thus, pursuant to Article 55(1) GDPR, the DPA was competent to perform the tasks assigned to them and exercise the powers conferred on them by the GDPR in relation to the personal data breach notification. The controller did not dispute this in their written representations.

On 4 October 2021 the DPA sent the controller a request for further information and asked them to, in particular, clarify why they concluded that the incident was reportable only on 21 September 2021.

The controller held that they had acted ""without undue delay, to notify the supervisory authorities within 72 hours"". Their main claim was that it was necessary to investigate the incident in order to determine if it was reportable or not, which they were only able to conclude on 21 September 2021.

On 31 January 2022, the DPA sent the controller an advance notification of their intention to fine them NOK 2 500 000 for having violated Article 33(1) GDPR. Despite several exchanges where the controller continued to argue they had indeed sent the notification in time, the DPA upheld their conclusion and issued the final decision on 8 March 2023.

The controller then appealed the decision to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board, where it's currently pending.","1. The case involves a covered entity (Argon Medical Devices, Inc.) and an individual (their European employees) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

"The data subject was the victim of a crime that was being covered by the media in Spain. During the case trial, the the data subject gave a testimony reporting the details of the crime. Telecinco, the controller, and other media channels, released the original audio without distorting the data subject's voice.

The DPA initiated an investigation after a complaint was filed and ordered the controller to remove the data subject's voice from their website. In response, the controller argued that the mere hypothetical possibility of singling out an individual is not sufficient to consider the person as identifiable. In their view, taking into account all the means that may reasonably be used by the controller or any other person, such a possibility does not exist or is either negligible. Therefore, the voice cannot be considered as personal data. It also claimed that the original source of the data was the Court, which distributed the recording to all media channels without applying any prior voice distortion or giving any instructions in this regard. Finally, it alleged that coverage of crimes is of public interest and that restricting the publication would infringe their right to freedom of expression.","1.

"Hackers invaded the information systems of the accommodation service provider Forenom, the controller. They gained access to a database containing approximately 165.000 personal details of the controller's customers. After receiving complaints from affected data subjects, the Finnish DPA  launched investigations to ascertain the circumstances of the data leak. When asked to comment on the facts, the controller argued that the type of data collected depended on the group to which the person belonged, whether tenant, owner or company contacts. As for the data retention period, landlord and tenant information were kept for 10 years from the end of the tenancy or contract, while customer relationship management data were kept for 5 years since the last activity. According to the controller, long-term apartment rentals play a significant role in its business. Therefore, they found it necessary to keep the data to respond to eventual compensation claims that, based on the national Accounting Act, can be made within a 10-year time limit.

"During a recruitment procedure, an employee of the Bank of Italy (the controller) accidentally sent an email to 500 participants, where the email address of each of the candidates was clearly visible. By using the carbon copy (CC) instead of the blind carbon copy (BCC) option, the employee disclosed the email addresses of the job applicants to one another.

The email in question contained general information including a feedback request. The employee did not inform the office in charge of data protection and the participants did not raise any complaints. Consequently, in the immediate aftermath of the event, the Bank could not activate a data breach procedure, which provides for the involvement of the DPO and other staff members responsible for compliance with the GDPR and the relevant national legislation.

When the controller became aware of the breach, it sent another email to the job applicants instructing them to delete the email containing the visible addresses and not to use them or disclose them to third parties. The controller also argued that the event was an isolated one and it did not reflect the organisational measures that the Bank of Italy applies to the protection of personal data.

"The Spanish DPA launched an investigation against the controller, owner of a pornographic website, due to possible processing of personal data and profiling of minors under fourteen years of age. During the investigations, several violations of the GDPR were found.

Firstly, the controller denied the processing of minors' personal data, except for basic contact information in a specific section where the user must register with a username, password and email. However, their privacy policy indicated otherwise. It actually prohibited minors under 14 years of age from providing their data and required parental consent for those under 18. Similarly, the controller denied performing any profiling and stated that their cookies analyze visits primarily to see where users navigate on their pages. However, in their privacy policy they admit collecting IP addresses, names, email addresses and other data to generate a user profile. This profile includes: location, gender, age, sexual preferences and media content.

Secondly, the DPA observed that when a user entered the website for the first time, a pop-up window asked them to declare that they were of legal age. However, by clicking anywhere outside the confirmation area access to the website was allowed without any restrictions. Personal data, such as name and email, were collected when the user registered on the site without any age verification. Registered users could then access and share videos, see profiles of other users and share their own profiles.

Thirdly, by accepting the legal notice on cookies, users implicitly accepted their use and there was no option to access the website while rejecting the cookies.

Fourthly, the DPA verified that the controller was processing data for purposes other than those established in their privacy policy which stated that data would be shared with ""tax and accounting consultancy (in case of purchase through the website)."" However, in the activity records submitted to the DPA, they also included the processing of data to maintain a contractual relationship with the user.

Fifthly, there was no information in their privacy policy as to the retention period, but the controller stated that personal data obtained from non-registered users were kept for 365 days for statistical and marketing purposes, while personal data obtained from registered users were kept for an indefinite period. Moreover, the controller was not able to present proper records of the processing activities nor a general description of the technical and organizational security measures adopted.

First, the company's scooters were equipped with electronic boxes containing a SIM card and a GPS geo-location system. This allowed location data to be collected every 30 seconds when the scooter was active and every 15 minutes when it was not. This data was collected by the company for the following purposes: detecting and handling traffic offenses, handling customer complaints, user support (in order to call for help in case of a user's fall), claims and theft management.

Second, the controller used 15 processors on the basis of contracts that did not contain all the information required by the GDPR. For example, one of the contracts did not mention the processor's obligation to make available to the controller all the information to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down. Another contract did not mention the purpose of the data processing or its duration.

The data subject, namely the employee using that company car, filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, indicating that he was not aware of the existence of the GPS tracker and that the controller did not inform him about the processing purposes, applicable legal grounds, and retention periods. Also, the data subject stated that the personal data collected through the GPS tracker were not only processed for the purpose of monitoring the company car.

Following this complaint, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. It revealed that the data controller processed the personal data collected through the GPS tracker, without providing the data subject with complete information in relation to such processing activities. Also, it was found that the controller processed the data for various purposes and that it collected location data outside of working hours.

The investigation also showed that the controller stored the data after the expiration of 30-day storage period, provided by Article 5 of Law No. 190/2018, without being able to prove that exceeding the 30-day period was based on justified reasons, as required under the law.","1.

"The Italian DPA investigated the Italian company Problem Solving s.r.l. (the Company) after having adopted a decision against the telephone company Vodafone Italia S.p.A. in November 2020. The DPA made an information request to the Company to which the Company replied on 5 November 2021.

The Company acted as a telesales partner of Vodafone, and acquired lists containing contact details from third party providers to further communicate the lists to Vodafone. The agreement between Vodafone and the Company was about the execution of outbound and inbound call management services for the promotion of commercial campaigns. The agreement did not mention the activity of acquiring lists of contact details on behalf of Vodafone.

The Company acquired contact lists containing approximately 4,300,000 personal data and communicated them to Vodafone between 2019 and 2020. The lists were acquired from third parties, Ad-Opera s.r.l. and BR Pharma s.r.l. The initial list provider was Ad-Opera s.r.l. which the Company chose to replace in 2020 with BR Pharma s.r.l. The latter was deemed more fit to raise the quality level of the Company’s activities.

During the investigation, the Company claimed that it did not have any decision-making role on the use of any lists and viewed Vodafone as the controller. Vodafone, it argued, only allowed the use of the lists after a rigorous verification procedure. The Company argued that it uploaded the contact details on the ""Vodafone Deduplica Liste"" system, in order to obtain ""validation"" from Vodafone and to act in compliance with the will and purposes of Vodafone which the Company held was the controller. The Company also highlighted that it did not proceed to any further use of the lists of contact details in question.

The DPA established that the company acquired approximately 4,300,000 personal data from Ad-Opera and BR Pharma, which the Company then had communicated to Vodafone for the purpose of carrying out promotional campaigns. The DPA considered this as carrying out a transfer between independent controllers.

The DPA initiated the proceedings against the Company on 11 March 2022, in which it challenged the Company for several violations. First, (i) violation of Article 13 GDPR, by not informing the data subjects included in the Ad-Opera and Br Pharma’s lists about the data sharing with Vodafone Second, infringement of Articles 5(1)(a), 6 and 7, for having disclosed the data referred to in point (i) above without the data subjects’ prior consent.

The Company then submitted a defence statement and requested a hearing.

The Company had provided information notices of the third party list providers to the DPA which the DPA had analysed. During the hearing, the Company provided a new information notice and exhibited e-mails with Vodafone. The Company argued that on the basis of the new information notice and the e-mail exchange, it was clear Vodafone had acknowledged its role of being the sole controller.

The Company argued that it had always acted as Vodafone's intermediary and processor, even during the phase of the acquisition of the lists of personal data. It also referred to the content of the EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor under the GDPR, highlighting that such concepts are ""functional rather than formal"". Also during the hearing, the Company highlighted its constant attention to the aspects related to the protection of personal data, with constant verifications that it always brought to Vodafone's attention.

The Company saw that the processing of personal data for the purpose of acquiring new personal data lists was part of the complex of processing operations aimed at the promotional contact of potential customers, processing for which Vodafone was unquestionably the sole controller. The Company represented that it carried out the activities only in the interest of Vodafone, without any autonomous business assessment.","1.

"A news report revealed that the flight attendants working for Icelandair were required to evaluate each other at work. This led the Icelandic DPA to open an investigation on the compliance of that mechanism with GDPR. On 19 May 2022, the DPA informed Icelandair of the investigation and invited it to provide explanation.

Icelandair explained that it ran an app called Crew App containing a possibility to evaluate the performance of colleagues. It works in the following way: 45 minutes after landing, the app announces that the performance evaluation is open. Flight attendants can then submit evaluation for 48 hours. This evaluation includes a grade from 1 to 5 with a written justification and text boxes where it is possible to enter text. The employees can consult their own average evaluation in the program only if they participated in performance evaluation of others.

The company explained that the purpose of the evaluation was to make employees aware of their performance. It also argued that the collective agreement between Icelandair and the Flight Attendants Association of Iceland stated among other things that performance must be taken into account when offering promotions and management positions. Therefore, regarding the legal basis, Icelandair stated (1) to have a legitimate interest in the performance evaluation and (2) that it is necessary to perform a contractual obligation arising from the collective agreement with the Flight Attendants Association. Finally, the company stated that the processing met the transparency requirements: the staff received a detailed introduction to use the app and could request access to their data under Article 15 GDPR.

The company also believed that it was not obliged to carry out a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 GDPR due to the nature of the processing: assessment and grading. It considered that this processing could not be seen as systematic or on a large scale of special categories of personal data since the data were provided only on a voluntary basis, whenever the employees decided to enter it.","1.

The DPA received several notifications in which clients and employees of the controller complained about cameras recording image and sound in all premises (offices, treatment rooms, corridors, reception) at its headquarters.

The DPA launched an official investigation on 19 October 2021 and carried out an on-site visit on 20 October 2021. The main issues arising from the very detailed investigation can be summarized as follows:

First, the cameras were monitoring the room where the staff eats, the training rooms and customer treatment rooms (implying that clients were often seen in incomplete clothing). The purpose of this processing was however not clearly defined nor communicated.

Second, the controller explained that only a few specific people had access to the recordings. However, the on-site visit showed that the camera images were also seen by the sales manager, who used them to check that the staff was communicating properly with the clients. The recordings were available on a computer in an unlocked room. To access them, one could click on a shortcut and enter a username which was written on a piece of paper stuck to the monitor.

Third, all clients had to fill in and sign a consultation form which mentioned the placement of cameras for the purpose of protecting clients and staff. It however did not mention the recording of audio. The investigation also showed that there was no mention of the cameras in the privacy notice in force.

Fourth, the controller stored health data in the client database, including Covid vaccination status, pregnancy, and sicknesses.

Fifth, the controller stated that the signature of the consultation form constituted a consent to the processing of their data for a marketing purpose. Later, the controller held that this processing was based on legitimate interest, and then in a further contradictory declaration, it stated that it did not use client data for such purposes","1.

"The controller – Ediscom S.p.A. – was a marketing company whose business consisted in contacting potential customers on behalf of third vendors through sms, emails and automated calls. In order to conduct this activity, the company made use of an extensive database including contact details of more than 21 million people. Personal data were collected both directly by Ediscom and by third parties. In general, Ediscom acknowledged to act as a controller. However, in some cases, Ediscom rented databases from third parties with an aim of monetising them. Although costs and profits were shared, Ediscom considered itself a processor on behalf of the owners of such databases.

Ediscom regularly received withdrawals of consent and erasure requests. As Ediscom relied on several databases with partial overlap of data, it usually put these requests in blacklists in order to avoid to reimport the same data from another source – and use them again. Whenever it considered to operate as a processor, Ediscom notified the original controller about erasure or withdrawal of consent requests.

Some data subjects claimed to have objected to the processing for marketing purposes. However, they still received calls and messages from Ediscom. In the context of these complaints, the Italian DPA started a broader investigation about the Ediscom’s business practices. The investigation concerned both the websites used by the controller to directly collect personal data and personal data disclosed to Ediscom by third parties.

On several websites managed by the Ediscom, users were invited to take part to lotteries or to subscribe to cooking or health newsletters. Theoretically, users could choose whether the Ediscom was allowed to use and share their data for marketing purposes. In practice, the supervisory authority identified numerous GDPR violations.

"The controller - an individual - installed cameras in a public toilet. The system had a sensor that activated cameras and started recording as soon as a person entered the monitored area. A criminal investigation started against the controller. When asked why he decided to install the cameras, the controller claimed to have a “technical interest”: indeed, they needed to test the cameras. They specifically targeted public toilets because this decision had “a certain appeal of the illicit”.

Notified by the police in the context of the criminal proceeding, the Austrian DPA opened a second investigation.

The controller claimed to have erased the data and not to have disclosed the data to third parties. Moreover, the controller pointed out that people appearing in the video recordings were not identifiable.

"The case initiated from a complaint made by a data subject who filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA requesting the DPA to declare that a controller - a company providing accommodation services - within the neighbouring property unlawfully processes personal data with its surveillance camera systems (CCTV). The data subject requested the DPA to 1) prohibit the controller from monitoring the data subject's property with its CCTV systems, and 2) to order the controller to terminate the unlawful recordings.

The DPA extended the scope of the investigation (ex officio) against the controller. The DPA investigated all processing activities carried out by the controller with its CCTV systems and conducted an on-site inspection to the controller's property. The controller was using two CCTV systems that were identified within the investigation as Camera system No. 1 (consisting of 4 analogue cameras only providing live image) and Camera system No. 2 (consisting of 4 IP cameras recording image and audio) for which the recordings were said to be stored for three days by the controller.

The Camera system No. 1 showed views of the parking area within the property of the controller, a view from the gate to the building and to the reception area, and a small part of the backyard of the property, with a pavement leading to the reception area. The DPA noted that there were no recreational facilities located in these areas. The controller stated that the purposes of the CCTV in Camera sytem No. 1 were: 1) the protection of persons and property, 2) to detect possible infringements, 3) to catch a perpetrator in the act, and 4) to prevent infringing acts. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing.

With regard to Camera system No. 2 showed views of: 1) a dining room, 2) a panoramic jacuzzi on the terrace - which previously showed a view of the data subject's property, but at the time of the DPA's on-site investigation, the controller had modified the angle view of the camera away from the data subject's property - 3) a patio, and 4) a reception desk.  These cameras were motion-activated, recorded images, and some of them were placed with an angle of view to areas where the persons not only pass through but also rest and dine. Regardless of the DPA's request, the controller did not present any previous cases justifying the necessity for the use of the CCTV. The DPA considered that it was relevant whether any events had taken place in the past which would justify the placement of the cameras, as the data processing was more extensive compared to Camera system No 1. With regard to the previous monitoring of the data subject's property, the controller argued that it had had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f), because it had legitimate interests for property protection purposes as it had accused the data subject’s husband for vandalism towards the fence separating the two properties.","1.

"Following a citizen’s inquiry, the Danish DPA initiated an investigation regarding a medical institute’s (Statens Serum Institut or SSI) fulfillment of the obligation to provide information under Article 14(1) to 14(4) GDPR with regard to certain operations carried out by the SSI.

The SSI receives and analyses biological samples taken from patients (for example blood samples) for diagnostic analysis purposes which is done as part of the institute's exercise of authority pursuant to Section 222 of the Danish Health Act. In addition, SSI processes other information about the person (e.g. the person’s name and ID number). After a diagnostic analysis has been carried out, often resulting excess biological material is stored in Denmark's National Biobank for future research purposes. The SSI argued that the exception under Article 14(5)(b) of said information obligations applies, as informing would require a disproportionately large effort in the form of large administrative and financial costs. The SSI's laboratory information system is over 20 years old and does not currently support automatic notifications which means that the SSI would need to inform individuals manually.

Additionally, the SSI viewed that the concerned persons’ interests were covered by making general information about the collection available online on their websites.

"In February 2021, the Italian Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) informed the Italian DPA that two related companies, MAS S.R.L. and MAS S.R.L.S., were engaging in door-to-door marketing and ilegally using personal data to promote and offer contracts with electric companies.

Initially, the DPA opened an investigation only against the two companies. However, the investigations revealed a complex system of direct and indirect contractual relationships, with two companies in the energy sector as final recipients of said marketing services: HERA COMM and ENEL ENERGIA.

Operating as part of that system, MAS S.R.L.S. first bought personal data bases from an Italian and a Spanish company and also from an unidentified vendor on Facebook. Then, together with MAS S.R.L., it processed these data for door-to-door marketing on behalf of the electric companies, without telling consumers that they were mere intermediaries. Additionally, the companies did not tell them how they collected their personal data.

Moreover, MAS S.R.L. and MAS S.R.L.S. shared the collected personal data with telemarketing companies SESTA IMPRESA and ARNIA, that further processed the data for telephone advertising. During the investigation, no proof of consumer consent was provided.

The DPA also found that SESTA IMPRESA got the credentials to access ENEL's infromation systems and shared them with ARNIA. In turn, ARNIA used these credentials to upload the signed contracts into the system without authorization from ENEL. None of the telemarketing companies had a written contract with ENEL appointing them as processors.

Although ARNIA had been appointed as a processor by SESTA in 2019, none of the other companies had signed data processing  or joint controllership agreements. They were also not appointed as processors or sub-processors by other intermediaries nor by the final customers HERA COMM and ENEL.

The DPA also verified that the marketing activities involved a large number of consumers as ARNIA uploaded 260.000 contracts between 2018 and 2022.  While ARNIA presented a purely procedural defense, the other investigated companies decided to not defend themselves at all.","1.

"Background

Following a complaint filed by noyb, in January 2019, as well as, complaints from the Netherlands and Denmark against Spotify AB (Spotify) regarding the right of access under Article 15 GDPR, the Swedish DPA initiated an ex officio investigation on whether Spotify’s general practices for handling access requests comply with the GDPR.

After 3 years of inactivity from the DPA, noyb sought remedy under Article 78(2) GDPR from the Stockholm Administrative Court, which eventually sided with noyb. As a result, the DPA has now finally issued a decision on noyb’s complaint, as well as, the other complaints filed against Spotify simultaneously with the DPA’s ex officio investigation. Since Spotify operates in several EU Member States, the DPA applied the cooperation and consistency mechanisms set out in Chapter VII GDPR.

The complaint brought by noyb was identified as ‘complaint 2’, and the complaint from the Netherlands as ‘complaint 1’. The complaint from Denmark was eventually rejected, because the investigation of the case did not show that Spotify has failed in its handling of the complainant's request for access.

Facts on Spotify’s general procedures for handling access requests (ex officio investigation)

With regard to Spotify's general practices on handling access requests, Spotify provides information required by Article 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) GDPR via an online function. When Spotify provides a copy of personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR it includes a file called ""Read me first"" to each copy of data with a link to the information.

Moreover, Spotify provides a copy of personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR by dividing the information to three different layers: “Type 1” that consists profile information, “Type 2” that consists technical log files linked to the data subjects' user IDs and “Type3” that consists information specifically requested by a data subject. Spotify provides the information in JSON format.

Facts on individual complaints that triggered the DPA’s ex officio investigation

Complaint 1

The complainant had made an access request, on 27 May 2018, under Article 15 GDPR to Spotify, and contacted Spotify later again, as the complainant themself noticed that the information provided by Spotify was incomplete. Spotify thereafter provided the remaining data. The data was provided to the complainant in JSON format. Some of the technical log files were provided encrypted which Spotify, during the DPA's investigation, claimed to have been a mistake.

The complainant argued that 1) Spotify did not provide the personal data in due time under Article 12(3) GDPR and 2) that the data was not provided in an intelligible form as required by Article 12(1) GDPR.

Complaint 2

The complainant made an access request, on 10 Oct 2018, under Article 15 GDPR to Spotify by using Spotify's ""Download your data"" feature that provided the ""Type 1"" information. The ""Type 1"" data was provided to the complainant in JSON format. The complainant did not return to Spotify for further information.

It was argued by the complainant that 1) Spotify had not provided all of the personal data that Spotify processes about them, 2) Spotify had not provided any of the information as required by Article 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) GDPR, and that 3) Spotify had not provided the personal data in an intelligible form as required by Article 12(1) GDPR. At the time of the complainant’s request, Spotify had not yet implemented its practice - mentioned above - where Spotify includes the “Read me first” file to its responses to access requests.

"After procedure 7.2020, in which a decision established a deadline for TIM, as the controller, to implement a series of corrective measures, the Italian DPA received several complaints relating to issues already subject to the aforementioned decision. These complaints referred mainly to the following:

1) unsolicited advertising telephone calls, text messages and emails (often repetitive);

2) missed or late response to access requests;

3) publication of personal numbers in telephone directories;

4) unavailability of privacy information during the purchases on the controller's website;

5) a possible data breach.

The Italian DPA grouped together the complaints of a similar and repeated nature and opened a wide investigation against the controller.

1) As for the unsolicited phone calls, the controller denied that data subjects were contacted by its ""commercially active sales force"" and stated that it did not recognize the calling numbers. It also claimed that, before using personal data obtained from external providers, it verifies that data subjects gave their consent by carrying out a test on a random sample of names included in the database. According to the controller, the data from data subjects who appear to have denied their consent  for marketing activities are deleted.

2) With regard to personal data access requests, the controller presented different justifications. In some cases, it claimed to be unaware of the access request or that it was not possible to authenticate the user. In others, it admitted not having answered them or having answered them only partially. About the requests relating to unwanted calls, it claimed that it did not provide more information because it did not recognize the calling numbers as its own numbers.

3) Similarly, the controller presented several arguments in relation to telephone directories. In general, it stated that its customers received a copy of the contractual conditions in which they consented to the publication of their personal data in telephone directories. However, it recognized that there was a misalignment between its systems, which hindered the processing of consent withdrawals. In this regard, the controller informed that the anomaly was resolved and that confidentiality requests are being adequately addressed. In other specific cases, it argued that the the responsability was exclusively on the publisher of the public directories.

4) Concerning the complaints on the unavailability of the privacy information, the controller once again attributed the fact to a temporary anomaly in the system. This anomaly - TIM said - was already resolved and customers could then access the privacy policy before the conclusionof online purchases, expressing their consent for purposes other than the performance of the contract.

5) Finally, with reference to the data breach, the controller alleged that it received no reports or comlplaints on the matter. However, from the checks carried out on its commercial systems, it emerged that some data subjects were associated with the tax code other persons and mistakenly received communications containing their personal data such as name, surname, tax code and telephone number.","1.

"The Controller is the operator of a platform for short-term car rental: “CityBee”. It was made aware by another company that provides cyber-security services, that CityBee’s customer data of 110,302 users was published on the website RaidForums.com. The controller notified the DPA, who conducted an investigation.

The DPA found out that the personal data was retrieved from an unprotected database backup BACPAC file (DB file), and contained the following: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, personal identification number, driving license number, type of payment card and the last four digits of the number, the expiration date of the payment card, and the user identifier (token) in Braintree (software for online payments). This DB file was created on 27 February 2018, and access to the file was suspended on 16 February 2021. Hence, the DPA concluded that the personal data breach existed for this entire period.

The DPA found that a number of organisational and technical security measures were missing: there was no competent person responsible for security and risk management, no logs were kept of access and changes to the DB files, the DB file was stored unencrypted, the passwords in the DB file had a weak encryption (SHA-1) and easy to retrieve by persons with technical knowledge, and users could make passwords that did not comply with the requirements as set out in the company’s IT security policy.

"A ""ShareArt"" project was implemented in the Municipal Art Collections of Palazzo D'Accursio in Bologna in order to obtain information on the characteristics of the visitors and on the ways in which they interacted with some works of art. The project followed a collaboration agreement between ENEA and the Bologna Museums Institution which is an instrumental body of the Municipality of Bologna (the “Municipality”).

The information was collected with a system using a face detection algorithm (“ShareArt”) developed by the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (“ENEA”). The face detection algorithm was based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect faces in the images. Visitors were informed about the system with a notice at the ticket office that stated, inter alia, that the algorithm ""does not imply face recognition”.

An Italian civil rights organisation (Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights) submitted a report to the Italian DPA in relation to the used ShareArt system. The report stated, inter alia, that ShareArt, using a camera, automatically detected faces looking in the direction of art work, contextually acquiring a series of information relating to behaviour when observing works of art. The report highlighted that only very few signs were in place to indicate to the museum visitors that the system was used: small black cameras attached to the walls and a disclaimer at the ticket office.

Following the report, the DPA launched an investigation and requested for information from the Municipality as well as ENEA. The parties argued, inter alia, that the system does not involve the collection and processing of data relating to identified or identifiable natural persons. Moreover, the Municipality viewed that it did not have any kind of role with regard to the data processing.","1.

"Several Danish citizens had discovered that by logging into their online bank via MitID - a digital identity solution - they gained access to other citizens' accounts. Three different banks that were using the MitID solution within their online banking services each reported a data security breach to the Danish DPA.

Following the reports from the banks, the Danish DPA initiated an investigation on the matter.

The MitID solution is owned in a joint partnership between the financial sector and the public sector, specifically the Digitalisation Agency. The Digitalisation Agency is the data controller for the processing of personal data in MitID.

When the 'MitID' solution is used and it has verified that the user who wants to log in to a service is who they claim to be, an authentication response is generated which is then sent to a broker (the company that conveys the authentication response - in this case the Signaturgruppen, the data controller for the broker solution). The broker forwards the information to the service provider whose service the user wishes to access (which in this case were the banks in question).

According to the Digitalisation Agency, the error was found to be due to the fact that login requests to the same online bank within milliseconds could in special cause MitID to issue a token for another session. This error could have been avoided if the broker (Signaturgruppen) had validated the citizens' login with a technology called ”Broker Security Context”. The Digitalisation Agency had recommended to the brokers implementing the solution to perform the Broker Security Context, but had not made it a requirement.

Signaturgruppen were recommended by the The Digital Agency to perform validation of the tokens that are generated in connection to the log in requests which the brokers receive from MitID. Nevertheless, Signaturgruppen had used the Broker Security Context in a different way than what was described in the recommendation.","1.

"A registered user of an email service (the data subject) requested their data from the email service provider (the controller) in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format pursuant to Article 20 GDPR. The controller denied the request, stating that the data subject could export their emails one by one in an '.eml format'. Furthermore, the controller argued that it is still uncertain whether Article 20 GDPR applies to emails. The controller stated to be in the process of developing an import/export -tool. The tool was not yet available to all users, at the time. The data subject requested the Finnish DPA to investigate whether the controller had fulfilled its obligations under Article 20 GDPR.

The DPA requested an explanation from the controller aiming to understand how the controller facilitated the right to data portability in relation to the email service. Furthermore, the DPA sought to determine whether the controller treated this right differently based on whether the user paid for the service or not.

According to the controller, their intention was to provide data import and export tools for all users. However, due to technical reasons, such as encryption technologies, users had to perform these tasks manually themselves. The controller said to have been working on an automated tool to facilitate mass data export. However, they explained that they were unable to offer it to the entire user base due to technical and development-related challenges. Initially, access to the tool was limited to users with a subscription as a beta version, allowing for testing its stability and functionality on a progressively larger scale.

Following the DPA's request, the tool was made available to free plan customers as well. The version released to them was the same one that had been available to paid customers for over a year.

The data subject argued that the controller intentionally delayed fulfilling its obligations under the GDPR until an investigation by the supervisory authority would be initiated. In the meantime, controller had been generating revenue by charging users for the implementation of rights guaranteed by the GDPR, resulting in financial gain for at least two years.","1.

"Bonnier News AB (now Expressen Lifestyle), the controller, is a media company in Sweden. The Bonnier group processed their customers' data for, among other reasons, marketing purposes. They compiled profiles on their users and made these available to affiliated companies who then provided targeted advertisements for their own products and services through direct mail and telemarketing. They relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to do so.

At the time of the investigation,which followed a complaint from a data subject, there were 15 such affiliated companies, with the personal data being collected from users and website visitors being stored in two group-wide data bases from which it was then shared with the affiliate companies. One of these databases was a “behavioral data base”.

The personal data recorded in this database, by means of a cookie identifier, included the URL that the user visited, as well as its category and content type, information on the user’s device and their IP address, behavioral data in terms of time spent and the time the page was viewed and also whether the user logged into the website. In some instances, this data could be linked with the user’s data in the customer data base, resulting in a full behavior profile including the user’s age, gender, their car ownership and some variable based on the users’ residential area, such as their life phase, housing type and purchasing power.

During the course of the investigation, the controller argued that they are not joint controllers in respect of the personal data, and that after the affiliated companies access the data provided in the databases, that they alone are responsible for the legality of that processing.

The controller further argued that while the personal data in the customer database was personal data, the data in the behavioral database was comprised of anonymous data and as such was not personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR.

The controller also submitted that this interest outweighed the interest of their customers in the protection of their personal data. The controller claimed that such was the case as the customers could object to the profiling, that the customers already have a direct relationship with one (or more) of the affiliates, either from having purchased from their websites or having visited their website, that the processing was unlikely to adversely affect the data subject’s interests as their interaction with the affiliates was voluntary and, finally, that the processing is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the data subjects.","1.

"A company offering so-called ""small loans"" - eCommerce 2020 ApS (eCommerce) – sent information about non-payments of loans for registration at a credit scoring company - Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

The Icelandic DPA issued a decision (case no. 2020061901 – see summary on GDPRHub) against Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. after the consumers' association of Iceland filed a complaint against it. Following the investigation in that case, it was revealed that the loan terms of eCommerce did not include any provision stating that non-payment (for 40 days) leads to registration of non-payment at Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

"In 2019,  the Special Privacy Unit of the Guardia di Finanza opened a preliminary investigation on the Benetton Group, the controller, regarding the processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes.

In this preliminary procedure, the following issues were identified: a) the cookie banner used on the familycard.benetton.com website did not allow users to deselect some types of cookies and did not mention profiling cookies although they were used; b) the cookie banner on the blackcard.sisley.com site presented a ""click here"" hypertext link leading to a blank page that did not provide the relevant information; c) contrary to what was informed during the registration procedure, personal data collected for the loyalty programs were being stored since 2015, even for customers who did not give their consent to profiling; d) promotional e-mails were sent to customers even after they had opted out of the loyalty program or  withdrawn their consent for marketing communications.

In its defense, the controller stated that the information on the familycard.benetton.com site mentioned cookies for direct marketing, marketing and retargeting cookies of third parties, which, in its view, fell under the definition of profiling cookies. It also claimed that the retention period was in line with the loyalty program, which provided for up to 10 years of retention in order to assess the scores and prizes awarded to members. Moreover, it alleged that its management systems were differentiated between those dedicated to loyalty cards, to digital customers, and its newsletters. According to the controller, each system was managed separately and based on different documentation, so that the customer can decide what type of communication they want to receive. Finally, it claimed to have implemented organizational and technical measures to overcome possible critical profiles identified during the investigations.

The procedure was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic and resumed only in 2021, when the Italian DPA carried out an on-site inspection to verify the measures that the controller claimed to have implemented. In this inspection, the DPA found that: a) the personal data of customers were being stored for indefinite time without a justification; b) personal data of customers were being transferred to third parties for marketing and profiling purposes without consent; c) vulnerabilities regarding the stores' platform such access to the loyalty program system without the need for a login.

With regard to these findings, the controller stated that the data collected through the website was retained for the purpose of allowing customers to use their services uninterruptedly over time.

In this email, Airbnb asked for a copy of the data subjects’ identification documents.

On 18 July 2018, the data subject responded, refusing to provide a copy of his ID. Airbnb responded to this email on 19 July 2018, asking to verify the data subject’s identity via telephone call instead, the data subject agreed. On 31 July 2018, Airbnb conducted a telephone call with the data subject to authenticate his requests.

On 30 August 2018, Airbnb responded to the data subject’s access request by email and provided a copy of the data but did not acknowledge the erasure request. The data subject’s access request was made in German, and all other communications with Airbnb were also made in German. However, the email attaching his personal data was in English and contained unsorted table columns with incomprehensible column headings.

On 11 September 2018, the data subject responded to Airbnb’s previous communication, claiming that their response to his access request was incomplete. On 13 September 2018, Airbnb acknowledged receipt of the data subject’s email but made no further communications with the data subject.

The original complaint which was submitted on 6 July 2018 was then transferred to the Berlin DPA on 1 January 2019, as Airbnb’s German offices were based in Berlin. On 7 February 2020, the Berlin DPA transferred the complaint to the Irish DPA (DPC) in its capacity as the lead supervisory authority, as Airbnb’s main establishment is in Ireland (Articles 56 and 60 GDPR). However, all communications between the DPC and the data subject were still made through the Berlin DPA. On 13 May 2020, the DPC notified Airbnb of the complaint.

On 27 May Airbnb responded to the DPC, noting that the 2015-pre GDPR erasure requests had not been upheld because their systems registered them as spam-mail. Moreover, in relation to the access and erasure requests made by the data subject on 6 July 2018, Airbnb stated that the file was provided on 28 August following the confirmation of the data subject’s identity and that the data subject’s erasure request was “commenced on 29 August 2018.” In addition, as to Airbnb’s incomplete access request response, Airbnb noted that it had referred the data subject to sections 2,3,4 and 7 of its Privacy Policy, which Airbnb argued addressed the questions on “which data? From where? On what legal basis? Transferred to whom?”

The data subject was dissatisfied by Airbnb’s response of 27 May 2020 and communicated this to the Berlin DPA on 3 August 2020, which was then passed on to the DPC on 14 October 2020. In this, the data subject did not accept that Airbnb had erased his data and questioned why Airbnb erased his data immediately after his access request before he could review their response to it.

The DPC notified Airbnb of the data subject’s complaint from 3 August 2020 and requested a further response from Airbnb. On 9 December 2020, Airbnb responded mainly reiterating its submissions made on 27 May 2020. The DPC communicated this response from Airbnb to the data subject via the Berlin DPA on 24 March 2021. On 13 July 2021, the data subject reiterated his dissatisfaction with Airbnb’s response of 9 December 2020.

On 22 December 2022, acting in its capacity as the lead supervisory authority the DPC commenced an inquiry into the matter on the following issues:

* Issue 1: Whether Airbnb’s provision of the personal data and information concerning the processing of that personal data in response to the Complainant’s [data subject’s] access request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act [the Data Protection Act 2018]. 
* Issue 2: Whether Airbnb’s handling of the Complainant’s access request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act insofar as the information provided to the Complainant was in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. 
* Issue 3: Whether Airbnb’s handling of the Complainant’s erasure request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act.
* Issue 4(a): Whether Airbnb’s obligation to provide information on action taken in response to the access and erasure requests without undue delay pursuant to Article 12(3) GDPR was suspended until after the verification of the Complainant’s identity by phone call on 31 July 2018. 
* Issue 4(b): Whether Airbnb had a lawful basis for requesting a copy of the Complainant’s ID, and upon the Complainant’s refusal to provide same, whether Airbnb had a lawful basis to thereafter request a telephone call in order to verify the Complainant’s identity in circumstances where he had submitted a request for access and erasure pursuant to Articles 15 and 17 GDPR.

"On the 30th of November 2020, an external phone call notified the controller about a data breach. This was initially not recognised as a security flaw, and therefore was not immediately reported further within the controller organisation.

The controller,the insurance company Moderna Försäkringar (since April 2022 Trygg-Hansa A/S), notified Swedish DPA in December 2020, that a data breach had occurred. As a result, unauthorised access to the personal data of 650,000 customers, including special categories listed in Article 9(1) GDPR, was made possible.

In March 2021, the Swedish DPA initiated an investigation to uncover whether the controller had implemented appropriate safeguards and mitigated risks to the data subject resulting from the data processing, in line with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR.

The data breach notification pertained to16 different document types, that the Swedish DPA subsequently reviewed. The documents contained multiple categories of personal data: names, contact information, health accounts, ID numbers, economic data, etc. The controller had not conducted a data protection impact assessment prior to the processing in question, which would have identified the high risk associated with it.

The investigation revealed that data breach occurred in 4 steps:

1) An existing or potential customer called customer service enquiring about an insurance offer. The customer service representative sent an SMS or email to the customer after the phone call ended.

2) This SMS or email contained a URL to an insurance offer on Trygg-Hansa’s website.

3) Trygg-Hansa's website contained additional links to documents with insurance information.

4) These documents contained URLs that were (able to be changed) on the website browser allowing access to other customers' documents.

Trygg-Hansa's backend database was therefore, accessible without requiring authentication, and anyone could browse private documents from other individuals by modifying in the URL the client ID number.","1.

The DPA then contacted the data subjects concerned, who agreed to close the case if the DPA conducted its own initiative investigation since numerous cases brought against one controller could be considered an indication of an established behaviour of the controller.

"In December 2019, the DSB received an anonymous submission claiming that a controller had installed GPS-trackers on its company vehicles, monitoring not only business trips but also private rides of the its employees. Further, the complaint stated that the controller would create an employee profile based on such data.

Accordingly, the DSB started an ex officio investigation under Article 57(1)(h) GDPR and obtained evidence about the following facts: the controller leased 15 company vehicles from a leasing provider and put them at its employees’ disposal for both business and private trips. In 2020, the controller asked a third party company to install a GPS-tracking device on every vehicle. Initially, this was used to determine the current location of the vehicle when asked; from July 2021 onwards, the GPS-system has also been used as a tool for keeping record of working hours, business trips and for calculating travel expenses. The device placed on the vehicles transmits data to a server and is activated by starting the car’s engine and it is deactivated as the engine stops. However, each car also includes a switch allowing the driver to deactivate the device manually. The transmitted data includes: covered distance in km, date and time, starting point, destination and location data of the vehicle (and the actual route covered). The controller has knowledge about some of this data (the address of, arrival and departure from the customers’ premises) thanks to the coordinators who organize business trips and assign them to the employees on a daily basis, hence without the need to access the data collected by the tracking devices. In order to access to the data generated by the tracking devices, one must log into a software app. The only employees who have these credentials are those responsible for payroll accounting and financial management and the coordinators.  Externally, the company that installed the devices, as a processor, also has access to such data.

The controller submitted that it is both under a legal obligation to process real-time location data of some of its employees in accordance with Article 6(1)(c) GDPR and it also has a legitimate interest to do so under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.","1.

"A Danish citizen lodged a complaint with the Danish DPA regarding the Danish Agency for Digital Government's (the controller) processing of his personal data in their Driving Licence app, which he had not registered for or used.

The app is a digital alternative to the physical driving licence and contains information about the licence holder's name, birth data, place of birth, nationality, licence number, passport number, passport photo, social security number, health, and data relating to criminal convictions and offences.

Following the complaint, on 7 September 2022, the DPA started an own-volition investigation of the matter. They found that the controller was processing the personal data of approximately 3.96 million Danish citizens with a driving licence, yet only 1.7 million had registered for the app, while the remaining group had not joined the app.

The controller attributed the excessive processing to technical constraints of the driving licence database, built on an outdated mainframe system, which gave it access to all valid Danish driving licenses. They explained to have initially considered three possible solutions for the app but deemed only the one adopted realistically viable. The one adopted complied with certain operational and performance requirements while allowing for the digital driving licence, updated with the latest information, to be made accessible to citizens.

"A Danish citizen brought a complaint to the Danish DPA concerning a picture of themselves being published on the Instagram account of Aarhus University Hospital (AUH). Based on this, on 19 December 2022, the DPA initiated an investigation against the Central Denmark Region (the controller).

During the investigation, the DPA found that the Instagram account regularly published photos and videos of daily life at AUH. It showed pictures of patients, staff and relatives, and the account has been active since June 2015; it had more than 15,000 followers and more than 1,400 posts. A review of the account also revealed that there were posts with pictures and information about patients dating back to 2016. In some cases, these included information on health conditions.

The controller explained that the information on the account is published to inform the outside world about the hospital’s activities and daily life. It further clarified that posts containing information about citizens, including patients, were published on the basis of consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR. Consent was obtained in writing before the publication of the post, and granting it or not did not affect the health treatment offered to the patient. The controller also stated that its processing met the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, as well as the principle of data minimisation pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, since they did not process personal data not necessary for the hospital purposes. To limit this, they also ensured that information such as social security numbers and names were be displayed on monitors, medical records and patient wristbands appearing in the pictures. Lastly, the controller claimed to observe also the principle of storage limitation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR since data subjects could make erasure requests.","1.

"On 20 January 2022, the Danish DPA received an inquiry from a citizen about the Agency for Digital Government’s (the controller) use of JavaScript, a programming language, in connection with MitID, the Danish digital ID. In general, the inquiry stated that JavaScript is outdated and not safe and that devices can easily be hacked if JavaScript is enabled, as highlighted by leading security experts for many years.

The DPA decided to further investigate the issue and requested the controller to present statements regarding the processing in question. The controller explained that it conducted a risk assessment of MitID and identified relevant risks, including overall risks related to code quality, which JavaScript falls under. However, it stated it did not assess possible risks to the rights of the data subjects when using specifically JavaScript. Nonetheless, it clarified to have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a sufficient level of security to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Regarding this processing, the controller also clarified that many security requirements have been set to ensure that the system is secure and updated at all times. Finally, the controller noted that in 2013 it assessed the usage of JavaScript for NemID (the old eID, replaced by MitID) and found that a JavaScript solution would have always provided high security levels.","1.

"The Icelandic DPA initiated an ex officio investigation aimed at assessing the use of Google cloud solutions and Google Workspace for education in elementary schools in five municipalities in Iceland. This summary refers to the inquiry into the use of Google’s systems in primary schools of the city of R.
On 25 February 2022, the DPA sent a questionnaire to the city of R., and carried out its assessment based on the answers and following documents produced by the city of R:
A so-called “processing file”, containing all relevant information about the data being processed in Google’s student system. Among others, almost every service included students’ names and e-mail addresses and additional information about their parents or social security numbers that can be added by the students. 
Secondly, this included a data protection impact assessment, dated 13 June 2022. In the DPIA, the city of R stated that the goal of using Google’s systems in schools was that of supporting the academic progress of students, meet their needs, allowing them to participate in school activities remotely, making project collaboration possible and others. The DPIA also clarifies that processing that falls outside the scope of the core processing activities would be omitted as far as possible. Further, it specifies that Google processes service data in the operation and management of the cloud solution including payments, settings, technical details and direct communications. With respects to data retention and deletion of personal data, the DPIA states that most data is retained for the whole school year and that teachers are encouraged to delete data. With respect to the relationship with Google, the DPIA specifies that a processing agreement was in place and it contained instructions in compliance with Article 28(3) GDPR. It could thus be concluded from the DPIA that the City of R had taken adequate measures to mitigate the risks to rights and freedoms of primary school students. The DPIA was then updated in September 2022, addressing also risks related to the transfer of personal data to third countries.
Thirdly, the City of R attached the data processing agreement among the documents. The agreement between the city of R and Google stipulated that the city of R is the controller and Google the processor. In some instances, however, the city could also be the processor and Google the sub-processor, when ….
The agreement also states that the controller instructs the processor on the processing of personal data, but this is limited to certain cases. Further, it contains provisions on the security of processing, transfers of personal data and other obligations. 
Google’s terms specify the information that google is provided with by the controller and information that google collects itself, either information that is added by users or device, log and location information based on the use of its services. They also state that google processes users’ information collected when using its services only to provide those services and this is processed in accordance with Google’s privacy policy. 
Google’s privacy policy differentiates between customer data and service data: customer data relates to information that the City of Reykjavík or the users of Google’s student system transmit to Google through the system and it is covered by the processing agreement; whereas service data is data collected or generated by google during the provision and administration of its cloud services, which is processed in accordance with its privacy policy. 
Lastly, in its comments, the City of R submitted that the systems are used approximately by 8.500 students and it claimed that it has done everything it could in order to ensure compliance with the GDPR. 
After requests to provide further information and an exchange of comments, the DPA issued a report detailing the results of its assessment. After hearing explanations and viewpoints of the city of R on the DPA’s assessment, the DPA published its final decision.","1.

With respect to the relationship with Google, the DPIA specified that a processing agreement was in place and it contained instructions in compliance with Article 28(3) GDPR. The controller thus concluded from the DPIA that it had taken adequate measures to mitigate the risks to rights and freedoms of primary school students.

Thirdly, the City of Reykjavík attached the data processing agreement. The agreement between the City of Reykjavík and Google stipulated that the City of Reykjavík was the controller and Google the processor. The agreement also stated that the controller instructs the processor on the processing of personal data, but this is limited to certain cases. Further, it contained provisions on the security of processing, transfers of personal data and other obligations.

In addition, the controller attached Google's terms and Google's privacy policy concerning its cloud services. Google’s terms specify the information that google is provided with by the controller and information that google collects itself, either information that is added by users or device, log and location information based on the use of its services. The terms also state that google processes users’ information collected when using its services only to provide those services and this is processed in accordance with Google’s privacy policy. Google’s privacy policy differentiates between customer data and service data: customer data relates to information that the City of Reykjavík or the users of Google’s student system transmit to Google through the system and it is covered by the processing agreement; whereas service data is data collected or generated by Google during the provision and administration of its cloud services, which is processed in accordance with its privacy policy.

Lastly, in its comments, the controller submitted that the systems are used approximately by 8,500 students and it claimed that it has done everything it could in order to ensure compliance with the GDPR.

After requests to provide further information and an exchange of comments, the DPA issued a report detailing the results of its assessment. After hearing explanations and viewpoints of the controller on the DPA’s assessment, the DPA published its final decision.","1.

"The data subject is a former customer (tenant) of the controller (Gavanova de immobles, S.L.).

On 29 July 2020 the data subject signed the reservation document for the property, then on 4 September 2020 the lease agreement / contract was signed. After approximately two years the lease was terminated on 31 January 2022.

On 30 June 2022 the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) received a complaint from the data subject stating, that they didn’t feel that their data was protected by the controller. The data subject suspected that their personal data had been used to enter into a contract with a third party (a cleaning company) without their knowledge. When the data subject went on the real estate´s website, the Privacy Policy page was blank. The data subject also found out that the contract and lease resolution made between the two parties, contained data protection law which was not up to date with the current law.

Following the complaint lodged by the data subject, the Spanish DPA accessed the website of the controller on 27 July 2022 and confirmed that the Privacy Policy section was in fact blank. As a result, the DPA asked the controller to explain themselves. The reason for that step was, that the controller could proceed with the analysis and inform the DPA within one month of actions carried out to adapt to the requirements set out in the data protection regulations. This was carried out in accordance with Spanish Public Administration Law (Common Administrative Procedure for Public Administrations) by electronic means. However, the controller did not take up the required steps and it was understood to have rejected them. Nevertheless, a copy was sent via post which was notified on 31 August 2022. In this notification, the controller was reminded to interact electronically and that from now on they would be notified exclusively by electronic means. The controller did not reply.

On 20 September 2022 the complaint was admitted for processing.

Shortly after, the Spanish DPA accessed the website again to check if any changes have been made. The DPA proved that the Private Policy page was last updated on 29 September 2022.

As a result, the director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the controller for the infringement of Article 13 GDPR as defined in Article 83(5)(b) GDPR. This initiation agreement was notified and delivered to the controller on 16 December 2022.

The controller responded with a written statement in due time and form on the 21 December 2022. The controller mentioned that the data subject had authorised them to process their data including the possible transfer to other companies (in this case a cleaning company). The data subject had agreed with the landlady that the cleaning of the flat would be deducted from their deposit.

Therefore, the controller argued that the complainant authorised them to process their data. Moreover, there was no significant proof of any exchange of data between the controller and the cleaning company. In addition, the controller information given to the complainant was only out of date and since then has been updated the Privacy Policy and Legal Notice have been modified. -The controller even invoked the mitigating factor that they complied with the DPA and with the procedure. They contacted a consultancy firm to advise them on compliance with the rules.  They noted that no benefits have been claimed from the commission of the offence and no rights of minors have been harmed.

On the 31 January 2023 the DPA agreed to open a period of evidence. The complaint by the data subject and the controller´s allegations to the initiation agreement and the accompanying documentation were already incorporated. The controller was required to provide a copy of the new contract they make with tenants, landlords and third-party companies.

"In 2019, the Finnish DPA had asked a healthcare provider (the controller) to explain how its online appointment booking system worked.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that a user had to log in to the booking system with their name and personal identity code. The system had compared the information provided by the user against the information stored in the controller's patient information system. The user had been instructed to check the login information if it did not match the information in the patient information system.

The controller acknowledged that, under certain conditions, the online appointment booking service could have been used to determine the complete personal identity of a data subject code by using brute force technique. The controller considered that this could have been prevented by limiting the retries of incorrectly entered login information.

The controller also stated that it was able to investigate possible misuse by examining the log data collected from the service. The controller was aware that the personal identity code may often be known to people other than the data subject. However, the controller had assessed the overall risks to be low or moderate in terms of likelihood and severity.

In 2020, the controller had submitted a data breach notification to the DPA, according to which the controller's online appointment booking system had been targeted by phishing. The phishing had come to light as a result of a blackmail message received by the controller, which revealed that a third party had obtained personal identity codes through the system.

"The CNIL commenced an investigation into the data controller to verify compliance with the GDPR, including an online check of the website www.new.neosurf.com and an on-the-spot check of the data controller’s premises. The data controller was an electronic money distributor that facilitates online payments. The rapporteur undertaking these investigations found that when creating a user account on the www.neosurf.com website, the surname, first name, date of birth, postal address, email address, telephone number and, if applicable, bank details were collected, as well as personal documents, such as proof of identity and residence. While the data controller specified a retention period of ten years of this data from the last transaction carried out on the account, in fact, no purge had been carried out in the databases since the beginning of its activity in 2005. An estimated 70,049 accounts had been inactive for more than ten years, but not deleted or anonymised. Additionally, 51,735 accounts were kept for no purpose, insofar as they were ""unconfirmed"", i.e. the email address had not been confirmed when the account was created.

Furthermore, the information provided by the company on the website www.neosurf.com and on its mobile application via the privacy policy was incomplete, not up-to-date and only in English.

The data controller also allowed users to create account passwords comprised of six-characters or more, composed of three categories of characters (uppercase, lowercase and numbers) and that no access restrictions in the event of authentication failure were implemented. 49,214 passwords were entered in clear text in the company's database and associated with their email address and identifier.

Additionally, thirteen cookies were deposited before any action, including consent, could be taken by the user upon arrival on the home page of the website www.neosurf.com. The Google reCaptcha module, to block robots on the registration and connection page to the neosurf website and mobile application, was also used without asking for user consent.

The data controller argued that the proposed administrative fine was disproportionate to the alleged breaches and its conduct since it had implemented several corrective measures, in particular, the effective application of its policy on the retention of user account data, the implementation of a password policy with an adequate level of security, the use of a state-of-the-art password hashing algorithm and the collection of consent to the deposit of cookies and tracers when required.","1.

"The Finnish DPA had asked the controller (OP-Henkivakuutus Oy, a life insurance company) to explain on which legal basis and for what purpose it processed data subjects' health data requested from the health care. The controller was also asked to explain how it processed personal data before the execution of an insurance contract.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the processing was based on Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, according to which insurance institutions may, despite the general prohibition in Article 9(1) GDPR, process the health data of the insured party and the claimant, which is necessary to determine the liability of the insurance institution. The controller considered that it had the right to process health data at all stages of the life insurance customer relationship: when applying for insurance, during the insurance period and after an insured event has occurred.

The controller also stated that it requested all data subjects applying for life insurance for their consent to that the controller may, if necessary, request health data from health care units in order to process the insurance application and possible compensation case, and to ensure the accuracy of the health data. The controller considered it necessary that the consent given by data subjects was valid for the entire duration of the insurance contract.

The controller claimed that a situation where the data subject withdraws their consent or does not give it in the first place, but the controller must still issue life insurance and keep it valid, is impossible. In the controller's view, the data subject could have terminated the insurance at any time if they did not want the controller to receive their health data from the health care.","1.

"Following a series of reports and complaints against ICS, a subsidiary of ABN AMRO, as a controller, the Dutch DPA (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, AP) decided to start an ex officio investigation into the processing operations carried out by the controller. The AP mainly received complaints concerning the controller's process of re-identifying its customers online by means of a new identification and verification tool, ID&V. The AP found that the controller never conducted a DPIA in 2018, prior to the introduction of its identification system, and asked the controller to provide its submissions on this.

The controller claimed in this respect that it did not need to carry out a DPIA, since the same identification system was used by ABN AMRO before, and ABN AMRO had previously carried out a risk assessment of its own authentication app. Moreover, the controller argued that when ID&V was introduced, there were no risks of potential misuse of personal data, and strict security measures were in place. Also, the controller argued that the only criterion that suggested the need to carry out a DPIA, according to Article 35 GDPR, was the fact that the processing was large-scale, but no other criteria were given that would make its processing activities ""high risk"". Lastly, the controller claimed that it does not process any special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR.","1.

"In November 2019, the French DPA (""CNIL"") carried out inspections on the premises of Amazon France Logistique (“controller”) to apprehend the processing of employee's personal data via scanners and video surveillance.

The CNIL discovered that when an employee was assigned to a direct task, they were equipped with a scanner, enabling them to identify themselves, receive instructions, scan labels of the items they were processing etc. This allowed the controller to continuously collect data relating to the activity of employees assigned to direct tasks making it possible to measure the employee’s activity, in particular by counting the number of units they process over a given period.

Inactivity indicators were reported in real time for each employee. One of the indicators named Stow Gun Machine allowed the controller to monitor each gesture performed by the employee in each direct task assigned to them, by associating with it an error indicator each time their speed was less than 1,25 seconds. These indicators were stored for 31 days and could be consulted both via raw data and in the form of statistics. Weekly performance reports were drawn up for each employee on the basis of the indicators collected, and contained weekly, daily and hourly statistics on compliance with quality procedures and productivity.

"AULA is Denmark's school communication platform. AULA therefore, processes personal data, including confidential and sensitive personal data, about vulnerable data subjects, including children. The users of the system are often persons who do not work primarily with data protection (including teachers, staff as well as pupils and parents) and so high security measures under Article 32 GDPR and Article 25 GDPR are required.

The Danish DPA observed a number of personal data breaches in connection with the processing of personal data in AULA within Danish municipalities. A large proportion of the notifications of personal data breaches in AULA concern personal data being sent to one or more incorrect recipients in AULA. For example, where a message or secure file about a child has been sent to another child's parents, or where a message has been sent by mistake to a group of recipients instead of a specific recipient.

The DPA therefore, decided to conducted inspections into the processing of data in the AULA IT system across six municipalities. The investigations focused on the security of technical and organisational measures.

The DPA decided to inspect these municipalities collectively. Since all muncipalites used the same IT systems the same general data protection law issues would arise. The investigation included Esbjerg Municipality, Frederikshavn Municipality, Hillerød Municipality, Copenhagen Municipality, Lolland Municipality and Randers Municipality, which were selected with the aim of gaining a broad and representative insight into the municipalities' considerations in relation to the security of processing when using AULA.

"Between March 2022 and October 2022, the French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out on-site inspections of TAGADAMEDIA (“controller”), as well as online inspections of their website. The CNIL discovered that the controller collected data (first name, surname, date of birth, postal address, e-mail address, phone number) from prospects through forms when offering them to participate in competitions or product testing on its website.

The controller used two forms to do so: before 2017, the controller used a single-button form – below the fields allowing data subjects to enter their details, there was a single “I VALIDATE” button with a green background and an arrow. Above the button, a text in a much smaller font stated that by clicking on the button, the user accepted that the data collected would be used to send offers from the controller’s partners and hyperlinks provided access to the data protection policy. The end of the text indicated that if the data subject wished to continue without receiving offers from the company’s partners, they could click on a link in the text (“I click here”), allowing the data subject to accept, or refuse that their personal data be sent to the controller’s partners.

The second form implemented from 2017 until the notification of the sanction report in 2023 was a two-button form with an “I VALIDATE” button written in white on a red background and an “I REFUSE” button written in black on a grey background, in a font smaller than the first button. Above these buttons, a text written in a font much smaller than that used for the buttons specified that by clicking on the ""I VALIDATE"" button, the user accepted that the data collected would be used to send offers from the company's partners.

"The Italian DPA, received the news about a new AI-driven surveillance system implemented by the municipality of Trento, the controller, with the support of FBK, a research foundation. In the context of this social experiment, the controller allowed the deployment of three projects, “Marvel” and “Protector”, concluded by now, and “Precrisis” still to be activated, using AI systems that were developed by the foundation in order to collect data from public areas in the municipality by means of videocameras and microphones that could serve the aim of preventing potential situations of danger to the public.

Upon learning about these facts, the DPA initiated an investigation into the processing operations related to the above mentioned projects by the controller and asked it to provide further information.

Among other things, the controller specified that the projects were EU-funded and provided details about the technical functioning of each of them. In particular, “Marvel” is aimed at developing an automated system analysing real-time audiovisual scenes in order to detect urban security issues. The foundation has access to the recordings of the public cameras in the municipality, which are instantly anonymized and analysed in the workstations of the foundation. The “Protector” project instead is aimed at improving security around places of worship, especially against the risk of hate crimes and terror attacks. The platform acquires video data from cameras present in the areas around places of worship and textual data derived from social media hate comments which are then elaborated by an AI system in order to detect possible relevant risks. Here too, the foundation has real-time access to the recordings which are instantly anonymized. Lastly, as regards the “Precrisis” project, the controller submitted that this has not been implemented yet but will be activated soon, upon adopting the necessary measures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.

Further, the controller submitted, with regard to all three projects, that the legal basis for such processing is Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and the controller referred to an Italian law that grants competence to municipalities to adopt video-surveillance systems to improve urban security. Further, the controller claimed that since the projects are still in their development stage, the provisions of the GDPR would only start applying when these are activated. Moreover, the controller added that such research projects would also be carried out in line with the provision in Article 89 GDPR. Last, the controller submitted that it nominated the foundation as a processor under Article 28 GDPR for the future processing of personal data that will take place once the projects are activated.

The DPA responded to these and further submissions by the controller stating that it would start proceedings aimed at the adoption of corrective measures against the controller for unlawful processing activities.","1.

"Following several compaints, the DPA launched an ""ex officio"" investigation. The controller (Client 1, Pitagorasz Oktatási Stúdió Kft) organises preparation courses for entry exams to secondary schools. It sent letters to students of different age (who are probably interested in applying for an entry exam), addressed to the students but mentioning that they are destined (also) to their caretakers. The addresses were received from the official government register, quoting as purpose market research. There is a law enabling this, but since 2019, this is not possible for direct marketing in respect of private individuals. The letters were sent after the registration to the courses was closed. Parents were informed about the source of the data at the bottom of the letters, and that the use of the data was terminated when the letter was forwarded. The information on the letter and in the legal basis could give the impression that this was an official communication and based on a legal obligation. The letter itself did not contain a market research questionnaire and could not be returned by mail. It hinted to an on line questionnaire which could be filled in. The privacy statement was not provided, it was only mentioned that it is available on the homepage of the controller (not a specific link to the statement itself). The information on the privacy statement mixed the processing of addresses used for sending the letters, the processing of registrations and of responses to the on line questionnaire. Different pieces of information (registration form, privacy statement etc.) contained differing information as to the legal basis of processing. The information given for consent was incomplete. The DPA acquired information from the provider of a mailing software and database used. It was established that this provider did not have access to the personal data, was neither controller, nor processor. The DPA investigated the database and found data of different groups of data subjects in it, including those who filled in the on line questionnaire, registrants and even lecturers. Not all data were collected on line, some were entered into the database manually. The fact of consent was not indicated at all data subjects whose data were processed based on consent. An assessment of interest was not conducted for the processing based on legitimate interest. Data of data subjects who meanwhile withdrew consent (were inactive) were not removed in time and were found in the database. Controller also enabled registrations to a newsletter and to send information about course organisation but did not separate the consent to these two different purposes.","1.

"In 2023, as part of a wider initiative led by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA) like the majority of the members of the EDPB, jointly undertook the examination of the topic ""The definition and position of the data protection officer"". To facilitate this examination, the EDPB developed a unified questionnaire, which the Hellenic DPA adopted. Later on May 3, 2023, the Hellenic DPA exercising its investigative powers sent the questionnaire to 31 public bodies in Greece, including the Municipality of Athens (hereinafter ""Controller""), with a deadline for submission via the EUsurvey link until May 19, 2023.

The DPO of the Controller (hereinafter “DPO"") failed to respond to the questionnaire within the set deadline. The Hellenic DPA re-sent the questionnaire on May 26, 2023, with a new deadline of May 31, 2023. Once again, the DPO failed to respond in time. The DPO, after the deadline expired, attempted to complete the form without success as the above link had been deactivated by the Hellenic DPA. Upon DPO’s communication with Hellenic DPA, the link was reactivated, and the data controller was informed of a new deadline for submission until June 21, 2023. Once again, the DPO failed to submit the questionnaire in time.

The controller was then summoned by the Hellenic DPA to appear before the plenary on Tuesday, December 19, 2023. The DPO contacted the DPA by telephone and informed that he had inadvertently failed to respond due to technical issues and undertook to complete and submit it immediately. After which, the Hellenic DPA reactivated the submission link to the questionnaire, and the controller finally submitted the questionnaire on December 18, 2023. At the plenary meeting, which was held in person, the DPO stated once again that the reason for the delayed response was technical issues with the website where the questionnaire was held, which prevented submission even after several attempts.","1.

"On 23 September 2021, the French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out an inspection on Foriou’s premises (“controller”), in particular regarding the legal basis of the processing and the security measures taken. The controller was in the business of marketing and managing loyalty programs and cards. In order to promote its programs, until 2021, the controller carried out telephone canvassing campaigns using prospect files purchased with several data suppliers who collected the data via entry forms for online competitions. The personal data collected was the following: surname, first name, title, email address, date of birth and postal address.

During its investigations, the CNIL discovered that the data suppliers all had similar forms on their websites: there were fields which enabled the data subject to enter their contact details. Underneath these fields were a “Validate”, “I validate” or “I answer questions to apply” button. Above or below this button, a text specified that by clicking on it, the user declared that they read the data supplier’s data protection policy and accepts that the data collected would be used to send them offers from the company’s partners. Hyperlinks were provided to access the data protection policy as well as the list of partners concerned. However, the list did not mention the controller. At the end of the text it was specified that if the user wished to continue without receiving offers from the data supplier’s partners, they could click a link in the text (“click here”).

Therefore, data subjects could either click on the “Validate” button and accept that their data would be used to send them offers from the data supplier’s partners or on the “click here” link to continue without receiving these offers.

The controller also submitted 2 other forms in its observations. These forms contained “Validate my coordinates” and “Continue” buttons to validate participation in the game and transmit data to partners. The “click here” button remained unchanged and was still presented in the body of the text.

Regarding security measures, the CNIL found that the controller indicated that they would keep customer data for a period of 5 years from the date of the end of the contract in an active database with no intermediate archiving mechanism implemented.","1.

"On 22 October 2018, UniCredit S.p.A. (""controller"") notified the Italian DPA of a personal data breach that occurred on 21 October 2018. The breach occurred due to a cyberattack on the controller’s mobile banking portal for customers. Third parties tried to access customer accounts by attempting automatically-generated simple PINs.

The mobile banking portal had two vulnerabilities that facilitated the breach. First, the portal made customers’ personal data (first name, surname, tax code, and internal bank identification code) available in HTML responses to authentication attempts, including where attempts were unsuccessful. Second, the controller did not limit the use of simple PINs, making accounts vulnerable to cyberattacks aimed at identifying customer login information (brute force attacks).

Due to the HTML response vulnerability, every login attempt gave cyber attackers access to the names, tax codes, and internal bank identification codes of 777,765 present and former customers. In the case of 6,959 of those customers, the cyber attackers also successfully identified the portal PINs. The controller subsequently blocked the identified PINs. The breach did not include the data subjects’ banking data.

The controller did not consider the breach high-risk pursuant to Article 34 GDPR. It posted a general notice on its website and gave direct notice only to the 6,959 data subjects whose passwords were identified. The DPA disagreed, finding the breach likely to present a high risk to data subject rights after a preliminary investigation. On 13 December 2018, it enjoined the controller to communicate the personal data breach to all data subjects. The controller subsequently prepared differentiated notices, which the DPA found complied with Article 34(2) GDPR.

In a defense brief, the controller argued that it took preventive measures and mitigating controls which exceeded market standards at the time of the breach. Additionally, the controller argued that the breach occurred as a result of its data processor’s negligence. The processor was charged with carrying out vulnerability tests on the controller’s mobile webpage and application. Though it became aware of the mobile portal’s vulnerabilities on 19 October 2018 and identified them as high-level, the processor did not report these to the controller until 22 October 2018.","1.

"The Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs ('Minister') informed the DPA that the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland ('Consulate') sent, at the request of the District Court of Kraków ('Court'), correspondence through a postal operator to an addressee.

The addressee informed the Consulate that a delivered parcel was damaged, additionally wrapped and was incomplete. The infringement covered a various categories of personal data, namely first and last names, ID numbers, addresses of residence, dates of birth, bank account numbers, photographs. Personal data of two children were also breached.

The DPA identified the court as a controller of the data affected by the breach. It invited the Court to indicate whether a risk analysis had been done to assess whether a data protection breach required notifying the DPA and the affected individuals under Articles 33 and 34 GDPR. In its defence, the court referred to Article 175dd of the Law on the Common Court System, stating that the District Court of Kraków, under the President of the Court of Appeal in Krakow, is responsible for overseeing data processing in court proceedings and legal protection tasks.

As a response, the DPA clarified that it was the competent authority to investigate the infringement in question.

However, the Court reiterated its stance, referencing various articles of the Law on the System of Common Courts and a decision by the CJEU from March 24, 2022 (Case C-245/20). The Court emphasized that the protection of judicial independence is paramount, stating that judicial functions should be exercised independently without external interference or pressure. They asserted that the administration of justice encompasses all operations related to judicial activities, including informing parties about court proceedings.  Additionally, the Court referenced a decision by the DPA (no. ZSOŚS.440.109.2018) regarding the authority's reluctance to interfere with documents collected in court proceedings.

"The Medtronic Diabetes is a medical technology firm focused on innovation of diabetes solutions such as developing the MiniMed Mobile app which displays insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring data. The app offers a direct connection with patient's healthcare provider through a 'CareLink' Personal software.

The team member of the firm emailed users of the MiniMed Mobile app in different countries within and outside the EU. The purpose was to notify them about a server maintenance update and the steps needed to regain access to the 'CareLink' Personal software as part of this update.

The member of the team included the recipients’ e-mail addresses in the ‘To’ field instead of the ‘Bcc’ field which stands for ‘Blind Carbon Copy’. As a result, around 5,000 email addresses of MiniMed Mobile app users worldwide were exposed, including 732 in Italy.

The email notification didn't contain personal data, but recipients' email addresses were visible. Medtronic swiftly notified the breach to the Italian DPA, attempting to recall all emails and instructing affected users to delete them. After the incident, the controller re-trained staff on email notification procedures and started implementing an automated tool to prevent such incidents in the future.

These email addresses were in some cases made up of a combination of first name and surname of the data subject, which made it possible to identify the person in question, thus indirectly disclosing data relating to their health within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR.

"The Finnish DPA was notified that the controller (Verkkokauppa.com Oyj, an IT retailer) required customers to create a customer account in order to make online purchases. The DPA then asked the controller to explain why it required the creation of a customer account and for what purposes and for how long it stored the personal data of its customers.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the processing of customers' personal data was necessary for the provision of services and for the performance of a customer contract. The controller argued that it was able to reliably identify the data subject, demonstrate its accountability and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights through the customer account.

The controller explained that it sells long-life devices that may have very long warranty and defect liability periods. Therefore, it was in the customers' interest to have access to information and receipts regarding their online purchases through the customer account throughout the customer relationship.

The controller emphasised that if it allowed its customers to make online purchases without a customer account, it would have to process and store the personal data required for the placing and delivery of the order on an order-by-order basis, which would not be appropriate from a data security perspective and would not be in line with the principle of data minimisation.

The controller also stated that the contractual relationship was for an indefinite period, the duration of which was determined by the customer. Thus, the controller stored personal data until the customer account was deleted at the request of the data subject.

"The National Council of Notaries (""the Council"") requested the DPA to investigate regarding the proper classification of the relationships between banks and notaries when, in the process of loan stipulation, certain lending banks utilize the services of a third-party company named ""Euro Servizi per i Notai S.r.l."" (""ESpN"") for managing document exchange with notaries through a platform known as PIGNA.

PIGNA is a service provided exclusively to banks by ESpN which is a computing service provider. It enabled banks and notaries, who handle tasks related to loan contracts and associated guarantees, to share required documents. This sharing occurred both before and after the contract was signed, except for a copy of the contract in enforceable form. Essentially, PIGNA facilitated the efficient exchange of necessary paperwork between these parties involved in the loan process.

Several concerns arose from the situation described. Firstly, the Council recommended an investigation with regards to the roles and responsibilities in the processing of personal data within the PIGNA platform. This includes notaries, banks, and ESpN. The concern revolved around the processing of personal data of borrowers, related third parties (like property sellers), and data concerning the notaries themselves.

Secondly, the relationship between PIGNA and individual notaries was unclear since notaries accessed the platform with authentication credentials provided by ESpN.

Thirdly, there were issues with the level of information provided to notaries and the sequence of notifications sent by PIGNA. It was highlighted that notaries receive a range of notifications via both the portal and email. In some instances, these notifications arrive unexpectedly, directly from the lending bank selected by the borrower. For instance, they may receive notice granting them authority to issue a mortgage loan, which is not necessarily communicated by the borrower's chosen lending bank.

Specifically, certain communications originating from platform accounts aim to offer notaries period report of borrower's personal data. These communications are accompanied by a table or Excel sheet detailing various deeds under scrutiny or completed, all linked to the same notary, concerning different banks. They include an internal reference code within the portal and identify the relevant party (the borrower).

"The Worldcoin Foundation (the controller) used a phone application and in-person sites to engage in large-scale processing of biometric data, particularly irises, eyes and faces. The data was subsequently processed for various purposes including the creation of a digital identity profile (World ID).

On 10 August 2023, the Portuguese DPA (CNPD) initiated an investigation. The CNPD found that the controller had collected the biometric data of over 300,000 data subjects within Portugal. It noted in particular that the controller (1) collected biometric data of minors, (2) made it impossible to exercise the right to erasure of the collected data, (3) made it impossible to revoke consent, and (4) provided deficient information to data subjects.

The controller collected data initially through a phone application through which data subjects could create a World ID in order to use Worldcoin cryptocurrency. In order to ‘verify’ the World ID, data subjects were encouraged to visit the controller’s in-person stores so that a device called an ‘Orb’ could capture high-resolution images of their irises, eyes, and faces. The controller alleged that this ‘verification process’ was necessary to establish ‘proof of personhood’ and prevent duplication of World IDs. Orb operators were taught to encourage data subjects to consent to the storage and use of the biometric data. The controller offered tokens to encourage data subjects to provide their biometric data via the Orb, and offered financial rewards for them to invite others to have their biometric data collected.

In February and March 2024, the CNPD received reports from data subjects concerning mass collection of minors’ biometric information, the impossibility of exercising rights to erasure, and inadequate disclosure concerning risks of processing at the time of collection. The CNPD observed that there were no measures in place to verify data subjects’ ages. It noted that the controller’s consent forms expressly mentioned the impossibility of erasure and of revoking consent.

"The controller, a housing association, installed 38 (active) video cameras and three dummy cameras at a residential complex after an increased number of break-ins in the basement. The cameras monitored the general areas, including entrance areas and bicycle/trash rooms. The apartment entrance doors and residents’ personal spaces were excluded from the cameras’ scope and/or rendered unrecognisable. The data subjects, the residents, were informed about this in a newsletter and on the notice board at the complex.

On 03 November 2022, the Austrian DPA (‘Datenschutzbehörde’) was anonymously informed about the video surveillance system. The DPA then conducted a data protection review in accordance with Article 57(1)(h) GDPR.

The controller argued that the video surveillance system was in the interest of protecting property against theft, damage, and other disruptions (in accordance with Austrian national law, Section 28 WEG) and preserving evidence thereof.  The recordings were stored for a maximum of 72 hours.

The controller further argued that although the data subjects had not given their consent, it was not necessary because the legitimate interest of the controller overrode the interests of the data subjects. The proper fulfilment of a contract was also present because the data subjects reported break-ins at the complex. The controller had an obligation to take preventative measures in order to avoid damage.","1.

"At the end of 2021, the Hellenic DPA (HDPA) became aware of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum's (the controller) development and deployment of the ""Centaurus"" and ""Hyperion"" Programmes Closed Control Facility Centres for third country nationals on the Aegean islands (Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos). The HDPA also received requests for an investigation and opinion from the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament, as well as from civil society organisations, on the use of the systems in the asylum facilities.

The Centaurus project is reportedly an integrated digital system for the management of electronic and physical security around and within the facilities. The controller uses CCTV systems, artificial intelligence behavioral analytics (AI) algorithms and unmanned aerial vehicles to process images and personal data. The Hyperion programme is described as an integrated entry/exit control system, with the purpose of monitoring the entry and exit of the guests and certified members NGOs through the processing of personal data, in particular biometric data.

In response to the HDPA's request for explanations of the programmes and their data processing, the controller stated that the legal basis for the Centaurus project's video surveillance was the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority pursuant to Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. It argued that prior alternative protection measures, such as fencing of the property and patrols, were not as effective as video surveillance in dealing with illegal activities. With regard to the use of drone surveillance, the controller stated that they are only used in cases of emergency, such as fire or unrest. It claimed that the retention period of Centaurus system data is 15 days unless an incident is detected, in which case it is kept for up to 1-3 months  and that access to data subjects' data is restricted to authorised police users; if copies of footage need to be provided, persons are blurred so as to minimise data. Information was provided to data subjects with notifications and warning signs on CCTV systems. Further, anti-malware software, passwords, system maintenance and software-level security policies were cited as security measures.

In the case of the Hyperion programme, the controller seems to have argued that no biometric data was not used to identify data subjects, but nonetheless citing Article 6(1)(e) GDPR as the legal basis for such processing if it does occur. Where any processing of special categories of data (namely fingerprints and biometric data) occurred for identification purposes, the controller cited Article 9(2)(b), (c), (g) and (j) GDPR as its legal basis. In a later communication, it clarified that its primary legal basis in this regard was based on substantial public interest pursuant to Article 9(2)(g) GDPR. Regarding consent, data subjects entering the accommodation facility were prompted to fill out a personal data recording form which included a consent request. Finally, the controller noted that a partial Data Protection Impact Assessment was carried out for both the Centaurus and Hyperion programmes.

The controller also claimed that there was no processing of personal data by either programme that extracted special categories of data - as a result, it found that Article 9 GDPR did not apply.","1.

"An investigation was carried out by the Guardia di Finanza (financial police) in which fines were imposed on four companies and databases were confiscated as they related to illegally conducted telemarketing calls from 2015 to 2022. The calls aimed at promoting services of companies in the electricity and gas sector. One of these companies was Enel Energia ('the controller').

Further investigation of the databases revealed that Enel Energia acquired as many as 978 contracts from the four companies, even though the companies did directly not belong to Enel Energia's sales network. The agreements reached by these companies with potential customers were sent to the Enel Energia’s customer relationship management ('CRM') system, which actually concluded the contracts on behalf on Enel Energia.

An additional investigation was launched by the Italian DPA ('Garante'), which revealed that these marketing activities were carried out using illicitly acquired lists of customers which contained addresses, telephone numbers, municipality of customer residences, and the customer's relevant energy company. The four companies which were never officially designated by Enel nor any of its sales agencies as data processors, nor was Enel fully aware of these irregularities. However, the processing activities were performed on Enel's behalf and with economic profit for the latter.

The DPA investigated in particular the lack of security measures in the access to the CRM system. The Garante noted how it was extremely easy for external companies - even in lack of any direct contractual relationship with Enel - to obtain the credentials necessary to use the system and ""upload"" contracts in violation of the law.

As a response to the allegations made by the Garante, Enel Energia highlighted procedural irregularities. They contested the  proceedings, among other things, by claiming that the Garante infringed the principle of ne bis in idem as the objections overlapped with previous measures against Enel. In particular, the Tribunal of Rima by ruling No. 443/2021 had already annulled the Garante’s fine against Enel Energia.","1.

"HUBSIDE.STORE (“controller”) has stores in France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy. In France, the controller carried out canvassing campaigns by telephone and SMS from prospect files purchased from two main data brokers, in order to promote the products it sold. The French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out an inspection at the controller’s premises in order to verify compliance with the GDPR and French Data Protection Act.

During this inspection, the CNIL discovered that, regarding commercial prospecting by SMS, the controller carried out these operations using prospect files purchased from data suppliers. These data suppliers collected the data of the persons concerned via entry forms for online competitions, in order to enable their partners to use them in their commercial prospecting.

The CNIL indicated that the forms accessible on the websites of the data suppliers were similar: beneath the fields enabling the person to enter their contact details was a “VALIDATE”, “I VALIDATE” or “I ANSWER QUESTIONS TO APPLY” button. Above or below this button, a text specified that by clicking on the button, the data subject declares that they have read the controller’s privacy policy and accepts that the data collected will be used to send them offers from the company’s partners. Hyperlinks were provided to access the privacy policy and the list of partners concerned. At the end of the text, it specified that if the data subject wishes to continue without receiving offers from the controller’s partners, they can click on a link in the text (“click here”).

"On 7 December 2022, a data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD against Caixabank (the controller). The controller required new clients to sign a contract for provision of services, which included a clause stating that data subjects consent to their data being requested from the General Treasury of Social Security. For existing clients, the same clause was included in a declaration or modification contract. The provision cited Law 10/2010, a Spanish law on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, stating that it required the collection of such data. For both new and existing clients, the contract did not give an option to refuse consent – instead, consent was pre-established by the clause. 3,026,247 new clients signed the contract, and 3,401,052 existing clients signed the modification contract.

The data subject claimed that, after they expressed their disagreement, the controller stated that failure to sign the form with these clauses would result in the bank account being blocked.

On 30 January 2023, the AEPD informed the controller of the complaint. In its defense brief, the controller stated that it is required by Law 10/2010. In particular, it pointed to Article 11, which obliges financial institutions to guarantee that they are engaging with professional or business activities of the client.

"On 15 March 2022, I-DE Redes Eléctricas Inteligentes, S.A.U. (the controller) detected an attack on its GEA management portal (GEA portal), which is a web portal that manages service connections between the electric distribution network. At that point, the controller had yet to detect any effect on personal data.

The following day (16 March), a brute force attack was made against the same webpage, resulting in a general slowdown. The controller adopted security measures in order to repel the attack. The controller analysed the attack’s activity and concluded that it has extracted the personal data of 1.35 million clients. The breached data included names, surnames, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, national identification card numbers and client codes. On 18 March 2022, the controller notified the breach to the AEPD.

The controller is Iberdrola's energy distribution brand. Spanish law concerning the electricity sector requires that regulated activities (such as distribution of electricity) and unregulated activities (such as marketing) be unbundled. In accordance with such law, the controller stated that it could only access the personal data of users of its electric service. It thus claims that it does not have access to the data of data subjects managed by other distribution companies.

Despite this separation, the controller communicated the breach to other companies of the Iberdrola group on 28 March 2022, noting that it could have affected information referring to clients of these companies. The controller included internal codes corresponding to the affected clients so that the companies could verify if those clients’ data had been compromised. Two companies, Iberdrola Clientes, S.A. and Curenergía Comercializador de Ultimo Recurso SA, subsequently reported to the AEPD that personal data of 92,550 and 1,515,000 clients was affected, respectively. Due to the numerous companies affected, the AEPD initiated investigations into four entities.

The controller requested that its case be joined with the AEPD’s investigation of Iberdrola (EXP202305587).

"The Hellenic Data Protection Authority undertook an investigation following numerous complaints regarding unsolicited spam calls originating from companies acting as call centres (hereinafter “processor”) on behalf of ELPEDISON A.E.

In Greece, individuals have the option to register under Article 11 of Greek Law 3471/2006 (hereinafter ""register-list"") to opt out of unsolicited communications. During the investigation, complaints that did not meet validity criteria (e.g., complainants not registered on the register-list or failing to raise objections under [[Article 21 GDPR|Article 21 GDPR]]) were rejected by the HDPA. The remaining 40 potentially valid complaints, two of which were still under investigation, were categorised into four categories. Category A: six complaints where the controller acknowledged a violation might had occurred. Category B: three complaints where the controller disputed the occurrence of a violation. Category C: twenty-nine complaints where the controller claimed to had fulfilled its obligation but the processor failed. Therefore, in addition to the controller, the investigation was extended to include five processors. These processors included BEFON (3 complaints), Call Experts (11 complaints), Televise (1 complaint), Zitatel (8 complaints), and Plegmanet (7 complaints). Category D: two complaints that were still under investigation at the time.

The controller had failed in many cases to provide a correct, up-to-date register-list on time, pointing out the complex process that involves receiving the register-list from various providers, which it then needs to combine and send to the processors. The processor pointed out that delays in the register-list update were due to the 11 million phone numbers that required reformatting before they could be imported and the long time required to upload them into the relevant systems.

"On 2 November 2022, a security breach occurred on Shanghai Moonton Technology Co. Ltd.’s (the controller) videogame forum. The controller is a Chinese videogame company headquartered in Shanghai that was acquired by Bytedance in March 2021.

The breach affected 442 Spanish data subjects and included usernames on the controller’s forum, user ID numbers, frequency of each data subject’s visit to the forum, the reported sex of data subjects, IP addresses, email addresses and the data subjects’ activities on the forum including publications and interactions. On the day of the breach, 2 November 2022, the personal data obtained in the breach was published on a third party website. The following day, 3 November 2022, a member of the controller’s security team identified the publication of the data on the third party website. From 4 November to 16 November 2022, the controller investigated the data breach. The controller identified the location of each data subject based on their IP address and notified the corresponding DPAs accordingly. It began notifying DPAs on 11 November 2022.

On 21 November 2022, the controller notified the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of thebreach.

In its investigation, the AEPD noted that the controller used moderators which were volunteers, not employees or contractors, in order to manage its forums. Moderators were hired using a two-week trial period and were required to abide by terms of service and a code of conduct. The controller gave moderators access to users’ personal data in order to monitor the forums and where necessary, revise or eliminate posts, block user access to the forum, respond to users or approve new users. This access included data which was available to all users on the forum including data subjects’ usernames, user IDs, number of visits to the forum, reported sex, and activities on the forum. In addition, moderators were given access to personal data which was not already publicly available to all forum users: data subjects’ email addresses, time and date of the most recent activity on the forum, and IP addresses.

The controller stated that it had security measures in place prior to the breach with regard to the affected data with the goal of avoiding such incidents. It was unaware of any prior security incidents and noted that it had not received any claim or request from data subjects in Spain in relation to the breach. With regard to the delay in notifying the AEPD of the breach, the controller argued that as it did not have a legal establishment in Spain, it needed to contract a legal assessor within Spain to prepare the due notification and documents.","1.

"On the night of 31 July 2021, a cyber-attack occurred in the healthcare system of the Lazio region, Italy. It had some serious repercussions causing local health authorities, hospitals and nursing homes ('the controllers') being unable to use regional information systems for hours and in some cases even for months. Essential services related to the emergency activities were not interrupted as they were separeted from other applications.

The ransomware attack originated in March 2021 on a computer of a regional employee working remotely for one of the entities. The employee installed a malicious software necessary to connect to the processor’s network. The software created a backdoor to the system stealing the employee’s access credentials.

LAZIOcrea S.p.a. was a company responsible for the management and security of the information systems of Lazio Region pursuant to Article 28 GDPR (‘processor’ or ‘company’). The attack targeted machines located in one of the rooms of the data center managed by the company. The company was therefore also acting as a controller for its own purposes, as the operating systems which were attacked also managed additional processing activities.

The company did not notify the data breach immediately but with considerable delay and in any case beyond 72 hours as required by Article 33 GDPR. The data breach was notified to the affected controllers about two weeks after the incident, lacking specific references to the attacked processing systems which would have been beneficial for each controller to delineate the extent of the breach and evaluate associated risks.

The notification of the data breach itself did not document necessary information about the attack such as, i.e. date and time of closure of the incident, date and time of resolution of the incident, person who detected the incident. Moreover, some of the information provided was inaccurate, i.e. description of the incident, the response actions carried out.

Due to this, the Italian DPA (‘Garante’) had to act ex officio following press reports regarding the facts in question and notifications presented by various data controllers involved. The investigation revealed that the company did not adopt several security measures.

Firstly, at the time of the incident, the company did not have staff dedicated to a 24-hour analysis of the alerts generated by Microsoft’s SIEM, the security monitoring system. Secondly, the company did not separate the networks for employee’s accounts and servers used for various processing operations carried out. Thirdly, although the filtering rules on the firewalls in the data center managed by the company were set up to target specific critical systems, they failed to stop the malware from spreading to around 180 systems. Fourthly, the attackers succeeded due to a vulnerable authentication procedure for remote system access, relying solely on username and password credentials and the company’s failure to update its operating system creating additional vulnerabilities.

It also emerged that the temporary unavailability of access to data processed through the mentioned healthcare facilities was, on the one hand, a direct consequence of the cyber-attack and, on the other hand, an indirect consequence of the subsequent actions by the company. In fact, the company decided to shut down all the server systems which disabled them from determining which ones were compromised. Additionally, given the absence of the system separation, it could not prevent further spread of the malware.

As part of its defence, the company represented that it performed annual internal audits based on the certification process of the Information Security Management System. The company also declared that prior to the accident, the system information security was implemented in compliance with the industry standards certification ISO/IEC 27001.","1.

"The Central Young Men’s Christian Association (the controller) offers a Positive Health Programme (Programme), which is an exercise scheme for people living with HIV. As part of the Programme, the Central YMCA collects special categories of data including referrals, dates of HIV diagnosis, medications taken, medical statistics, referring hospitals or clinicians and other medical history.

On 6 October 2022, a coordinator of the Programme sent an email to a mailing list of 270 recipients. The recipients were entered into the carbon copy (CC) function rather than the blind carbon copy (BCC) function, revealing the email addresses of all 270 recipients. The controller became aware of the breach the following day upon receiving complaints from affected data subjects. Upon realising the error, the coordinator attempted to unsend the email, but unintentionally sent a second email to all 270 recipients with the email addresses again entered in the CC function. Accounting for duplicates, 264 email addresses were disclosed in the breach, of which 115 had clear names and 51 had partial names that made them potentially identifiable. Thus, 166 data subjects were affected by the breach.

The controller reported the breach to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on 7 October 2022. On 10 October 2022, the controller notified the affected data subjects, took accountability of its error and informed data subjects of the steps it was taking.

At the time of the breach, the controller had a verbally communicated policy that the Programme staff should send event invitations using the BCC function. The controller had access to an email marketing tool which would permit for the sending of individual emails to each recipient, but it did not use this tool in sending emails relating to the Programme.

The controller waived its opportunity to respond to the ICO’s Notice of Intent and instead accepted the Notice and the ICO’s findings. It took remedial steps, conducting an audit of how external communications were being undertaken across the organisation and issuing new procedures to provide appropriate guidance on sending secure emails.

"The Italian Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) sent a notice to the DPA regarding possible existence of administrative violations related to Sigma s.r.l., a company which operates two Vodafone Italia S.p.A. sale points in northern Italy (‘Sigma or ‘controller’). The Financial Police carried out an investigation following a complaint by a customer of Vodafone who claimed that Sigma charged them on their credit card relating to an activation of a new contract for telephone services. The contract was concluded in the name of her deceased husband.

The investigation revealed that Sigma activated approximately 1,300 SIM cards, numerous telephone services under Vodafone brand and linked telephones to active users without their knowledge while they were made available for sale at the shop. Specifically, the company activated unsolicited services by inducing customers to sign, via a tablet, without clarifying the consequences of such consents. The company sold mobile phones without any request made by the customers that learned of the purchase by finding additional charges on their invoice. These services or devices were never delivered to the customers. Additionally, it emerged that Sigma used data of hundreds of users extracted from the Vodafone information systems.

Vodafone clarified that its relationship with Sigma is governed by a franchising contract according to which Sigma is a dealer acting as an autonomous controller of personal data related to SIM card and telephone service activations. Employees of Sigma were authorized to identify all customers and make a copy of their IDs in case of activation of a new product. Additionally, the data entry and activation of services was carried out by the employees through a computer connected to the Vodafone systems.

Consequently, circumventing the telephone operator’s controls and relevant processing provision amounted to a turnover of more than €80,000.","1.

"On 10 August 2022, a data subject notified 4Finance Spain Financial Services, S.A.U. (the controller) that they had received an unsolicited loan to their bank account with the controller. By 1 September 2022, the controller had received 10 more complaints of a similar nature from clients. The controller assessed the risk levels and severity of these breaches in August, September and November of the same year using an internal method based on European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) standards. Based on these assessments, the controller determined that it was not necessary to notify the violation to the AEPD or to affected parties.

Between 3 and 23 February 2023, the AEPD received various complaints from data subjects, who were clients of the controller, alleging similar unsolicited loans to their accounts. On 14 February 2023, the controller claimed to become aware of a data breach affecting personal data of its clients and employees. The breach ultimately affected 9636 data subjects and included names, birth dates, national identification numbers, foreigner identity numbers, passport or identification document numbers, payment data (such as banks and cards) and contact information.

The breach was a brute force attack that attempted different combinations of national identity numbers and emails with passwords. Once the attackers gained access to client accounts, they took out loans in the data subjects’ names, which the controller accepted and placed into client accounts. The hackers then contacted data subjects via WhatsApp, pretending to be the controller and requesting the refund of the amount to an account number controlled by the attackers. 139 of the affected data subjects were victims of this fraud.

The controller notified the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of the data breach on 17 February 2023. It expressed that it did not consider the breach to pose a high risk to the rights and liberties of affected data subjects and that it thus would not communicate the breach to them directly.

On 11 April 2023, the AEPD initiated an investigation against the controller and ordered the controller to communicate the breach to data subjects, which the controller did on the same day.

In response to the breach, the controller registered the breach in the register of incidents, filed a police report, circulated a communication to clients noting that it did not communicate with clients via Whatsapp, reset certain user passwords and amended its password policy to require more complexity and implemented two-factor authentication.","1.

"The Rome Chamber of Commerce (‘the Chamber’ or ‘controller’) notified the DPA that it was a victim of a cyber-attack. The attack resulted in the manipulation of their application’s database of users. The purpose was to load malicious files which then enabled remote access to the system. The controller learned about the attack through the publication of an anonymous tweet mentioning the Chamber and denouncing the attack on its website.

Subsequently, Innova Camara - the processor in charge of the management of the Chamber’s website - was informed of a link to a CSV file from where it was possible to download a list of 22,300 users. The personal data affected included names, surname, tax codes, e-mail address, landline or telephone numbers, and access and identification data.

The DPA’s investigation of the notified personal data breach revealed several vulnerabilities in the processor’s security measures.

Firstly, the concerned personal data was not found on the institutional website but in a database consisting of a backup copy of the appointment management system instead. The backup was created during a system upgrade. However, it was not delete after the period necessary to verify the functioning of the system. The controller acknowledged that this copy was supposed to be deleted earlier as the work on the system update was nearing completion. However, due to the health emergency at that time, the controller had to reschedule all priorities in order to render services to users.

Secondly, the passwords of users registered in the appointment management system were stored in a file which was the object of the cyber-attack. The file was protected by the MD5 encryption algorithm which, according to the DPA, is not cryptographically robust.","1.

"On 28 February 2024, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) shared information concerning two new products that Meta (the controller) planned to launch for Facebook and Instagram between 30 May and 9 June 2024. The tools were Election Day Information (EDI) and Voter Information Unit (VIU), both of which would send notifications to all eligible Instagram and Facebook users in the EU to remind them to vote in EU Parliament elections. The functionalities required users to input personal data including their name, IP address, age and gender.

The controller claimed that the products aimed to ensure that all Facebook and Instagram users who are eligible to vote see the EDI and VIU features. It argued that its legal basis for processing was the necessity of executing its contract with users.

"On 17 June 2021, the City of Copenhagen (“the controller”) reported a personal data breach to the Danish DPA (“Datatilsnynet”).

During a routine scan on 15 June 2021 of the controller’s open file drive, the controller found that there was access to a normally closed drive that contained personal data. The data included name and address information, but the files also contained information about well-being, language assessment and information about children's dental and health care. Normally, only four data warehouse developers have access to this data, but now approximately 37,500 employees in the municipality gained unauthorised access to information about up to 3.7 million people. This was due to human error as an employee with administrator access mistakenly gave too wide access to the drive during a disk swap.

The unauthorised access existed for almost two months until the controller discovered the error. The access was then closed and reported to the DPA. The controller stated there was a very low probability of an ordinary employee encountering the drive, as it required special prerequisites to find it. Network registration was turned off on the individual PCs, which meant that employees could not find the drive through ordinary searches on the PC. It also meant that the URL had to be known or the drive had to be actively scanned for. Moreover, the controller, after investigation, found that no scanning tool had been used to look for open drives during the period of the breach.

Furthermore, examination of the administrative log showed access only for people with a work-related need. However, the controller's logs of all administrative IT users' potential access to the drive only went back in time 35 days and therefore the controller could not definitively conclude that no employees other than those with a work-related need had accessed the data during the period.

The controller also stated that the majority of the files were not immediately readable for those who gained unauthorised access as this required a specific program to process the data. The controller argued that the data was thus not readable for a random administrative employee.

The controller stated that they would implement stronger safeguards to ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented to reduce the risk of future breaches and to ensure that potential breaches are detected quickly.","1.

"On 20 May 2023, the DPA carried out an on-site investigation into the operations of a company called AQAPHOTO (‘controller’), carried out the at the Līvu Akvaparks, a water amusement park. The controller’s primary activity was offering photography services to visitors (‘data subjects’) at the amusement park. For the purpose to capture and provide photographic memories, the controller hired photographers which took photos of the visitors and were recognizable by wearing yellow T-shirts saying “AQUA FOTO TEAM”. The visitors could then select their photos on the monitors located at the AQUAPHOTO booth. In addition, the controller used facial recognition technology software to identify the individuals that requested their photos and offer the pictures to them.

The controller informed about its data processing operations in 4 different forms available to the visitors. However, their privacy policy was inconsistent across these different places.

1. On the amusement’s park website, the privacy policy stated that visitors would be photographed by walking up to the photographers and then obtain their photos at the AQUAPHOTO stand.
2. The section concerning “Visitor rules” published on their website further specified that visitors with minors under their guardianship may be photographed in the amusement park. If the visitors did not wish to be photographed they had to take a distinguishing sign from the employees of the AQUAPHOTO stand.
3. On the contrary, the “Terms and Conditions of Photo Services and Personal Data Processing” posted at the company’s stand said that distinguishing sign could be obtained from the amusement park’s cash desk or the photographers hired by AQUAPHOTO.
4. By a visual information poster at the amusement park’s cash desk with a text saying: 
  * Don't be afraid of the AQUAPHOTO photographer. You do not want to be photographed in red. Green wristbands make many beautiful photographs’;
  * The posted also provided that the data subjects would not receive photographs of other visitors of the amusement park.

The DPA officers were later informed by the controller that the collection of visitors’ personal and biometric data was based on two different consents:

1. Consent during the visit – the data subjects were offered two colored wristbands before entering amusement park: green for consent to pictures and red for rejecting this processing. In this case, no biometric data processing is involved.
2. Consent after the visit – after visiting the amusement park, data subjects consented to biometric data processing, allowing the system to use facial images to recognize and select their relevant photos

In addition to these inconsistencies, the DPA’s inspection revealed that the data processing practice did not meet the data protection standard the company declared.

1. the employees of the amusement park did not inform the inspection officers about the possible processing of personal data by means of photography;
2. they did not offer the officers the option to choose between the red or green wristband to express their preference regarding this type of data processing. At the ticket office, the inspection officers also noticed a sign saying: “Don’t be afraid of the AQUAPHOTO photographer” and another one in Latvian, English and Russian: “You do not want to be photographed in red. Green wristbands make many beautiful photographs’.” However, the officers also noted that the visitors did not actually wore a green wristband. The adults wore a grey one and children wore red wristbands. Additionally, the photographs were also taken at various attractions sites, such as “Unique Tornado”, “Jacuzzi” or other attractions with pools where the wristbands were not visible;
3. the officers asked if visiting the stand before entering the amusement park was required. The cashier clarified it was not obligatory; they would be photographed during their visit and could select the photos afterward at the stand;
4. none of the visitors of the park was asked for their consent before the photographs were taken;
5. despite the fact that one of the inspection officers informed the company’s employees that they visited the park alone, they were offered to buy a photo that included both them.

The officers concluded that contrary to the information provided by the amusement park and the company, the data subjects are in fact not verbally informed about the processing of their data by the means of photography carried out on the premises of the park.

The controller claimed that the DPA should consider that the consent was collected implicitly. According to the EDPB Opinion 05/2020 consent, whether explicit or not, must be given by a statement or an explicit affirmative action and must express consent to the processing of personal data. This is complemented by recital 32 GDPR which states that consent should be given by an explicit affirmative act including oral communication. Lastly, the controller raised arguments against the DPA’s inspection at the amusement park and claimed that according to Article 15 Lithuanian Data Protection Law, any inspection must take place in cooperation with the controller. Therefore, the evidence collected should be deemed invalid.","1.

"The controller, Avanza Bank AB, used Meta’s analytics tool Meta Pixel to measure the effectiveness of the bank’s Facebook advertising. By collecting information about which pages on the controller’s website a person visited, the controller wanted to optimise its marketing measures. This tool would only collect information about a data subject’s website visits, IP addresses and information about certain unique events such as searches on the websites.

Two new functions of the analytics tool, the Automatic Advanced Matching (AAM) and the Automatic Events (AE), were activated by the controller by mistake.

The AAM looked for recognisable form fields and other sources on the controller’s website that contain information such as first name, last name and email address. It transferred data to Meta in hashed form (an irreversible one-way process that converts data into a unique string of characters) if a data subject filled in any of the five different forms of the controller’s website or mobile app. When users logged in and accepted marketing cookies, the AAM collected the personal data, including personal identification number, contact details, loan amounts on existing loans, employers, type of employment and account numbers. With this, Meta-Pixel could match the hashed data with the behaviour of data subjects to the website to obtain a more detailed profile of the data subjects. It is unknown whether this resulted in targeted advertising.

The AE analysed which buttons on the controller’s website and mobile app the user pressed and transmitted this data in plain text to Meta to then make suggestions about marketing on Facebook. However, the controller categorised visual fields as buttons on their website and mobile app. Via AE, personal data of data subjects were collected, including securities holdings and value, loan amounts, account number and email address and social security number.

The controller found out by an external source that the personal data of 500,001 to 1 million individuals were incorrectly transferred to Meta (formerly Facebook) between 15 November 2019 and 2 June 2021 by accidentally turning on these two functions of Meta Pixel. The controller, afterwards, could not determine who and how these functions were turned on.

On June 8, 2021, the Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten - ""IMY"") received the data breach notification from the controller.

The controller argued that the transfer of the data did not entail any harm or risk to the data subjects, as Meta did not use the data for its own purposes or transfer it further, and the data was erased after a request by the controller. All data was transferred by Meta pixel to Meta and the controller's own advertising account with Meta.","1.

"The Finnish DPA was notified that a bus operator (the controller) had published the personal phone numbers of its bus drivers on the company intranet, although the drivers also had a personal business phone provided by the controller. The DPA then asked the controller to explain the purpose for which it processed the personal phone numbers of its drivers.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it published the personal phone numbers of its drivers in the company's intranet telephone directory because it was necessary for the drivers to be able to communicate with each other by phone while on duty. The controller emphasised that each employee had a personal password for the intranet in order to ensure the technical protection of personal data. In the controller's view, the processing was based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as it was necessary for the performance of the employment contract.

Regarding the separate business phones, the controller stated that they were primarily intended for mobile data use only, as the use of the phone was restricted so that it could only be used to make calls to specifically authorised numbers, such as supervisors and emergency numbers. It was therefore impossible to communicate with other drivers during the working day using only the business phone.","1.

"The controller is an Italian municipality which decided to implement a mobile application. This application was made available on app stores between December 2020 and January 2021. It allowed citizens to send notifications to the Local Police about unsafe areas. After getting this notification, the Police could use the video surveillance system to monitor the area.

"The controller, a health authority, sent an email to 45 data subjects containing instructions on how to get medications used to cure multiple sclerosis. The person sending the email put the email addresses of the recipients in the “cc” field instead of choosing the “bcc” one. This resulted in the email addresses of the data subject being disclosed to each other.

After receiving a report by one of the data subject, the controller made a data breach notification to the DPA according to Article 33(1) GDPR.

The controller argued that the data breach happened due to a human mistake and that it had repeatedly instructed its employees to use the “bcc” field when sending emails to multiple people.

Moreover, the controller pointed out that the number of data subjects concerned was quite low and that the breach lasted for a short period of time.","1.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that no passwords were used to log in to its golf app, but rather the individual's membership number, the first two letters of their first and last name and their year of birth. The Golf Union membership number consists of a country part, a club part and a membership number, e.g. fi-123-4321, of which the last 4 digits make up the actual membership number.

The controller considered that the login policy was adequate from a security perspective. The controller stated that obtaining the information required for login required research from several sources and could not be directly deduced by a third party.

"AFIANZA ASESORES, S.L. is a consultancy company engaged in, among other work, the provision of legal advice. A USB stick with a large amount of personal data, including data pertaining to a criminal proceeding, was stolen. The USB was not encrypted.

The controller conducted an internal investigation. It informed the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of the incident 13 days after its occurrence. On 2 July 2021, the AEPD ordered the controller to communicate the breach to data subjects.

On 24 June 2022, the AEPD initiated sanctioning proceedings against the controller and proposed a sanction of €160,000. The AEPD considered that the controller had suffered a breach resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The AEPD noted that it considered the controller’s storage of personal data on a removable device without encryption negligent, resulting in an aggravating factor for the fine.

The controller argued that there was no evidence that a third party had ever accessed the information contained in the USB. Instead, the infringing ‘disclosure’ or ‘breach’ was entirely hypothetical. Thus, the controller argued, it could not be proved that any third party ever improperly accessed the information contained in the USB and no breach of confidentiality could be demonstrated.

The controller also argued that it protected its data diligently and had adequate security measures in place. For instance, all personnel with access to personal data were instructed of their obligations and responsibilities. It also conducted IT audits to verify appropriate measures and security standards in place. The controller emphasised that Article 32 GDPR does not regulate a closed list of security measures – instead, it requires the controller to apply appropriate measures. It thus challenged the focus of the sanctioning proceedings on the absence of encryption on the USB because it was not an obligatory security measure and this did not take account of the controller’s other security measures. Penalising this, the controller argued, was contrary to the principle of culpability.

The controller also defended its delay in notifying the AEPD of the breach, stating that in the 13 days it conducted an internal investigation. It argued that the 72 hour period articulated in Article 33 GDPR is not imperative.","1.

Initially, the controller didn’t find the source of data breach. However, after in-depth analysis of third-party specialist, it turned out that lack of company’s software update led to the breach – there was an exploit within the software, making it possible to gain exterbal control over one of the devices connected to the software.

"A Swedish pharmacy company - Apoteket AB (the controller) was using the Meta pixel for marketing purposes since 2017. The purpose of the pixel was to measure the controller’s marketing activity within Facebook and Instagram and additionally to promote controller’s products to visitors of certain pages (self-care product category). By default, the controller disabled the pixel within the part of the website dedicated to the prescription goods. At the same time, the pixel collected the data about other products offered by the controller, in particular products to treat variety of disorders (for example allergy or stomach disorder) or sexual wellness products.

In 2020, an employee of controller, acting without the authorisation or knowledge of the controller, activated Advanced Matching function of the pixel. The employee was one of three employees managing the pixel within the controller structure. As a result, the controller was provided with supplementary data, which was not necessary for the purposes of data processing, as the pixel collected more data referring to the customers. Additionally, the additional data was transferred to Meta.

When a customer made a purchase with the controller, Meta received hashed data related to the customer, namely the contact data, name and surname, social security data, address data. Meta was then able to match the data with Facebook user ID and eventually deleted the hashed data. The estimated number of data subjects affected by the incident was up to 930,000.

As soon as the controller identified the new settings of the pixel (2022), they disabled the Advanced Matching function. The controller requested Meta to delete the data collected via the pixel. Meta explained they already deleted the data older than two years ago and regarding a newer data, Meta claimed to be unable to delete them manually. Additionally, the controller published an announcement on their website, informing the data subjects about the current situation. Moreover, the controller implemented new technical and organisational measures to reduce the risk of future violations of that kind (inter alia, additional screening of cookie settings of the website, e-learning course for the employees).

"IDA Forsikring Forsikringsformidling F.M.B.A. (a controller) is a Danish insurance company.

To improve the controller’s customer services, including their quality, as well, to assess the employees’ performance, the controller was recording incoming telephone calls of customer service.

The audio files with recordings were analysed and converted into a text by a data processor. For this purpose, the processor used a speech recognizing software. The software was developed by the processor for past 8 years to optimize the analysis. According to the processor, the conversation recordings were not used in order to train the software.

In order to analyse the employees’ conduct during calls with customers, the software picked up the word used by the employees. This was because the controller implemented a dedicated policy (“conversation tree”) to standardize contact with their customers. Hence, once the analysis was done, the call was assigned with a quality score. Consequently, the controller created and developed a list of positive and negative words (a dictionary) based on experience from approximately 30 million calls. However, according to the processor, the conversation recordings were not used in order to train the software.

Additionally, the analysis of call let the controller to create a statistics on number of inquiries regarding specific topics. The statistical data allowed the controller to improve the customer service (for example by updated the FAQ section). Moreover, using the statistical data the controller was able to better know the clients behaviour and accordingly adapt their marketing and customer services, for example change the content of the newsletter bearing in mind the actual interest of the customers.

The controller claimed they did not use the software to profile employees or customers, since the controller was analysing the conversation, not the individual.

Due to the subject of services provided by the controller, the conversation included various personal data of customers, inter alia, identification data, financial data, details on the insurance policy and in some cases data related to health. For the employees the basic scope of personal data processed covered name, surname, e-mail address, voice.

The abovementioned data processing attracted the attention of media. For that reason, the controller reviewed the processing activities related to the analysis of conversation. Regarding the legal basis of data processing for that purpose, the controller indicated on the consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR for the customers, and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the employees.

The documents contained the following personal data: name, surname, national identification number (PESEL), financial data (clients’ assets), account number, ID number.

According to the controller, the other bank sent back all the documents. The documents’ integrity was not affected, yet it was probable that the other bank’s employees read the documents. As the documents confidentiality was violated, a data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR occurred. Nevertheless, the controller was of the opinion that the risk posed by the breach was minimised by the statutory bank secrecy. Because of that, the controller didn't see a reason to notify the data subjects in accordance with Article 34 GDPR.

However, the controller notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about the data breach.

During the following proceedings, the DPA requested the controller to notify the data subjects involved about the breach under Article 34 GDPR. The controller asked the DPA to reconsider their request. The controller emphasised the documents were shared with the other bank, the controller’s business partner, which should be treated as “a trusted party”. That was because the other bank, together with the controller, were part of banking sector in Poland. As such, both the controller and the other bank pursue highly regulated business activity, in particular in the field of data protection and cybersecurity.

"Since 2018, the University of Agder (the controller) was using MS Teams and Sharepoint.

The controller’s employee found out that an open MS Teams’ folder gave all the employees and students access to documents contacting personal data. For example, four documents referred to 4,851 employees and 10,419 external persons (back to 2014) who were mentioned by name, national identity number, employee number, resignation date and organisational unit. Moreover, other documents consisted of, for example, an exam overview of 568 students or personal data of 64 Ukrainian refugees.

After receiving the notification from the employee, the controller immediately changed the access setting of the MS Teams’ folders. The new setting required each employee willing to access the folder to be approved by the folder's owner.

The controller notified about the incident under Article 33 GDPR the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) and according to Article 34 GDPR affected data subjects. Additionally, the controller published its detailed description on the controller’s website. However, the log control was limited only to 6 months back. The controller was unable to confirm if the employees and students interacted with or downloaded the data.","1.

"On 6 July 2022, the Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) initiated an investigation on its own against Dansk Retursystem (a controller). The controller is an entity managing the system of cans and bottles deposits - pant. The DPA had been made aware that the controller had developed an application called ""Pant"" (the App) for the payment of deposit. In connection with the App, the controller processed a number of information about, among other things, the users' bank accounts, balances, loans, etc.

The investigation showed that the App had a built-in component allowing a user to log in their bank  to obtain the user's account information in order to pay out money to the right account. The component was made available by a third party and integrated with the App. The component could also collect information about e.g. user's balances, identity information and transaction history. However, this information was not passed on to the controller.

The DPA decided to limit the investigation of the App to the questions of:

(i) whether the controller's processing of personal data in connection with the use of the App took place in accordance with the principles for processing personal data, including the principle of legality, reasonableness and transparency in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the data minimization principle in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR; and

(ii) whether the processing took place in accordance with Article 25 (1) GDPR, as regards the implementation of the data protection principles.

Against this background, the DPA requested the controller for an opinion regarding the App. In his clarifications, the controller affirmed that they have developed the App to modernize the process of deposit payouts, transitioning from physical cards to direct bank transfers. The App required users to register and link a bank account for deposit payments. For this purpose the controller relied on services offered by Tink AB, a payment-service-provider. The controller integrated with Tink's solution to facilitate account selection securely. Tink, acting as a separate data controller initially, gathered extensive data including account numbers, balances, and transaction history, which are crucial for specifying payment details but were not retained by the controller.

To provide flexibility and address operational concerns, the controller introduced a manual option for account linking that bypasses third-party services like Tink. This manual process lacks the validation that comes with the automated system but offers an alternative for users during bank system failures or for those preferring not to use Tink.

The controller emphasized its role as a data controller once account information is received from Tink, responsible for ensuring data processing aligns with GDPR requirements. The App's design focused on minimal data collection essential for its function, avoiding unnecessary storage or processing of sensitive personal information such as addresses or social security numbers.","1.

"The controller provided remote psychic services via telephone, online chat or text message. On some of its websites, the controller offered personalized chats via telephone carried out by its partner. In order to promote their services, the two companies sent marketing messages to existing and prospective customers via e-mail and text. Prospective customers' contact details were obtained through a contact form on either of the two companies’ websites. The controller and its partner set up a shared database for their marketing purposes which on the 6 October 2022 included personal data of more than 1.5 million people.

On 15 November 2021, the French DPA (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés - CNIL) carried out an online check of five websites run by the controller and its partner. An on-site inspection was also carried out on 7 and 8 December 2021 at the premises of the two companies. The following details the findings of the investigation:

1)	Data retention period proportionate to the purpose of processing under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR

The controller retained the data of its customers for a period of six years after the end of the commercial relationship. The controller argued that this is necessary so that it would be able to respond to possible judicial investigations.

Users must enter their sex, date, time and city of birth, as well as their e-mail address, but also the sex and date of birth of their partner. During the remote consultations, a plethora of personal information may be disclosed by the customers. These conversations are recorded by the controller's partner and half of the data is stored until the end of the working day and the other half stored for a period of six months.

The controller argued that this sensitive data is not processed but simply recorded.

3)	Processing for marketing purposes under Article L.34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code (Article L.34-5 Code des postes et des communication électroniques)

While users could follow a link which provided some additional information, this link was located much further down on the form. Further, the information included in the link did not mention commercial advertising at all.

During the proceedings the controller changed the format of the contact form to include a very small unintelligible character attached to a word on the form. A click on this character then lead to a footnote which was not visible on the original form listing the controller as the provider of marketing messages.

"On March 31, 2020, INPS changed it CDN technology (Content Delivery Network is a system that uses servers located in different places to deliver web content quickly to users around the world) to handle a large number of people accessing its website at the same time, especially important during the high-demand times caused by the COVID-19 pandemic benefits.

However, during the setup, it led to caching errors that allowed unauthorized access to personal data for about 30 minutes. Instead of just showing users their own information, the system ended up showing some user's personal information to others if they visited the website during that time period. This happened because some pages that contained sensitive information were not excluded from caching.

On April 1, 2020, the new system went live, and almost immediately, it was discovered that the system allowed unauthorized access to claims applications. On the same day, INPS notified Garante regarding the CDN data breaches that occurred because of incorrect caching configurations that led to unauthorized access to personal data by displaying cached personal data to other users. This data breach involved personal details displayed on the INPS portal, such as tax codes, names, addresses, and email contacts, among other information.

On April 2, 2020, another breach happened in the context of emergency measures during the pandemic, specifically around the application process for a babysitting service bonus that began on April 1, 2020. Due to the hurried implementation and simplified access measures (like a simplified PIN system), the application procedure did not adequately differentiate between different user types. As a result, some users were wrongly granted access levels typically reserved for authorized intermediaries (like patronages), allowing them to view, modify, or submit applications that contained personal data.

The policy explicitly states that covered entities must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing (Article 32).
4. The policy also states that the controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with dispositions concerning notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority (Article 33).
5. The policy further states that when the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay. The communication to the data subject shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained, the likely consequences of the personal data breach, and the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects (Article 34).

9. The policy also states that if the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that 'the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption' (Article 34).
10. The policy also states that if the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that 'the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects is no longer likely to materialise' (Article 34).
11. The policy also states that if the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that 'it would involve disproportionate effort.

"An individual, being a sole entrepreneur (the controller) was attacked with a ransomware software. The attackers encrypted the personal data of the controller’s customers and employees, approximately 200 people. The encrypted data consisted of, in particular, the national identification number (PESEL), name and surname, address, current account number, e-mail and phone number. Shortly after the attack, the controller restored access to the data. The identity of the attackers remained unknown.

The controller indicated that the breach happened due to a human error. Supposedly, one of the controller’s employees turned off the antivirus software. Moreover, the attackers also used the server’s vulnerability. The controller explained that a third party, responsible for the server maintenance and IT services (the processor), failed to update the server’s software for certain time. That made the vulnerability being present when the data breach took place.

The controller notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about the data breach. Due to immediate restoration of data access, the controller found the breach didn’t result in high risk to the data subjects’ rights and freedoms. Allegedly, the attackers’ only purpose was to obtain ransom from the controller in exchange for access to the data, not to access and to share the data. Initially, the controller didn’t notify the data subjects under Article 34 GDPR, because of the technical and organisational measures implemented in response to the breach. Eventually, a month following the DPA notification, the controller notified the data subject by publishing an announcement within their premises.

The DPA found no evidence that the data confidentiality was not affected by the breach. Thus, the DPA ordered the controller to notify the data subjects again.

"In this case the controller is Foodinho a food delivery company managing the service “Glovo” in Italy. This company is owned by Glovoapp23 SA, a Spanish holding. The DPA started its investigation following the death of one of its employees while he was delivering food.

The controller uses an online platform provided by Glovo ES (appointed as processor) to manage its employees and the deliveries. This platform allows to see a map of every place in the World where Glovo operates and the live location of each employee. The controller, by clicking on a “rider”, can view their location, the time slots in which they are available, the deliveries they performed and the track they followed.

The investigation showed that this geolocation function was active, in some cases, even outside working hours and when the app was not active. Moreover, the controller implemented a facial recognition function for identity verification purposes, provided by a processor, Jumio Corporation. According to this procedure, the data subjects (employees) needed to upload an ID card and take a selfie of themselves. After that, the data subjects were asked to take a selfie in random occasions. If they refused to do so, their possibility of getting further delivery time slots was blocked.

The controller argued that this processing was necessary to comply with Article 23 of the applicable collective agreement, stating that it’s forbidden for the employees to be replaced by a third party.

Furthermore, the investigation showed that the controller’s software allowed to rate the data subjects. The controller argued that this rating function is not active for Italy.","1.

"On the 25 June 2018, the Irish DPA (Data Protection Commission - DPC) began an ex-officio investigation into the controller, a local County Council (Sligo).

The controller had installed CCTV cameras at bottle banks and in housing estates stating that they were to aid the enforcement of the Irish Litter Pollution Act 1997 and to help detect anti-social behaviour. The cameras therefore constantly filmed public and private areas This video footage was then stored by the controller. The controller could not demonstrate any records of logs regarding the data processing and it was unclear for how long the data was stored.

The cameras, as they were installed in public spaces filmed passers-by and individuals using nearby facilities such as a community centre. Some of the monitoring screens were in public spaces (such as the community centre) and could therefore be accessed by unauthorised persons. One CCTV footage monitor was not password protected while another had the capability to log all access to the system but staff had not been trained to use this function.","1.

"In September 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) launched two inquiries into data processing activities of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, here the controller.

In July 2017, Meta implemented a so-called “View-as” function on Facebook which allowed users to see their own Facebook page as it would appear to another user. The function included a video upload feature which created so-called “user tokens”. User tokens are coded IDs which are used to verify users and can control access to platform features as well as personal data. Users could therefore use these tokens to gain access to other accounts.

Between the 14 and 18 September 2018, third parties caused a major data breach by using the tokens to log on as other Facebook account holders. The data breach impacted approximately 29,000,000 Facebook users globally of which 3,000,000 were based in the EU/EEA.

"Energya VM received several complaints from data subjects alleging they had been contacted by Nivalco, which offered energy services. The individuals making these calls had access to the customers' personal data. In response, Energya VM held a meeting with Nivalco to clarify the purpose of the calls and the discounts being offered. An internal audit revealed that most of the calls targeted customers who had canceled their agreements within the initial days of the contract. Under their contractual arrangement, Nivalco was responsible for promoting Energya VM’s services and managing a database containing the personal information of individuals and businesses for marketing purposes.

Energya VM denied responsibility for Nivalco’s data processing practices, asserting that Nivalco independently obtained and managed the personal data and autonomously decided its use. Energya also argued that its lack of access to the database prevented effective supervision. However, during its investigation, the AEPD found that Energya VM had provided Nivalco with instructions regarding the processing of personal data, undermining Energya’s claims of non-involvement.

"KASPR runs a Chrome browser extension which allows users to get the business details of people whose LinkedIn profile they had visited. On the 28 July 2022, the French DPA (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés – CNIL) carried out a compliance check with KASPR, the controller.

The investigation showed that approximately 160 million contacts were included in the controller’s database. These entries included the surname, first name, e-mail address, telephone number, LinkedIn profile URL or other social networks, employer, company, job title, skills, professional interest, career, date of hiring and end of post, training, place of work, source of data and date of collection.

Harvesting the data from LinkedIn and storage

On LinkedIn, users can choose between four different visibility options: 1 – Only visible to me, 2 – Anyone on LinkedIn, 3 – 1st degree connections and 4 – 1st and 2nd degree connections.

The controller collected the contacts details of LinkedIn users who had made their details visible to all (Option 2) as well as those whom had limited the visibility to 1st and 2nd degree connections (Options 3&4).

Providing information

Four years after the implementation of the KASPR tool, the controller notified data subjects by sending an email which informed them of the practice and gave the option to object to the processing by clicking on a link in the email.  When data subjects filed access requests under Article 15 GDPR, the controller merely responded that their personal information was retrieved from publicly available sources.

The controller’s argument

The controller argued that the processing is based on its legitimate interest to facilitate connection between working professionals aligning with the intentions of data subjects active on LinkedIn. Further, it argued that identity verification should reasonably be expected by users of a professional networking service and that data was collected according to the selected options on LinkedIn.","1.

"The controller is an insurance company. On 5 October 2022, the controller experienced high traffic on one of its servers, namely the one hosting the client managing tool. The controller noticed that an unauthorised third party stole the login details of an insurance broker and used them to access the platform.

The controller investigated the matter and came to the conclusion that the breach at hand affected 37 data subjects, i.e. only the data subjects that were being handled by the controller’s broker whose login details were stolen.

The controller did not have a log system tracking the logins and, therefore, was not able to identify the entity of the attack. However, it deemed that the data breach was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and, thus, did not notify the DPA pursuant to Article 33(1) GDPR.

However, on 11 November 2022, it was noticed that a database containing a sample of 24315 records concerning personal data of the controller’s former clients was being sold on a Telegram group.

At the same time, the controller discovered that, due to a bug on its IT system, the third party that performed the attack could not only access the data of that specific broker’s clients, but also the data of all the other clients of the controller. This data involved name, national number, telephone number, date and place of birth, civil status and IBAN.

At this point, the controller performed a new assessment of the risks involved by the data breach, deeming that it was indeed necessary to notify both the DPA and the data subjects involved.

Therefore, the DPA opened an investigation on this matter. Moreover, some data subjects filed a complaint with the DPA.","1. The case involves a covered entity (the insurance company) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

"A controller decided to start a new website, using their own server. Within the controller’s structure, IT tasks, including the management of the website and other systems, were outsourced to another company, acting as a processor.

An error of a configuration file led to unauthorised disclosure of an old website folder. The folder contained personal data of 21.453 individuals, both clients and employees of the controller. The disclosed data consisted of name surname, birthdate, address, e-mail address, phone number, national identification number (PESEL) and encrypted website-user passwords.

During the proceedings, the controller provided the DPA with all the documents covering their business relation with the processor, including its post-breach statements. In one of the documents, the processor stated that the breach was a result of their employee error. The controller claimed the processor to be liable for the breach, because the erroneous sever configuration caused the breach. Furthermore, the processor didn’t monitor the server activities as expected, failing to prevent the breach.

The processing contract between the parties didn’t include the personal data processed on the website. Also, the controller didn’t inform the processor that the website was used to process the personal data related to the controller’s services.

"In 2022, the French DPA (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés – CNIL) received complaints about the operators of a real-estate company (the controller) filed by employees of the company. The complaints related to monitoring procedures implemented by the company. The complaints lacked concrete evidence of violations of the GDPR so the CNIL started an investigation.

Investigation

The CNIL found that the company was consistently recording its employees by capturing both image and sound via two cameras which monitored workspace but also recreational spaces. The live footage could be viewed via a mobile phone app on the supervisor’s phone. The controller had put up a sign with a camera pictogram with the words “video-monitored space” on one of the doors. No other information had been supplied to employees.

The controller also implemented a software used when employees worked from home. This software counted working hours and discerned inactivity periods. This meant that the system would register inactivity anytime an employee had not hit the keyboard or used the mouse in more than 3 to 15 minutes. These inactivity periods were registered and if employees failed to compensate for the “time lost”, they were subject to pay deductions.

Additionally, the software recorded whether employees visited “productive” or “unproductive” websites, which were determined as such by the controller. Every 3 to 15 minutes, the software took screenshots of the employees’ screens.

The controller allowed shared access to the administrator account of the software meaning that it was impossible to track who had used the admin account. The admin account had extensive viewing rights and could therefore access large amounts of personal data.

Controller arguments

The controller brought forward that employees could also manually track their working time instead without any negative consequences. It explained that it had orally informed the employees of the functioning of the software. Further, it detailed that it only used the software for two and a half months and then uninstalled it.","1.

"The controller (Capital Area Health Care Centre) runs multiple health centers. Following findings from procedures against another organisation, the DPA initiated an ex-officio investigation against the controller's processing of personal data in joined medical record systems maintained pursuant to national law (the Medical Records Act).

Such sharing agreements require a licensing both by the DPA and the responsible Ministry under the Medical Records Act.

"The Italian supervisory authority investigated the cookie practices of the www.onlinestore.it website on its own volition. The website belonged to e-commerce company Società Onlinestore S.r.l. (the data controller).

The website’s cookie banner stated that the website used cookies (including third-party cookies) to offer a better browser experience and that users could edit their cookie preferences.

The banner included three options: “Accept”, “Customize”, and “Learn more”. The banner included no option to reject cookies and no “X” icon to close the banner. The “Customized” option opened a drop-down menu with preferences for both necessary cookies and profiling cookies. Profiling cookies were pre-selected by default and could be de-selected by the user.

The authority tested the website and found that the same number of cookies were placed regardless of user preference.

"In 2020 the Italian DPA fined telecom Wind Tre, the controller, €16,729,600 for the unlawful processing of personal data and unauthorised marketing communications to customers. The authority also ordered the controller to stop processing data acquired without consent.

Months later the DPA started a follow-up investigation of the company’s compliance with their orders. In particular, the DPA investigated the controller’s reliance on marketing subcontractors, its use of “cold lists” of contact data, and the collection and documentation of consumer's consent.

Additionally, the decision addressed several complaints against the controller over aggressive marketing practices.

The ex-officio investigation (procedure 178557)

The ex-officio investigation started in 2022 as a follow-up to the DPA’s 2020 decision against the controller. The DPA investigated the controller’s premises and requested information over certain features of its marketing systems and over the operations of its subcontractors.

The DPA found that 15 contracts were finalized with different numbers from those targeted by the controller’s campaign. These contracts were finalized by three different contractors (all of which qualified as processors under the GDPR). By hiring each processor, the controller violated several provisions of the GDPR. First, the controller was unable to prove that the data subjects were contacted with their consent. Second, two processors violated the controller’s established storage periods for customer data. Finally, one of the processors was established in Moldova and did not have an EU representative.

The use of cold lists bought from third-party websites raised compliance issues. The controller was unable to prove the consent to the use of numbers bought for third-party websites. Additionally, a single phone number was bought without the data subject’s consent.

Over time the data controller implemented several measures to bring its marketing activities into compliance, including:

* a new campaign management system to better track the operations of contractors;
* a quality control system to ensure compliance along the value chain;
* more rigorous selections and auditing of contractors;
* measures to protect its customers from CLI spoofing calls.

Crucially, the controller also stopped using “cold lists” for consumer marketing in December 2022.

The first complaint (procedure 133372)

The first complaint comes from a customer of the data controller, the data subject. When she activated the controller’s services, she denied all consents to marketing communications.

The data subject later consented to direct marketing from a third party, the processor. The controller had engaged this third party as a data processor. As a result, the data subject still received marketing communications for the controller’s services despite having denied her consent to the controller.

The second complaint (procedure 25395)

In 2021, a data subject received an unwanted SMS. He reached out to the controller and asked for his number to be blacklisted but kept receiving messages afterwards.

The controller claimed that it blacklisted the data subject and that the unwanted communications were caused by an unpredictable human error. It also claimed that its new Campaign Management system would prevent similar incidents in the future.

The third complaint (procedure 262138)

A misconfiguration in the controller’s Customer Relationship Management system resulted in a data breach on the controller’s website: a customer logged into another customer’s personal area after accidentally using the wrong client code.

The controller immediately fixed the vulnerability but did not notify the breach to the authority.","1. The case involves a covered entity (Wind Tre) and an individual (the data subject) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).

Each of the tombstones contains the same first name (which is a name traditionally assigned to stillborn children in Italian Catholic tradition), and different surnames, which correspond to the surname of the data subjects, who are the women who interrupted their pregnancy and the men who these women conceived the fetus with. The DPA found that, in the vast majority of cases, these data subjects did not know about the burial site and of the use of their surnames.

Additionally, the preliminary investigation of the DPA revealed that, in the online portal of the cemetery, it was possible to find the precise location of each tombstone by typing in the name and surname thereon written.

"After the Bank of Italy notified the DPA of a personal data breach, the DPA decided to start an ex officio investigation. The notification concerned requests for information advanced by the legal representative of a credit repair company to the databases of national banks. Credit repair consists of finding and fixing mistakes on your credit report to boost one's credit score. The legal representative was appointed as processor, while the credit rehabilitation company was the controller.

All these access requests concerned natural persons, the data subjects, who did not give any authorization for the search.

The DPA advanced a request for information to the controller, which remained unanswered. Thus, the DPA started an investigation, which revealed the following.

First, the controller deals primarily with the erasure of credit reports by banks. Data subjects reach out to the controller through their website. Subsequently, the controller calls the data subject about this service.

Second, when the controller calls the data subject, the controller gives information on data processing by means of a prerecorded voice to give the data subjects an overview on the services offered. Then, if the data subjects accepted, their data is collected. However, not all data present in the database was collected from the data subjects.

Third, the Privacy Policy is shared, first, with the data subjects via telephone, on the date of the the first phone contact and, for the second time, when they fill out a form on “mandate to act” in public and private central credit rating centers.

Fourth, the controller’s database revealed that:

* The controller's IT system contains data regarding 74,214 data subjects. This data includes: name, surname, place and data of birth, social security number and contact details.
* In each customer file, there are also the reports provided, by the companies and banking institutions, in response to requests for access made by the controller through the processor.
* In the IT system, personal data held by other credit rehabilitation companies could be consulted for insolvency recovery purposes.
* The aforementioned data, collected via paper forms, was given by every customer and was stored in the controller's office.

Finally, there were no systematic procedures for periodic deletion of old data. The controller retained the complete paper files and digital records, even if it no longer had any contractual relationship with those data subjects.","1.

"Various violations were identified:

1. Improper Disposal of Test Results In a medical practice offering COVID-19 tests, employees disposed of positive and negative antigen test results in a garbage bag next to a public glass recycling container. The documents contained sensitive health data under Article 9 GDPR and were accessible to unauthorized third parties. Despite acknowledging the increased burden on medical practices during the pandemic, the Hamburg DPA deemed this handling of health data unacceptable. A fine of €1,000 was imposed, which the practice accepted.

2. Refusal to Grant Data Deletion Requests A dedicated COVID-19 test center consistently ignored individuals’ requests for data deletion, violating Article 17 GDPR. Even after the Hamburg DPA intervened and initiated administrative proceedings, the test center refused to comply. Due to the systematic nature of the violation, the Hamburg DPA imposed a fine of €1,000, which the test center accepted.

3. Unsecured Online Access to Test Results Another test center provided test results via unencrypted email containing a direct URL to a PDF file. The URL structure included the tested person’s last name, making it easy to access other individuals' results by modifying the URL. This was a clear violation of Article 32(1) GDPR, as the test center failed to implement appropriate security measures. The Hamburg DPA imposed a fine of €2,700.

4. Unlawful Storage of ID Card Copies A fourth test center scanned and stored both the front and back of tested individuals' ID cards on an external hard drive. This exceeded the legal requirements for documentation under the German Coronavirus Testing Regulation. There was no legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR for storing complete ID card copies, and the practice posed a significant security risk. The test center did not cooperate with the Hamburg DPA to address the issue, leading to a fine of approximately €1,400.","1.

"The Italian data protection authority received many complaints of aggressive telemarketing practices carried out on behalf of energy company Energia Pulita S.r.l. (the data controller). Some of the complainants reported deceitful marketing practices. Others were called despite their number’s inclusion in Italy’s Do Not Call registry.

In November 2023 the authority started a broad investigation on the controller. Additionally, the authority required information about all of the purchase offers from February 5 to February 12 2024.

Privacy compliance and quality controls

The authority inquired about the measures taken by the data controller to ensure privacy compliance both in its own marketing activities, and in the marketing activities of its subcontractors (acting as data processors or sub-processors).

The controller implemented some technical and organizational measures to implement data protection principles, including quality check calls and checks for the recipient’s consent to marketing. Starting March 2024, the controller implemented a more robust privacy compliance program: for instance, the controller provided its employees with privacy training, and adopted more robust privacy standards for its contractors.

The authority found these measures to be insufficient. The authority held that the data controller failed to vigilate over the privacy practices of its subcontractors. Additionally, the controller failed to choose subcontractors with robust privacy practices. In this regard, the authority pointed out that it still received complaints about aggressive marketing on behalf of the controller after March 2024.

The authority also observed that controllers must adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the implementation of data protection principles from the very beginning of the data processing (data protection by default).

Consent and the Do Not Call registry

The data controller pointed out that some of the recipients (the data subjects) consented to the processing of their data for marketing purposes after their inclusion in the Do Not Call Registry. These consents were collected via four third-party websites where users provided their personal data in order to receive commercial offers. In the controller’s view, the data subjects’ consents authorized its marketing calls.

The authority found issues with the consents. Three websites (nuoveofferte.com, offertenergetiche.it, and ricercaofferte.it) prompted users to consent to marketing for a very broad range of products and services. After consent collection, personal data were shared with an undefined number of companies for marketing purposes, each acting as the data controller. Additionally, users could not choose the form of the marketing communications they would receive. A fourth website (Offerte-gas-luce.it) lacked a privacy notice altogether.

For these reasons, the authority held that the websites did not collect granular and free consent. In this regard, the authority referred to its own guidance on telemarketing.

The data controller also defended its practices by pointing out that energy contracts were not concluded over the phone: the phone calls only served to initiate contact and to direct prospective customers to the controller's website. For this reason, the controller argued that the calls were not a form of telemarketing and did not fall under the Italian rules on the Do Not Call registry.

The authority rejected the controller’s argument. In the authority’s view, calls that merely initiate contract with the customer, are nonetheless telemarketing. In this regard, the authority referred to the Code of Conduct on telemarketing and teleselling.

Job candidates and privacy notices

The authority inquired on the provision of information to the controller’s job applicants.

Individuals could apply for a job with the controller by providing personal data on its website. Initially, the controller would provide applicants with a privacy notice before the job interview. The data controller provided no notice at a collection and provided no information at all to applicants who did not show up for the job interview.

The data controller eventually improved its practices. Starting July 2024, the data controller started providing applicants with a notice at collection.

The authority held that the data controller violated its transparency obligations until July 2024. Additionally, the authority held that the controller did not correctly identify the legal bases for processing applicant’s data in the earlier version of its privacy notice.","1.

"In an investigation of their own volition, the Data Protection Commission (Irish DPA) launched an inquiry into the lawfulness of TikTok’s (controller) transfers of personal data of EEA users to China. The inquiry also looked at TikTok’s compliance with their transparency requirements.

Throughout the investigation, TikTok maintained that they did not store EEA user data on their Chinese servers. In April 2025, TikTok corrected this and informed the DPC that due to an error, some EEA user data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers, but this was no longer the case.

During the investigation, TikTok claimed that transfers via remote access do not require a transfer mechanism as mandated under Article 46(1) GDPR. In an assessment of Chinese laws provided by TikTok to the DPC during the investigation, TikTok had themselves identified that the Chinese legal framework would preclude a finding of “essential equivalence”, as required, in addition to the adoption of appropriate safeguards and supplementary measures. In this assessment, TikTok made reference to the Chinese Anti-Terrorism Law, the Counter-Espionage Law, the Cybersecurity Law and the National Intelligence Law.

"In April 2020, the Polish Prime Minister decided to hold elections for the President of the Republic of Poland by postal voting. He instructed the Polish Post S.A. (Post) to prepare the organisation for the elections. The Post requested from the Minister of Digitalisation (Minister) citizens personal data collected in the Register of the Universal Electronic Population Registration System (PESEL Register) for the purpose of creating a database of voters' addresses for the delivery of packages.

The Minister provided the personal data of approximately 30 million people. More specifically; the PESEL number (a unique 11-digit identifier), the first names, the surnames, the last current address of permanent residence registration, the address of temporary residence registration, as well as the currently registered temporary departure outside the country of all living persons of legal age with a registered Polish citizenship.

The Post continued to process the data for the purposes of the organisation of the general election up until their deletion in May 2020.

In April 2020, the Ombudsman for Civil Rights Protection filed a complaint to the Provincial Administrative Court of Warsaw (WSA) against the aforementioned decision of the Polish Prime Minister and in May 2020 against the Minister's action to provide the personal data.

Following the complaints, the WSA, in 2021, and the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland (NSA), in 2024, issued their final judgments. They declared the Minister's action of April 2020 to provide the Post with access to personal data from the PESEL register ineffective. Both courts held that there was no legal basis under polish law for conducting the 2020 presidential election exclusively by correspondence and therefore no legal basis for issuing an order that would oblige one to take steps to prepare to carry them out. Also, the courts stated that the Post and the Minister were obliged to verify whether the request of the Prime Minister was justified.

In 2025, the DPA deemed it necessary to initiate proceedings ex officio.

The Minister claimed that, according to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful when it is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation incumbent on the controller, while the Post claimed that its actions were not unlawful.","1. The case involves a covered entity (the Minister) and an individual (the citizens of Poland) as per the policy's definition of covered entities (Article 1).
2. The case describes a situation where the covered entity (the Minister) provided personal data of the individuals (the citizens of Poland) to a third party (the Post) for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected (Article 6).
3. The policy explicitly states that processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1) (Article 6).
4. The policy also states that the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia: any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller; the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10; the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation (Article 6).
5. In this case, the Minister provided personal data of the individuals (the citizens of Poland) to a third party (the Post) for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected without a legal basis under Polish law for conducting the 2020 presidential election exclusively by correspondence and therefore no legal basis for issuing an order that would oblige one to take steps to prepare to carry them out.

"US company Luka Inc. (the controller) made available Replika, a chatbot based on generative AI. Replika was meant to be a virtual companion that could help users track their mood, cope with stress, and work out their emotional and psychological problems. Replika could be configured to fulfil various roles, including therapist and romantic partner.

Replika gained attention from international media after it allegedly encouraged minors to engage in self-harm. The news prompted an ex officio investigation from the DPA.

In early 2023 the Italian DPA ordered the controller to halt the processing of personal data of all users in Italy, as a precautionary measure. In this early phase of the procedure, the DPA found evidence of possible GDPR violations and reserved the right to investigate further.

Months later the DPA lifted the ban on the condition that the controller took steps to ensure Replika’s compliance with data protection law, including implementing an effective age verification system to prevent minors from accessing the service. The controller made Replika available again after the ban was lifted.

In May 2025 the DPA issued a final decision and closed the procedure. The DPA reserved the right to further investigate certain aspects of the case in a different procedure.","1.

The case states that the breaches revealed personal data related to their clients; at the very least, the attacker was able to confirm that the credentials were correct, and there was a high risk that they also had access to personal information in the accounts (such as their full name, contact information and address). This is in line with the policy's requirement to report data breaches that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
7. The case states that the covered entity (Carrefour S.A.) claimed to have communicated with its clients following the third breach, however, the e-mail only informed the client of a change in their password, and did not specify that there was a data breach. This is not in compliance with the policy's requirement to communicate data breaches to the data subjects without undue delay.
8. The case states that the covered entity (Carrefour S.A.) did not comply with the policy's requirement to report data breaches without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it.

"The controller is Yliopiston Apteekki (University Pharmacy), the largest pharmacy operator in Finland. The controller operates the largest online pharmacy in the county, from where individuals can order prescription and over-the-counter medicines. The controller uses third-party tracking services on its website.

A whistleblower notified the DPA that the controller transmits pharmaceutical data from its online pharmacy, such as browsing data or data indicating the intention to purchase a particular medicine, to Meta, Google and New Relic (a performance monitoring service). These companies received precise information about medicine purchases, data that could be linked to an individual customer.

In June 2022 the DPA initiated investigation on the matter.

The controller claimed that no information about the medicines purchased by the customers or the names of the medicines have been transmitted to Meta, Google or New Relic and that is not possible to draw any conclusions from the pages viewed as to what products the customer has purchased, let alone any further conclusions about the health or medical condition of the person.

"SOLOCAL MARKETING SERVICES (formerly known as PAGES JAUNES MARKETING SERVICES, referred to as the controller) is an advertising company that offers companies to carry out direct marketing campaigns on their behalf (by SMS or e-mail). The controller also transfers the data to the companies in order for them to carry out the direct marketing themselves. To do this, the controller purchases data subjects’ data from data brokers, who collect this data through websites’ entry forms for game contests or online product testing. According to the DPA’s findings, the forms are misleading as they make it significantly easier to consent to having their data being used for direct marketing than not.

The DPA carried out on site investigation in 2022, and informed the controller of its findings in July 2024. The controller argued that it should not be held liable for the way in which its partners collect consent, and that its contractual measures were sufficient to fulfill its obligations. The controller also argued that it could have not foreseen the DPA’s investigation because at the time of the investigation the DPA had not published recommendations specific to consent in the direct marketing sector.","1.

"Following media reports about online tracking, the DPA started several ex officio investigations over the use of tracking tools on websites. Among others, the DPA investigated www.nhi.no, a website providing information about medical topics. The website included many subpages providing information on specific health conditions. The website was published by the company Norsk Helseinformatikk AS (the controller).

The investigation found that the website presented visitors with a cookie banner provided by the cookie management platform Cookiebot. The banner offered visitors three options: “Only necessary cookies”, “Customize”, and “Allow all cookies”. The “Only necessary cookies” button was somewhat visible but featured less prominent colors than the others.

The investigation found that the website implemented the Meta pixel. The Meta pixel is not a cookie and is not stored client-side. The pixel tracked information about actions taken by the user on the website and shared it with Meta. In addition, the pixel stored a tracking cookie (-fbp) on the users’ browser.

The website implemented the pixel on both the home page and subpages, which made it possible to track an individual user’s journey through the website. The website forwarded other information to Meta, including IP addresses, fingerprints for the user’s device, and the unique identifier from the _fbp cookie.
