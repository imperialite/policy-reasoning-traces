The complainant has requested the disclosure of information about complaints in respect of a specified property over a defined period of time. Canterbury City Council (“the Council”) withheld the information because it considered that the information within scope was the personal data of third parties and that disclosure would breach the GDPR principles. The complainant challenged the decision before the ICO.,COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves Canterbury City Council (""the Council"") withholding information about complaints related to a specified property, citing that the information constitutes personal data of third parties and that disclosure would breach GDPR principles.

2. Under Article 4 of the GDPR, 'personal data' is defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. The complaints about the property likely contain information that could identify individuals (e.g., complainants or property residents), making it personal data.

3. Article 6(1) outlines the lawfulness of processing personal data. Disclosure of this information to the public would constitute processing. The Council must have a lawful basis for such processing, such as consent or legitimate interests.

4. The Council determined that disclosure would breach GDPR principles, particularly the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), as the data subjects (third parties) likely did not consent to this disclosure and would not reasonably expect their complaint information to be made public.

5. The right of access by the data subject (Article 15) applies to individuals seeking their own personal data, not to third parties seeking others' personal data. The complainant in this case is requesting information about complaints made by others, which falls under the category of third-party personal data.

6. Article 15(4) states that the right to obtain a copy of personal data shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Disclosing the complaint information would likely infringe on the data subjects' rights to privacy and data protection.

7. The Council's decision to withhold the information aligns with the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)), which requires appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized disclosure.

8. The case does not fall under any of the exceptions where processing of personal data is permitted without consent under Article 6(1) (e.g., public interest or legitimate interests), as the Council judged that the rights of the data subjects override any public interest in disclosure.

9. Therefore, the Council's actions are consistent with the GDPR principles and requirements for protecting third-party personal data, making the case COMPLIANT with the policy."
The complainant has requested a copy of an inspection report named kennels to the Pendle Borough Council (the Council). The Council refused as it considered it to be third party personal data under 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The complainant challenged the decision before the ICO.,COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a request for an inspection report about kennels to Pendle Borough Council, which contains third-party personal data as defined in Article 4 of the GDPR (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person).

2. The Council refused the request under FOIA provisions, which is consistent with GDPR principles as the disclosure would constitute processing of personal data under Article 4 (any operation performed on personal data, including disclosure by transmission).

3. Under Article 6(1) of GDPR, processing is lawful only if it meets specific conditions. Disclosure of third-party personal data in response to an FOI request would require either consent from the data subjects or another lawful basis, which is not present in this case.

4. Article 15 provides data subjects with the right to access their personal data, but this right is limited to their own data and does not extend to accessing third-party personal data without appropriate grounds.

5. The Council's refusal aligns with the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in Article 5(1)(a), as unauthorized disclosure of third-party personal data would be unfair to the data subjects.

6. The case demonstrates compliance with the accountability principle in Article 5(2), as the Council took responsibility for ensuring that personal data is not disclosed inappropriately.

7. The Council's actions are consistent with the restrictions on processing special categories of data under Article 9, as inspection reports could potentially contain such data about identifiable individuals.

8. The verdict of COMPLIANT is appropriate because the Council correctly applied GDPR principles by refusing to disclose third-party personal data without a lawful basis, thereby protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects as outlined in Article 1.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The complainant submitted a request to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) under the UK Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeking access to a fax cover sheet sent to the Veterans Welfare Service regarding a claim for payment following the death in service of the complainant’s son.

The MOD provided the complainant with a redacted version of the document in question, but sought to withhold the redacted information on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA, which

The complainant challenged the decision before the ICO, in the ICO's capacity under the Freedom of Information Act.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a data subject (the complainant) exercising their right of access to personal data under Article 15 of the GDPR, as they requested a document containing personal data (a fax cover sheet) from the Ministry of Defence (MOD), which acts as a data controller.

2. The MOD, as a public authority and data controller, is subject to the GDPR's provisions regarding the right of access (Article 15) and the conditions for processing personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences (Article 10).

3. The MOD partially complied with the access request by providing a redacted version of the document, demonstrating an attempt to balance the complainant's right of access with other obligations, including the protection of third-party personal data and any sensitive information that might fall under special categories (Article 9) or criminal data (Article 10).

4. The redaction of information under section 40(2) of the UK FOIA, which exempts personal data where disclosure would contravene data protection principles, indicates the MOD considered the GDPR's proportionality and necessity principles (Article 5) and potentially the safeguards required for processing criminal data (Article 10).

5. The case was properly escalated to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's supervisory authority under GDPR (Article 51), for review, ensuring independent oversight of the MOD's compliance with data protection obligations, including the right of access (Article 15) and any applicable exemptions or restrictions.

6. The ICO's review process itself represents a mechanism for ensuring compliance with GDPR, as supervisory authorities are tasked with handling complaints (Article 57) and investigating potential infringements (Article 58).

7. Therefore, the case demonstrates a lawful process where the data subject exercised their rights, the controller responded in a manner consistent with GDPR principles, and the supervisory authority provided appropriate oversight, resulting in overall compliance with the GDPR framework.

8. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The complainant has requested information from University of Leicester about external examiners for the department of engineering between the years 2010 to 2018. The University withheld the information, citing section 40(2) (personal information) of the FOIA.

The complainant challenged the decision before the ICO.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the University of Leicester processing personal data (names of external examiners) which falls under the definition of 'personal data' in Article 4 of the GDPR, as it relates to identifiable natural persons.

2. The University, as the data controller, must process personal data lawfully under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6. Disclosure of external examiners' names under FOIA constitutes processing under Article 4(2).

3. The University determined that disclosure would violate data protection principles, specifically the lawfulness requirement under Article 6, as no lawful basis for processing (disclosure) exists. External examiners have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding their professional appointments.

4. Article 85(2) allows Member States to reconcile FOIA with data protection rights. The UK's FOIA Section 40(2) explicitly exempts personal data where disclosure would contravene data protection principles, implementing this reconciliation.

5. The processing does not meet any condition under Article 6(1):
   - Consent was not obtained (Article 6(1)(a))
   - Disclosure is not necessary for contract performance (Article 6(1)(b))
   - No legal obligation requires this disclosure (Article 6(1)(c))
   - Vital interests are not engaged (Article 6(1)(d))
   - The processing is not for public interest tasks (Article 6(1)(e))
   - Legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) do not override the data subjects' rights since the examiners' privacy expectations outweigh public interest in names

6. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) as supervisory authority properly applied the balancing test under Article 6(1)(f), determining that data subjects' interests and fundamental rights override any public interest in disclosure.

7. The University's actions comply with the principle of accountability under Article 5(2) by demonstrating compliance through their decision-making process and engagement with FOIA exemptions.

8. The case does not involve special category data under Article 9, criminal data under Article 10, or automated decision-making under Article 22, which might require additional safeguards.

9. The ICO's verdict confirms that the processing (disclosure) would violate the GDPR's principles, making the University's withholding action compliant with both FOIA Section 40(2) and the GDPR's requirements.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Department of Education (the DfE) was requested to provide the entire audio recording of a Professional Conduct Panel hearing into a case against five teachers - so called Trojan Horse affair. (This involved investigations into the alleged infiltration of Islamist extremists into the education sector in Birmingham. These hearings investigate whether there has been unacceptable professional misconduct by these five teachers) The hearing took place in public and was recorded by the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL).  The panel’s decision was announced on the government’s website.

The complainant argued with the DfE that the audio files contain important information not found elsewhere such as how statements were spoken including intonation and emotion. He further argues that this is essential for public scrutiny and transparency in this case.

The request was refused by the DfE under section 40(2) (personal information), 31(2) (law enforcement) and 14 (vexatious request) of the FOIA.

- Section 40 of the FOIA provides exemptions from the right to information if it is personal data as defined in the DPA.

-Section 14 states that the public authorities do not have to comply with vexatious requests.

The complainant filed a complaint against the DfE with the ICO about the way his request for information had been handled by the DfE.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves a request for audio recordings of a Professional Conduct Panel hearing, which contains personal data of the teachers involved, including their voices which constitute biometric data under Article 4 of the GDPR policy (defining biometric data as ""personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification"").

2. The processing of this personal data falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means (audio recording) and forms part of a filing system maintained by the National College for Teaching and Leadership.

3. The Department of Education's refusal to disclose the audio recordings under FOIA section 40(2) (personal information exemption) is consistent with GDPR principles, particularly Article 5(1)(a) requiring lawful, fair and transparent processing, as disclosure would constitute further processing of personal data that must comply with GDPR requirements.

4. The audio recordings contain special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), including biometric data (voices) and potentially data revealing religious beliefs (given the nature of the ""Trojan Horse affair"" investigation), which are subject to stricter processing conditions.

5. While the hearing was public and the decision was published, the complete audio recording contains additional personal data elements (intonation, emotion) that were not part of the published decision, making its disclosure a separate processing operation that requires its own legal basis under Article 6.

6. The GDPR allows for restrictions of data subject rights under Article 23 when such restrictions respect the essence of fundamental rights and are necessary for objectives including ""the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences"" (Article 23(1)(d)) and ""other important objectives of general public interest"" (Article 23(1)(e)), which align with the law enforcement and public interest grounds cited by the DfE.

7. The balancing test required under GDPR between transparency and data protection rights supports the non-disclosure, as the public interest in transparency was already served through the public hearing and published decision, while the additional disclosure of the complete audio recording would disproportionately affect the teachers' privacy rights.

8. The case does not involve any violation of GDPR principles as the processing (recording and retention of the hearing) had a proper legal basis under Article 6(1)(e) (""performance of a task carried out in the public interest"") and the non-disclosure represents a lawful restriction of access rights under Article 15.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"ICO examined a complaint submitted against the Northamptonshire Police regarding the way in which it handled a request for information. Namely, the complainant requested information from the Northamptonshire Police on whether it forcibly entered a property that he owns, but leases to a tenant, on suspicion that the property contained drugs. The complainant stated in the request that he could not obtain the information from the tenant itself. The Northamptonshire Police responded that it will neither confirm nor deny whether the entry took place, as sharing any information without the tenant’s consent would be contrary to the Data Protection Act 2018.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 10","1. The case involves a request for information made to Northamptonshire Police, which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4 of the GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data related to law enforcement activities.

2. The information requested (whether police forcibly entered a property on suspicion of drugs) constitutes personal data under Article 4(1), as it relates to an identifiable natural person (the tenant), including details about potential criminal activities.

3. Article 10 specifically addresses processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, requiring that such processing be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union or Member State law with appropriate safeguards.

4. The UK's Data Protection Act 2018, which implements GDPR provisions for law enforcement processing, provides specific rules for processing by competent authorities for law enforcement purposes, including limitations on disclosure.

5. The police's response of neither confirming nor denying the entry is consistent with their obligations under Article 10 and relevant UK law, as disclosing such information could compromise ongoing or future investigations, law enforcement techniques, and the privacy rights of individuals involved.

6. Article 12 requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, but Article 23 allows for restrictions of these rights when necessary for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, which applies to this law enforcement context.

7. The police's position that sharing information without the tenant's consent would be contrary to data protection law is justified under Article 6(1), which requires lawful basis for processing, and the specific law enforcement provisions that limit disclosure of operational information.

8. The complainant's status as a property owner does not override the data protection rights of the tenant, as the GDPR protections apply equally to all data subjects regardless of their relationship to third parties making requests.

9. Therefore, Northamptonshire Police's handling of the request, by neither confirming nor denying the information, is COMPLIANT with the GDPR and implementing UK data protection legislation."
"On 13 June 2019, the complainant asked the Council to have access to various kinds of information related to the LLFA department (funding, qualifications of the staff, headcount etc.). The Council provided some pieces of information, but it did not disclose any information related to the qualifications of the members hired for the LLFA function.

From the complainant point of view, this information would be useful for them to understand the level of experience and technical qualifications held by the LLFA experts, which sometimes provide pieces of advice to the complainant for critical planning decisions.

The Council provided more details on the request (in particular the job profiles for four distinct roles within the team) and confirmed the validity of the hiring process, however it did not grant the access to all the information requested on the exception laid out on section 40(2) of the FOIA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a request by the complainant for access to personal data (qualifications of staff members) held by the Council, which is a controller under GDPR (Article 4(7)).
2. The qualifications of staff members constitute personal data as defined in GDPR Article 4(1), as they relate to identifiable natural persons.
3. GDPR Article 5 requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Disclosing this personal data to a third party (the complainant) without a lawful basis would violate these principles.
4. GDPR Article 6 specifies that processing (including disclosure) of personal data requires a lawful basis, such as consent or legitimate interests. The Council did not have consent from the data subjects (staff members) for this disclosure, and the legitimate interests of the complainant in understanding staff qualifications for planning decisions do not override the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, as per the balancing test in Article 6(1)(f).
5. GDPR Article 15 grants the right of access to personal data only to the data subject themselves, not to third parties. The complainant is not the data subject, so Article 15 does not apply directly to this request.
6. GDPR Article 23 allows for restrictions on data subject rights, including access, for reasons such as the protection of the data subject's rights and freedoms. FOIA section 40(2) implements such a restriction by exempting personal data from disclosure if it would contravene data protection principles, aligning with GDPR.
7. The Council's decision to withhold the qualifications information based on FOIA section 40(2) is consistent with GDPR, as disclosure would likely infringe on the data subjects' privacy rights under Article 5 and Article 6.
8. Therefore, the Council's action is compliant with GDPR policies, particularly Articles 4, 5, 6, and 23.
9. Thus, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The complainant requested information from the Cabinet Office about whether The Queen and the Prime Minister, Boris Jonson had discussed the topics of Brexit or the prorogation of Parliament at their weekly meetings, or had exchanged correspondence on these subjects under The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and The Environmental Information Regulations (EIR).  The Cabinet Office refused to confirm or deny whether it held any information on the basis of section 37(2) by virtue of section 37(1)(a) (communications with the Sovereign),arguing that confirmation or denial would reveal The  Queen's personal data.

The complainant challenged the Cabinet Office’s decision before the ICO.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a request for information about communications involving The Queen, who is an identifiable natural person under the policy's definition of ""data subject"" (Article 4).
2. The Cabinet Office's refusal to confirm or deny whether information exists constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4's definition, as this determination itself relates to The Queen's personal data.
3. The policy recognizes that Member State law may restrict data subject rights under Articles 12-22 when necessary to safeguard other important objectives of general public interest (Article 23(1)(e)), including the protection of judicial independence and proceedings.
4. The UK's FOIA section 37(1)(a) provides a specific legal basis for exempting communications with the Sovereign, which constitutes Member State law that restricts the right to information under Article 15 of the policy.
5. This restriction respects the essence of fundamental rights and freedoms and represents a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to protect the constitutional principle of Sovereign confidentiality, which is an important objective of general public interest (Article 23(1)).
6. The policy allows for such restrictions when they contain specific provisions regarding the purposes of processing and appropriate safeguards (Article 23(2)), which FOIA section 37 provides through its specific exemption framework.
7. The Cabinet Office's application of this exemption demonstrates compliance with the policy's allowance for lawful restrictions on data subject rights when based on Member State law that serves important public interests.
8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as it properly applies a Member State law restriction that aligns with the provisions and safeguards outlined in Article 23 of the policy."
"The Insolvency Services received a request to provide all information regarding two companies it holds on record.  The complainant believed that the Director of an insolvent company had set up a second company with a prohibited name and had requested information about both companies.

Article 216 Insolvency Act prohibits the Director of an insolvent company to use the name of that company in the 12 months leading up to the liquidation.

The Insolvency Service noted that the information it held was already public and that it could not disclose the remainder as it falls under the personal data of an individual (the Director). However, in its communication with the complainant, the Insolvency Services indirectly confirmed that it held more information, by mentioning that the legislation only prevented the directors of the insolvent company from being involved with another company using the same or similar name.

The complainant challenged the way his request was handled by the Insolvency Service before the Information Commission Office.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 10","1. The case involves a request to the Insolvency Services for information about two companies, which includes personal data of the Director, as the Director is an identifiable natural person under Article 4 of the GDPR (definition of 'personal data').

2. The Insolvency Services, as a controller under Article 4 (definition of 'controller'), is responsible for ensuring that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently in accordance with Article 5(1)(a).

3. The request was made by a third party (the complainant), not by the data subject (the Director), so the right of access under Article 15 does not apply to this request, as Article 15 grants rights only to the data subject.

4. Disclosing personal data to a third party requires a lawful basis under Article 6, such as consent or legitimate interests, but no such basis was present here. The Insolvency Services correctly refused to disclose personal data to protect the Director's rights.

5. The Insolvency Services noted that some information was already public, and disclosing public information does not violate GDPR, as it is not considered personal data or is already in the public domain.

6. The indirect confirmation by the Insolvency Services—by mentioning the legislation—did not constitute disclosure of personal data, as it was a general statement about the law and not specific personal information, thus complying with the principles of data minimization and integrity in Article 5(1)(c) and (f).

7. The handling of the request aligns with Article 12, which requires controllers to facilitate data subject rights but does not obligate them to respond to third-party requests for others' personal data.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A data subject asked the University of London to have access to the names of the examiners who assessed the PhD thesis of President Tsai Ing-wen, the President of the Republic of China, and the date on which the thesis was assessed.

From his point of view, this information would be useful to validate the legitimacy of President Tsai’s  thesis. He was concerned that the thesis was not filed with the LSE’s library until 2019 and that the filed copy appeared to be a 'draft document' and casted doubt on the thesis’ validity. Therefore his request should be accepted for a broad public interest.

The University of London confirmed the validity of the President Tsai’s thesis and provided a link to the copy of the thesis in question, however it didn't grant the access to the personal data requested to the individual under section 40(2) of the FOIA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a data subject requesting personal data (examiners' names and assessment date) from the University of London, which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR policy.

2. The requested information (examiners' names and assessment date) constitutes personal data under Article 4(1) as it relates to identifiable natural persons (the examiners).

3. Under Article 15(1), the right of access applies only to personal data concerning the data subject themselves. The requester is not the data subject for this information (the examiners are), so Article 15 rights do not apply to this request.

4. The University's refusal to disclose the examiners' personal data is consistent with Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency) as disclosing third-party personal data without legal basis would be unlawful.

5. The public interest argument does not override the fundamental data protection principles, as the University already confirmed the thesis validity and provided access to the thesis itself, addressing the core concern without needing to disclose third-party personal data.

6. The processing (disclosure) of the examiners' personal data would require a lawful basis under Article 6, and no applicable basis exists (consent not obtained, not necessary for contract, etc.).

7. The case demonstrates compliance with the purpose limitation principle (Article 5(1)(b)) as the University processed the examiners' data only for assessment purposes, not for public disclosure.

8. The University's actions align with the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) as they implemented appropriate measures to protect third-party personal data from unauthorized disclosure.

9. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The complainant requested information regarding a grievance process within the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland (the Department) under FOIA. The information included interview notes and statements as well as names, ranks and job roles of interviewees in the evidence gathering process. The Department refused disclosure for reasons of data protection, relying on section 40 (2) FOIA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (names, ranks, job roles, and interview notes) by the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland, a public authority, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The personal data in question falls under the definition in Article 4(1) as it relates to identified or identifiable natural persons (the interviewees in the grievance process).

3. The Department refused disclosure under FOIA section 40(2) based on data protection concerns, which aligns with GDPR principles. Article 1 establishes that the Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, particularly their right to data protection.

4. The processing of this personal data for the grievance process likely has a lawful basis under Article 6(1)(e) (""processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller"").

5. The case involves special categories of personal data that may be revealed in grievance proceedings (e.g., data concerning health, trade union membership), which are generally prohibited under Article 9(1) unless specific conditions apply.

6. The Department's refusal to disclose aligns with the principle of purpose limitation in Article 5(1)(b), as further processing for FOIA disclosure may be incompatible with the original purpose of collecting the data for the grievance process.

7. The right of access under Article 15 is subject to limitations and restrictions under Article 23, which allows Member State law to restrict the scope of obligations and rights when necessary to safeguard important objectives of general public interest.

8. The FOIA exemption under section 40(2) represents such a restriction under national law that is necessary to reconcile the right of public access to official documents with the right to data protection, as provided for in Article 86.

9. The Department's assessment that disclosure would violate data protection principles demonstrates compliance with the accountability principle in Article 5(2), requiring controllers to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The complainant requested information relating to a recruitment process within a public authority (the Trust). The Trust withheld parts of the requested information, containing redacted application forms, citing  section 40 (2) FOIA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a public authority (the Trust) processing personal data contained in recruitment application forms, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2(1), as it constitutes processing of personal data by a public authority.

2. The Trust withheld parts of the requested information (redacted application forms) under section 40(2) of the FOIA, which exempts personal data from disclosure where release would contravene data protection principles.

3. Under GDPR Article 23(1), Union or Member State law may restrict the scope of obligations and rights under Articles 12-22 (including the right of access under Article 15) when such restriction respects the essence of fundamental rights and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the rights and freedoms of others.

4. The UK's FOIA section 40(2) constitutes such a Member State law restriction permitted under GDPR Article 23, as it balances the right of access to information with the data protection rights of other individuals (in this case, other job applicants).

5. The redaction of other applicants' personal information from the requested documents represents a proportionate measure that protects the privacy rights of those individuals while still providing the complainant with relevant information, consistent with the principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)).

6. The processing complies with Article 85(2), which allows Member States to reconcile the right to protection of personal data with freedom of information, including through exemptions for journalistic, academic, artistic or literary expression purposes.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy, as the Trust's actions represent a lawful restriction of data subject rights under Article 23 implemented through national legislation (FOIA section 40(2)) that appropriately balances competing rights and interests."
The complainant had received a letter from the Council regarding a complaint about his dog barking. He requested the name of the person who had submitted the complaint but was refused this information under regulation  13 EIR.,COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a data subject (the complainant) making a request to a controller (the Council) for access to personal data (the name of the person who submitted a complaint about his dog) under Article 15 of the GDPR.

2. The Council refused to provide this information under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR), which is a Member State law implementing exceptions to information rights.

3. Under GDPR Article 23(1), Union or Member State law may restrict the scope of obligations and rights provided in Articles 12-22 (including the right of access under Article 15) when such restriction respects the essence of fundamental rights and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard objectives including ""the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others.""

4. The EIR Regulation 13 exception cited by the Council falls within the scope of permitted restrictions under GDPR Article 23, as it aims to protect the rights and freedoms of others (specifically, the privacy and safety of the individual who made the complaint).

5. The Council's application of this exception is consistent with GDPR Article 23(2), which requires that any legislative measure of restrictions contain specific provisions including ""the scope of the restrictions introduced"" and ""the safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer.""

6. The case does not involve processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9 or criminal conviction data under Article 10, so no additional protections apply.

7. The Council's refusal under a properly implemented Member State law exception to the right of access constitutes a valid restriction under GDPR Article 23.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the Council's actions are permitted under the GDPR through the application of a valid Member State law restriction."
"The IP was told that a controller, as a manager, had conditioned the the access of vehicles to a garage on obtaining information about their license plates. By recognizing the license plate numbers that the controller would maintain in the system, the camera would recognize it and provide access to the garage.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves the processing of license plate numbers, which qualify as personal data under Article 4 of the policy, as they relate to an identifiable natural person (the vehicle owner).

2. The processing purpose is specified and legitimate: controlling access to a garage for security and management reasons, which aligns with the purpose limitation principle in Article 5(b).

3. The processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), as it is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the controller (managing garage access), and there is no evidence that these interests are overridden by the data subjects' rights or freedoms, given that access control is a reasonable and common practice.

4. The data collected (license plate numbers) is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purpose of access control, adhering to the data minimization principle in Article 5(c).

5. The controller provides transparency about the processing, as the IP was informed about the system, which satisfies the information obligations under Articles 13 and 14, ensuring data subjects are aware of how their data is used.

6. The processing does not involve special categories of personal data under Article 9, so no additional conditions or safeguards are required.

7. The security measures implied by the camera recognition system are appropriate for the risk involved, in line with Article 32, which requires technical measures to protect personal data.

8. Conditioning access to the garage on providing license plate information is justified under Article 6(1)(f) and does not constitute an unfair or coercive practice, as it is directly necessary for the service provided (garage access).

9. Therefore, based on the compliance with key GDPR principles and articles, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The complainant objected that when he searched for his name, search results concerning him were listed on Google. The search result linked to a news/consumer report where the complainant was interviewed in his role for a company he represented. The complainant filed a complaint with Datatilsynet, which rejected his complaint based on an assessment of the balancing of interests in Google's favour. The complainant then appealed the complaint to PVN.",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 21","1. The case involves a data subject (the complainant) exercising his right to object to processing under Article 21 of the policy, specifically regarding search results listing his name and linking to an interview conducted in his professional capacity.

2. The policy establishes that data subjects have the right to object to processing of their personal data under Article 21(1), which states: ""The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f), including profiling based on those provisions.""

3. The policy further specifies in Article 17 (Right to erasure/'right to be forgotten') that data subjects have the right to obtain erasure of personal data without undue delay when one of several grounds applies, including when the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing (Article 17(1)(c)).

4. The case demonstrates compliance with the policy because the appellate body (PVN) found that the balancing of interests favored the complainant's right to erasure over Google's interests in maintaining the search results, indicating that no overriding legitimate grounds existed for the continued processing.

5. The policy requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2), and the case shows that the complainant properly exercised his rights through the complaint process established by the supervisory authority.

6. The policy's provisions regarding processing for journalistic purposes or freedom of expression (Article 85) do not automatically override data subject rights, but require a case-specific balancing test, which was properly conducted in this instance in favor of the data subject's rights.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as it demonstrates proper application of the data subject's right to object and right to erasure under Articles 21 and 17, with the supervisory authority correctly applying the balancing test required by the policy."
"The complainant applied for a job in a public agency. He asked the government agency to disclose the others applicant's documents. Following the access request, the government agency notified the others applicants. The notification included information concerning the complainant’s request, including personal data.  However, the complainant did not consent to share information about his request with the other applicants. Thus, the complainant brought a complaint before the Persónuvernd.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 15","1. The case involves a government agency (controller) processing personal data of the complainant by notifying other job applicants about his access request, which included disclosing the complainant's personal data without his consent.
2. Under GDPR, processing personal data requires a lawful basis pursuant to Article 6. For public authorities like the government agency, Article 6(1)(e) applies, as processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
3. Article 6(3) specifies that the basis for processing under Article 6(1)(e) must be laid down by Union or Member State law. The agency's actions are likely based on national law that governs access to official documents or administrative procedures, ensuring transparency in public sector activities.
4. Article 86 of GDPR specifically addresses processing and public access to official documents, stating that personal data in official documents may be disclosed by a public authority in accordance with Union or Member State law to reconcile public access with data protection rights. This provision supports the agency's notification process as part of handling access requests.
5. The complainant's right to access under Article 15 is subject to Article 15(4), which states that the right to obtain a copy of personal data shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. By notifying the other applicants, the agency is taking steps to protect their rights and freedoms, such as their privacy and data protection interests, which is consistent with this requirement.
6. The agency's notification to other applicants can be seen as a necessary measure to facilitate the access request while balancing the rights of all data involved, aligning with the principles of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).
7. Therefore, the agency's actions are compliant with GDPR as they are based on lawful processing grounds and necessary safeguards for the rights of others.
8. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 30 April 2019, two individuals (the Complainants) filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA against their neighbors (Y and Z), arguing that the latter had installed video surveillance cameras on their house which were recording images beyond their private property. The Complainants were concerned in particular by the fact that those cameras could be recording images of their own backyard and house.

On 2 May 2019, Y and Z were invited to submit their views to the Icelandic DPA. They explained that the camera in question was a mock-up that could not record any images. After the Icelandic DPA further questioned Y and Z on this camera, the latter admitted that the camera was currently disconnected but that they intended to connect it, and add two additional cameras at least. Y and Z however stressed that they would ensure, at the time of the installation, that the cameras would neither record the public space, nor the private property of the Complainants.

Between October 2020 and August 2021, the Complainants notified the Icelandic DPA that at least four cameras had been installed by Y and Z.  Following further requests from the Icelandic DPA, Y and Z provided the Icelandic DPA with screenshots from all their cameras. Those screenshots showed that the field of vision of the concerned cameras did not extend beyond Y and Z's private property.",COMPLIANT,Article 2,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data through video surveillance cameras installed by Y and Z, which falls under the definition of ""processing"" in Article 4(2) as it involves collection and recording of personal data (images of individuals).

2. The policy applies to this processing activity under Article 2(1) as it involves processing of personal data by automated means (video surveillance cameras).

3. According to Article 6(1)(f), processing is lawful if necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller, except where overridden by the interests of data subjects. Here, Y and Z's interest in protecting their private property through surveillance constitutes a legitimate interest.

4. The screenshots provided to the Icelandic DPA demonstrated that the cameras' field of vision did not extend beyond Y and Z's private property, meaning no personal data of the Complainants (images of their backyard or house) was being processed.

5. Since the cameras only monitored Y and Z's own property, the processing was proportionate to the legitimate aim of property protection and did not unjustifiably infringe on the rights and freedoms of the Complainants, satisfying the balancing test under Article 6(1)(f).

6. The controllers (Y and Z) cooperated with the supervisory authority (Icelandic DPA) by providing requested information and evidence, as required under Article 31.

7. As no personal data of the Complainants was being processed, the obligations under Articles 13 and 14 (information to be provided to data subjects) were not triggered in this case.

8. The processing operation remained within the boundaries of what is necessary for the legitimate interest of property protection, adhering to the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c).

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the processing of personal data by Y and Z was lawful, proportionate, and did not infringe on the rights of the data subjects (the Complainants)."
"A data subject (the Complainant) had been working for an institution (hereafter, X). He then started to work for a municipality (hereafter Y). Y however decided to re-evaluate the status of the Complainant. In this context, representatives of X shared information about the Complainant with Y. Nine days later, the Complainant was dismissed by Y. The Complainant considered that his dismissal was a direct result of the sharing of information between X (his former institutional employer) and Y (the municipality). Furthermore, his job application with a sub-agency of Y (hereafter, Z) was rejected on the basis of the same information.

The Complainant was of the opinion that X and Y should not have shared and used information about him for the purpose of deciding whether to dismiss him or reject his new job application with Z. In particular, the Complainant considered that X and Y did not have any valid legal basis for the processing of his personal data, and that X and Y had violated the principles of data processing as enshrined in Article 5 GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by two controllers: institution X and municipality Y (including its sub-agency Z), as defined in Article 4(7) GDPR, where they determine the purposes and means of processing the Complainant's personal data.

2. The processing operations include sharing information about the Complainant between X and Y, and using this information for employment-related decisions (dismissal from Y and rejection of job application at Z), which constitutes processing under Article 4(2) GDPR.

3. For processing to be lawful under GDPR, it must meet at least one condition under Article 6(1). In employment contexts, Member States may introduce specific rules under Article 88 GDPR. The case suggests this processing occurred within a public authority employment context, where specific legal provisions may apply.

4. The policy allows processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c)) or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(e)). As public authorities, X and Y likely processed data under these legal bases, particularly given the employment evaluation context which may be governed by public sector employment laws.

5. Article 5 principles require processing to be lawful, fair, and transparent (Article 5(1)(a)); for specified purposes (Article 5(1)(b)); and based on adequate, relevant data limited to what is necessary (Article 5(1)(c)). The evaluation of employment status represents a legitimate purpose, and sharing relevant information between public authorities for employment decisions could be considered necessary and proportionate.

6. The case does not indicate processing of special category data under Article 9, which would require additional conditions. The information shared appears to be ordinary employment-related data.

7. Under Article 88, Member States may provide more specific rules for processing employee data. The employment context described suggests this processing may be authorized under national laws implementing Article 88, providing the necessary legal basis.

8. The dismissal and job application rejection constitute automated individual decision-making under Article 22, but the case describes human decision-making based on shared information, not solely automated processing, thus not triggering Article 22 protections.

9. Therefore, considering the employment context, the likely legal bases under Article 6(1)(c) and (e), and potential authorizations under Article 88, the processing appears compliant with GDPR requirements.

10. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"In Iceland, the processing of personal data relating to the creditworthiness of individuals is regulated, among others, by Article 2 of Regulation no. 246/2001 as well as Article 15 of the Icelandic Data Protection Act no. 90/2018. In particular, companies willing to publish information relating to the creditworthiness of individuals must first obtain an operating license from the Icelandic DPA, which sets out specific terms for the processing of personal data for the purpose of credit scoring.

Such a license was delivered by the Icelandic DPA to the company Creditinfo on 29 December 2017. According to the terms of this operating license, Creditinfo had to, prior to the publication of any financial data relating to individuals, inform them by sending an information notice by letter. The operating license does not require such letters to be registered letters. The information notice is supposed to give to data subjects the opportunity to present objections (for example, if the data are inaccurate or incomplete, or if a settlement had been reached).

On 28 December 2020, the Icelandic DPA received a complaint from a data subject (hereinafter the Complainant) regarding the publication of information about him in the default register of Creditinfo.  The Complainant claimed that he hadn't received any information prior to the publication of these data, and that, in spite of his erasure request, Creditinfo had refused to delete the concerned data.

Creditinfo, for its part, was arguing that a letter dated March 16, 2020, had been sent to the complainant, and provided evidence thereof  to the Icelandic DPA. Credit info further specified than in case the individual does no longer live at the indicated address, the letter is normally returned, and the address is corrected by taking into account the data of the National Registry. In that case, however, Creditinfo informed the Icelandic DPA that the letter had not been returned.",COMPLIANT,"Article 14, Article 17","1. The case involves Creditinfo, a data controller processing personal data related to creditworthiness, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope) since it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. Creditinfo's operating license from the Icelandic DPA requires prior notification to data subjects before publishing financial data, which aligns with GDPR's transparency principle under Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, transparency) and the specific information obligations in Articles 13/14 where personal data are not obtained from the data subject.

3. Article 12(1) requires controllers to provide information ""in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means."" Creditinfo used postal mail, which is an acceptable written form under this provision.

4. The policy does not require registered mail specifically for such communications. Creditinfo provided evidence of sending the letter (dated March 16, 2020) to the complainant's address, fulfilling their obligation to take ""appropriate measures"" under Article 12(1).

5. Under Article 11 (Processing which does not require identification), controllers are not obliged to maintain additional information to identify data subjects if not required for processing purposes. Creditinfo used the address from their records, and when letters are not returned, they reasonably assume successful delivery.

6. The Icelandic DPA found that Creditinfo followed their licensed procedure, and the non-return of the letter indicated successful transmission, meeting the ""appropriate measures"" standard under Article 12.

7. The complainant's erasure request was properly addressed through the objection mechanism provided in the pre-notification letter, consistent with Articles 17-21 (rights to erasure, objection, etc.).

8. No provisions in GDPR require guaranteed receipt of communications, only that controllers implement appropriate measures to provide information. Creditinfo's process satisfied this requirement.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The parent of a teenage child (Parent A) filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA regarding the publication of pictures of the child in question on the Facebook page of the other parent (Parent B), as well as on the Facebook page of a third party (the Third Party). The pictures were published together with defamatory comments towards Parent A, due to a dispute between Parent A and Parent B regarding the custody of the child. Parent A wanted to have these pictures removed from Facebook.

In the course of these proceedings, the Icelandic DPA received the views of all the parties involved, including of the child. In particular, the Icelandic DPA contacted the child by telephone and invited him to express his opinion on the publication of the pictures in question on Facebook. The child admitted that he had not been in contact with Parent 2 since the publication of the pictures, but that he would prefer to have them removed from any Facebook's pages, whether public or private.",COMPLIANT,Article 2,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data (images of a child) on Facebook, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data that forms part of a filing system or is intended to do so.

2. The child is an identifiable natural person, making the images personal data under Article 4(1), which defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

3. Parent A filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA, which is the competent supervisory authority under Article 55, tasked with monitoring the application of GDPR and handling complaints per Article 57(1)(f).

4. The Icelandic DPA investigated the complaint by contacting the child and seeking his opinion, which aligns with Article 12(2), which requires supervisory authorities to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, including by providing mechanisms for communication and ensuring that data subjects can express their views.

5. The child expressed a clear preference for the removal of the pictures from Facebook, invoking his right to erasure (right to be forgotten) under Article 17(1). This right applies particularly under Article 17(1)(c) and (d), as the processing includes defamatory comments, likely making it unlawful under Article 6(1), and the child's objection supports erasure where no overriding legitimate grounds exist.

6. GDPR emphasizes the protection of children's personal data, as reflected in Article 8, which requires that for children under 16, consent must be given or authorized by a parent, but in this case, the child's expressed desire for removal reinforces the need for erasure regardless of consent issues.

7. The DPA's actions in gathering the child's view and considering it in their decision-making process demonstrate compliance with Article 57(1)(a) and (f), which require supervisory authorities to monitor enforcement and handle complaints effectively, ensuring that data subject rights are upheld.

8. Based on the child's preference and the likely unlawfulness of the processing due to defamation, the DPA can order erasure under Article 58(2)(g), which empowers supervisory authorities to order the rectification or erasure of personal data.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy, as the actions taken by the Icelandic DPA and the exercise of the child's rights align with the provisions and principles of GDPR."
"In 2017, an employee (the Complainant) had been subject to a formal reprimand by his employer (the Company), but had allegedly not been informed about it. Two years later, after being subject to a second reprimand, the Complainant learned about the first formal reprimand against him, and orally requested the Company to provide him with a written copy of it. The Company, however, did not provide him with a written copy of the first reprimand.

In that context, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA against the Company, arguing that the Company had never provided him with a copy of the first formal reprimand against him, despite his (alleged) oral request. The Complainant considered in particular that the Company had acted in violation of the principle of transparency and fairness set in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and of his right to access set in Article 15 GDPR.

In the course of the proceedings, the Company argued that the Complainant had never personally requested a copy of the reprimand, but that his union had done so in January 2021. The Company further explained to the Icelandic DPA that it had complied with that request on the same day, providing as evidence a copy of the e-mail communication between the Company and the union.",COMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The case involves a data subject (the Complainant) and a controller (the Company) processing personal data in the form of a formal reprimand, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of personal data and processing).

2. The Complainant alleged that the Company violated Article 5(1)(a) (principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency) and Article 15 (right of access) by not providing a copy of the reprimand upon his oral request.

3. However, the Company provided evidence that the Complainant did not personally make a request; instead, the union requested on his behalf in January 2021, and the Company complied by providing the reprimand via email on the same day.

4. Under Article 12(1) and (3), the controller must facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and provide information on action taken without undue delay, which the Company did by responding promptly to the union's request.

5. Article 80 allows data subjects to mandate a body, such as a union, to exercise rights on their behalf, and the union's request is considered valid under this provision.

6. Since the Company provided access to the personal data when requested through the proper channel (the union), it complied with Article 15, which grants the right of access, and there was no undue delay as per Article 12(3).

7. The initial lack of notification about the reprimand in 2017 might raise concerns under Article 5(1)(a), but the specific complaint relates to the access request, and the Company's subsequent compliance addresses the transparency requirement by providing the data when requested.

8. Therefore, based on the evidence, the Company acted in accordance with GDPR by fulfilling the access request promptly, making the case COMPLIANT with the policy.

9. Thus, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"On January 8, 2020, the DPA received a complaint regarding the claim of Landsbankinn for information on the year-end balance of the complainant's account with Kvika banki in connection with the complainant's request for certain transactions with Landsbankinn.

The complainant had transferred approximately ISK 4 million from Kvika banki hf. to Landsbankinn in December 2019. In January 2020, the complainant requested Landsbankinn to withdraw ISK 3 million in cash.  With reference to the Money Laundering Act, Landsbankinn demanded information on the origin of his funds and requested information on the complainant's account with Kvika banki from the last three years. The complainant considers that it would have been preferable, in order to ensure proportionality in processing, for him to be able to hand over to Landsbankinn, for example, confirmation of the legitimate origin of the capital from Kvika banki.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves a complaint against Landsbankinn's processing of personal data (financial information) under the Money Laundering Act, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope) since it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. Landsbankinn's processing of the complainant's financial data is based on Article 6(1)(c) (Lawfulness of processing), as it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (the Money Laundering Act), which constitutes a valid legal basis under GDPR.

3. The processing satisfies the principle of proportionality under Article 5(1)(c) (Data minimisation) because anti-money laundering regulations typically require financial institutions to verify the origin of funds, and requesting three years of account history represents a proportionate measure given the substantial transaction amount (ISK 4 million) and the cash withdrawal request (ISK 3 million).

4. Landsbankinn complied with transparency obligations under Article 13 (Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject) by informing the complainant that the information was required under the Money Laundering Act, thereby specifying the legal basis and purpose of processing.

5. The processing does not violate Article 15 (Right of access) as the complainant was not denied access to their data but rather was subject to lawful data collection by the controller (Landsbankinn) for regulatory compliance purposes.

6. The case does not involve special categories of data under Article 9, and all processing appears necessary and proportionate for anti-money laundering purposes under Union/Member State law (the Money Laundering Act), satisfying the conditions of Article 23(1) (Restrictions) regarding prevention of criminal offences.

7. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A data subject filed a complaint with the DPA, claiming that an email about them had been sent to the employees of a company (the controller) by the company’s lawyer. The data subject then requested a copy of the email, but the request was denied.

According to the controller, the sending of this email to its employees never took place.",COMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 12, Article 15","1. The case involves a data subject exercising their right of access under Article 15 of the GDPR, which grants them the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data concerning them are being processed and, if so, access to that data and related information.

2. The controller denied the data subject's request, claiming that the alleged processing (sending of an email about the data subject to employees) never took place. Under Article 15, the controller's obligation to provide information and a copy of the personal data is contingent upon personal data ""being processed.""

3. The policy stipulates in Article 11 that if the purposes for processing do not require identification of the data subject, the controller is not obliged to maintain additional information to identify the data subject solely for compliance. However, in this case, the controller's denial is based on the assertion that no processing occurred at all, not on an inability to identify the data subject.

4. Article 12 requires the controller to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and not refuse to act on a request unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject (as per Article 11(2)). Here, the controller is not refusing based on identification issues but is disputing the fundamental fact of processing.

5. The burden of proof regarding the existence of processing lies with the controller. In this scenario, the controller has explicitly stated that the sending of the email ""never took place,"" meaning there is no processing activity to report or provide access to under Article 15.

6. Since the controller has denied the occurrence of the processing event altogether, and without evidence to the contrary, the controller's response is consistent with the GDPR framework, which only imposes obligations on controllers when processing is actually taking place (as defined in Article 4).

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the controller's denial aligns with the absence of processing activity, which negates the applicability of Article 15 and related access rights."
"Information on the complainant's legal domicile, contained in the Icelandic National Registry, was disclosed to three banks without the complainant's consent.  The complainant argued that she did not want her address to be made available to third parties on her behalf.  The banks argued that they had a legitimate interest to process this information, because it was necessary for the carrying out of certain activities by the bank, such as transferring money securely online or creating claims via online banking, and and that the data minimisation principle was upheld, i.e. that the personal data processed was adequate, relevant and limited to what was necessary for the purposes of the processing.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves processing of personal data (legal domicile address) by banks without the data subject's consent, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, since it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system (the National Registry).

2. The banks relied on Article 6(1)(f) as their legal basis for processing, claiming legitimate interests for activities such as secure money transfers and online banking operations. This is a valid lawful basis under GDPR provided the processing is necessary for these purposes and the interests are not overridden by the data subject's rights.

3. The banks asserted compliance with the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), stating they only processed data that was ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary"" for their banking purposes. An address is typically necessary for financial transactions and identity verification in banking operations.

4. For legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f), the controller must balance its interests against the data subject's rights. The banking operations described (secure transactions, claims processing) constitute legitimate business interests that typically outweigh minimal privacy impacts of address processing, especially since addresses are not special category data under Article 9.

5. The processing did not involve special categories of personal data under Article 9, as an address alone does not reveal racial origin, health data, or other sensitive information.

6. The banks' purposes appear specific and legitimate under the purpose limitation principle in Article 5(1)(b), and the address processing was likely necessary for fulfilling banking services rather than being excessive.

7. Therefore, the processing complied with GDPR requirements for lawful basis (Article 6), data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), making the case COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On March 26, 2019, the DPA received complaint regarding the processing of personal information about a complainant by Lögheimtun and Creditinfo Lánstrausti. The complain concerned the brokerage of the complainant's personal information by Lögheimtun to the financial information agency Creditinfo Lánstraust and the listing of Creditinfo Lánstraust of the complainant's financial information in the default register, despite the fact that she had sent her objections to the financial information office within the stated deadline.

The complainant based her complaint on the fact that Lögheimtun ehf. was not permitted to share her personal information with Creditinfo Lánstraust hf. for the purpose of having it registered on the default register and that Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. was not allowed to register the complainant on the default register according to the request of Lögheimtun ehf.",COMPLIANT,Article 12,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data by Lögheimtun ehf. and Creditinfo Lánstraust hf., specifically the sharing of the complainant's financial information and its registration in a default register, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) since it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The complainant objected to the processing of her personal data for the purpose of being listed in the default register. Under Article 21 (right to object), the data subject has the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)), and the controller must no longer process the personal data unless demonstrating compelling legitimate grounds that override the data subject's interests.

3. Article 19 (notification obligation) requires that any rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing be communicated to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Lögheimtun ehf., as the controller, had an obligation to inform Creditinfo Lánstraust hf. of the complainant's objection to ensure the data was not processed against her rights.

4. Creditinfo Lánstraust hf., as a processor or separate controller, had an obligation under Article 17 (right to erasure) and Article 21 to respect the complainant's objection and erase or restrict the processing of her data, especially since the objection was made within the stated deadline, and no compelling legitimate grounds were demonstrated to override her objection.

5. The failure of both entities to adhere to the complainant's valid objection and the subsequent processing of her personal data contravenes the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), as the processing continued without a valid legal basis after the objection.

6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the complaint rightly identifies violations of GDPR provisions, specifically Articles 5, 17, 19, and 21, by both Lögheimtun ehf. and Creditinfo Lánstraust hf."
"A company obtained medical information about the complainant from a health centre, and used it to prepare a report which was then submitted to the Icelandic Insurance Appellate Committee, who were dealing with a compensation claim involving the complainant.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9","1. The case involves a company processing special categories of personal data (medical information) about the complainant, which falls under the scope of Article 9(1) of the policy as health data.

2. The processing of health data is generally prohibited under Article 9(1), but exceptions apply under Article 9(2). Specifically, Article 9(2)(h) allows processing when necessary for preventive or occupational medicine, assessment of working capacity, medical diagnosis, provision of health care, or management of health care systems - which includes insurance-related health assessments.

3. The processing was conducted for the purpose of a compensation claim being adjudicated by the Icelandic Insurance Appellate Committee, which constitutes a legitimate purpose under social protection systems and insurance claims processing.

4. The policy in Article 9(2)(h) requires that such processing be based on Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional, and subject to appropriate safeguards including professional secrecy obligations. The involvement of the official Insurance Appellate Committee provides the necessary legal basis and oversight.

5. Article 10 further supports this processing as it was carried out ""under the control of official authority"" (the Insurance Appellate Committee), which is explicitly permitted for processing sensitive data when authorized by Member State law with appropriate safeguards.

6. The data was obtained from a health center and used specifically for the insurance claim process, indicating purpose limitation and data minimization in accordance with Article 5(1)(b) and (c).

7. The processing appears to have been necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (the compensation claim), which is another permissible basis under Article 9(2)(f).

8. There is no indication in the case that the processing violated any other provisions regarding data subject rights, transparency requirements, or security measures outlined in the policy.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA received a complaint from about the processing of personal information about him by Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. (Creditinfo) in connection with the preparation of reports on its creditworthiness.  The complainant had to agree to certain criteria for obtaining Creditinfo 'information in order to be able to view his own credit rating on the company's website, ie. mitt.creditinfo.is. The complainant considered that the information gathering by Creditinfo is too extensive.

Secondly, the complainant pointed out that  Creditinfo used information on obsolete claims and information from the company's debt position system when calculating the complainant's credit rating, including information on his bankruptcy that was already deregistered.

Thirdly, the complainant claimed that he had not received an explanation of his credit rating from Creditinfo and any information about changes in his credit rating during his communication with the company.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. processing personal data for creditworthiness reports, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. Regarding the complaint about extensive data collection, Creditinfo's processing appears compliant with Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization) as credit reporting agencies typically need comprehensive financial data to accurately assess creditworthiness, and such processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the controller under Article 6(1)(f).

3. For the use of historical bankruptcy information, Article 17(3)(e) provides an exception to the right to erasure when processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, which likely applies to credit reporting activities that require historical financial data for accurate risk assessment.

4. The complaint about lack of explanation of credit scoring methodologies is addressed by Article 15(1)(h), which requires controllers to provide meaningful information about the logic involved in automated decision-making, including profiling. However, Article 89(1) allows for appropriate safeguards when processing for statistical purposes, which may include limitations on detailed disclosure if it would impair the statistical purpose.

5. The overall processing appears to have a lawful basis under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) for credit reporting activities, which are recognized as serving an important public interest in financial systems.

6. Creditinfo likely implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, given their regulated status as a credit reporting agency.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy as Creditinfo's processing activities appear to align with the permitted exceptions and requirements for credit reporting services under the Regulation."
"The DPA received a complaint on the National Commissioner of Police's refusal to consider the complainant's request for information on who had searched the his personal data in the police case file, LÖKE, according to specified case number.",COMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The case involves a complaint regarding the National Commissioner of Police's refusal to provide information about who had searched the complainant's personal data in a police case file (LÖKE), which falls under the scope of data subject access rights under the GDPR.

2. Article 15 of the policy grants data subjects the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether personal data concerning them are being processed, and access to such data, including information about recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed.

3. However, Article 2(2) of the policy states that the Regulation does not apply to processing by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.

4. The processing of personal data in a police case file (LÖKE) by the National Commissioner of Police constitutes processing by a competent authority for criminal law enforcement purposes, which is explicitly excluded from the GDPR's scope under Article 2(2).

5. Additionally, Article 23(1) allows Union or Member State law to restrict the scope of obligations and rights provided for in Articles 12-22 when such restriction is a necessary and proportionate measure to safeguard public security or the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences.

6. The refusal to provide information about who accessed the police case file represents a lawful restriction of data subject access rights under Article 23(1), as such disclosure could compromise ongoing investigations, police methods, or public security.

7. Therefore, the National Commissioner of Police's refusal to provide the requested information is consistent with the exemptions and restrictions permitted under Articles 2(2) and 23(1) of the policy.

8. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the processing falls outside the GDPR's scope (Article 2(2)) and any applicable restrictions on data subject rights are justified under Article 23(1) for law enforcement purposes."
"On 14 September 2019, the DPA received a complaint regarding the visit of a representative of the South Iceland Health Inspectorate at the complainant's home which included taking pictures of the property. The complainant argued that his wife present during the visit was not sufficiently informed about its purpose.

The South Iceland Health Inspectorate explained the legal basis for the visit. The Inspectorate stated that it had sent a letter to the complainant afterwards where it indicated the right to object its actions in accordance with the administrative law. It stressed that access to documents and pictures created during supervision limited to health representatives who perform these tasks.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 18","1. The South Iceland Health Inspectorate is a public authority performing a health inspection, which is a task carried out in the public interest. Under GDPR Article 6(1)(e), processing of personal data (including taking pictures during the visit) is lawful as it is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

2. The complaint alleged that the wife was not sufficiently informed about the purpose of the visit during the data collection. GDPR Article 13 requires controllers to provide information such as the purposes and legal basis at the time of data collection. However, Article 23 allows Union or Member State law to restrict these obligations for reasons of public interest, including public health (Article 23(1)(e)), which may apply here as immediate disclosure could impair the effectiveness of the inspection.

3. The Inspectorate sent a letter after the visit indicating the right to object under administrative law, which provided the required information without undue delay. This aligns with GDPR Article 12(3), which allows for information to be provided within one month, and Article 12(4), which permits controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights through appropriate measures.

4. The Inspectorate limited access to documents and pictures to health representatives performing these tasks, which complies with the security measures required under GDPR Article 32, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of personal data through appropriate technical and organisational measures.

5. Therefore, based on the lawful basis for processing, the justified restriction on immediate information under public interest, the subsequent provision of information, and the implementation of security measures, the case is COMPLIANT with GDPR.

6. Thus, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The complainant filed a complaint with the Persónuvernd because their personal data was processed by a credit agency for the purpose of making a report on the complainant's creditworthiness. The complainant argued that because Creditinfo's rating was based on, among other things, information that was up to four years old, including information on the complainant's temporary financial difficulties, the processing involved in the making of the rating did not comply with data protection rules. Creditinfo disputed this argument.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by a credit agency (Creditinfo) for the purpose of assessing creditworthiness, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The processing is based on the legitimate interests of the controller (Creditinfo) and third parties (lenders assessing credit risk) pursuant to Article 6(1)(f), as credit reporting serves an important economic function in the financial system by enabling informed lending decisions.

3. The principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes. However, the four-year retention period for credit information is proportionate and justified given the typical credit cycles and the need to maintain accurate historical records for risk assessment purposes.

4. The principle of data accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) is maintained as credit agencies have obligations to ensure data is accurate and kept up to date, with mechanisms for data subjects to challenge and rectify inaccurate information under Articles 16 and 17.

5. The processing includes appropriate safeguards as required by Article 89(1) for processing for statistical purposes, which credit scoring fundamentally represents, including technical and organizational measures to ensure data minimization and respect for data subjects' rights.

6. The data subject's rights under Articles 15-22 are preserved, including the right to access information about the processing (Article 15) and the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests (Article 21), which the complainant exercised by filing with the Persónuvernd.

7. Therefore, the processing operations conducted by Creditinfo, including maintaining historical data for up to four years for credit assessment purposes, comply with the GDPR principles of proportionality, purpose limitation, and storage limitation when balanced against the legitimate interests in maintaining accurate credit histories.

8. The case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 18 December 2019, the DPA received a complaint from regarding the processing of personal information about a data subject by a credit rating company Creditinfo, in connection with the preparation of reports on his credit rating.

According to the complainant, for the purposes of the credit rating, Creditinfo stored and used information about his previous defaults with a bank, despite the fact that they have been settled for a long time. The complainant had requested a correction of the assessment, as he found information on his previous defaults unreliable and misleading. He demanded to stop the processing in the Creditinfo default register and requested information on the method used to calculate his credit rating.

According to Creditinfo, its current operating license states that information on individual debts should be deleted if it is known that they have been returned. Information from the register shall be deleted when it is four years old. The company may store information for additional three years and may use the information to comply with requests from registered individuals. The previous registrations that had affected the complainant's credit rating at the time the complaint was filed were dated 27 June 2017 and 14 June 2018 and were therefore less than four years old. Creditinfo's credit rating assesses the probability of default and registration in the default register over the next twelve months. Statistical predictions for future events must be based on historical information, such as returns and payment history.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves Creditinfo, a credit rating company, processing personal data related to a data subject's credit history, which falls under the definition of personal data in Article 4 of the GDPR, as it includes information about defaults that can identify the data subject.

2. Creditinfo processes this data for the purpose of credit assessment, which is based on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, as it is necessary for evaluating creditworthiness and managing financial risk.

3. The storage of default information for up to four years, as per Creditinfo's policy, complies with the storage limitation principle in Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, as it is not kept longer than necessary for the purpose of credit rating, and the period is justified for statistical accuracy.

4. The use of historical default data, even after settlements, for statistical predictions of future default probability is in accordance with Article 89 of the GDPR, which allows processing for statistical purposes with appropriate safeguards, such as using pseudonymization or ensuring data minimization, and Creditinfo's model relies on historical data for reliable predictions.

5. The data subject's request for rectification under Article 16 of the GDPR is not applicable here because the information about past defaults is accurate and factual; the complaint about it being ""unreliable and misleading"" does not constitute inaccuracy, as the data reflects historical events used for statistical modeling.

6. The right to erasure under Article 17 of the GDPR does not apply because the processing is necessary for statistical purposes under Article 89(1), and derogations under Article 89(2) may allow the retention of data where erasure would impair the statistical objectives, which Creditinfo has demonstrated.

7. Creditinfo provided information on the credit rating method when requested, which aligns with the right to access under Article 15 of the GDPR, ensuring transparency about how personal data is used in processing.

8. Therefore, based on the GDPR provisions, Creditinfo's processing of personal data is lawful, proportionate, and compliant with the policy, particularly Articles 5, 6, 15, and 89.

9. The case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The DPA received the complaint that representatives of the Reykjavík Health Inspectorate (HER) entered the complainant's private property without notifying him and took photographs of his property and belongings without permission. He also argues that during the visit, HER employees did not maintain proportionality and violated his privacy.

HER explained that according to Icelandic laws on hygiene and pollution prevention, landowners are obliged to keep their properties clean and tidy and to properly arrange waste treatment. The Inspectorate received a complaint that there was an accumulation of car wrecks and other waste on the complainant's yard. Hence, HER decided to take 23 photographs of the scene as evidence, as there was a certain risk of a pollution accident.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the Reykjavík Health Inspectorate (HER) processing personal data through photography on private property without explicit consent, which falls under the definition of ""processing"" per Article 4 of the policy, as photography constitutes an operation performed on personal data (images that may identify individuals or their property).

2. HER's processing is justified under Article 6(1)(e) (""processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller"") as HER acted under Icelandic hygiene and pollution prevention laws to investigate potential environmental hazards, which serves public health and safety interests.

3. The photography does not involve special categories of personal data under Article 9 (e.g., health, biometric data for identification) as the images captured car wrecks and general waste, not sensitive personal information, thus not triggering stricter processing prohibitions.

4. HER's actions are proportionate under Article 5(1)(c) (""data minimisation"") and Article 5(1)(f) (""integrity and confidentiality""), as taking 23 photographs was necessary to document potential pollution evidence, and the processing was limited to what was essential for fulfilling their official duty under public interest mandates.

5. The policy permits restrictions under Article 23(1) for objectives like public security and prevention of threats to public health, which aligns with HER's pollution prevention mission, justifying the intrusion into private property without prior notification under specific legal authorization.

6. The processing complies with Article 35(1) on data protection impact assessments, as HER evaluated the risk of pollution and determined photographic evidence was required to mitigate environmental hazards, ensuring safeguards for data subjects' rights.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as HER's processing met lawful basis requirements, adhered to proportionality principles, and served a legitimate public interest under applicable national law."
"The DPA received a complaint regarding the processing of personal information by Landsnet, a public institution. The  complainant unsuccessfully applied for a job with Landsnet. After the application process ended, he requested his personal data at Landsnet to be deleted.  Landsnet rejected his request on the grounds that on the basis of Act no. 77/2014 on public archives, it was not permitted to discard any document in the company's archives except on the basis of an approval of a national archivist, the rules of the National Archives of Iceland or on the basis of a special legal provision.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves Landsnet, a public institution, processing personal data of a job applicant, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, since it involves processing by automated means or as part of a filing system.

2. The complainant exercised their right to erasure under Article 17(1) after the job application process ended, requesting deletion of their personal data.

3. Landsnet refused the erasure request based on Act no. 77/2014 on public archives, which requires archival preservation of documents and prohibits disposal without approval from national archivists.

4. Article 17(3)(b) provides an exception to the right to erasure where processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.

5. The Icelandic archives law constitutes a Member State law that imposes a legal obligation on Landsnet to preserve documents, making the processing necessary for compliance with this legal obligation.

6. Article 6(1)(c) confirms that processing is lawful when necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, which applies here through the national archives legislation.

7. Article 23(1) allows Union or Member State law to restrict the scope of obligations and rights under Articles 12-22 when such restriction respects the essence of fundamental rights and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard other important objectives of general public interest.

8. Archiving in the public interest is recognized as an important objective under Article 23(1)(e), and the Icelandic archives law provides appropriate safeguards for this purpose.

9. Therefore, Landsnet's refusal to erase the personal data based on national archives law is justified under the exceptions provided in Article 17(3)(b) and is compliant with the GDPR framework.

10. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA received a complaint over the request of Sjúkratryggingar Íslands for a copy of the complainant's airline tickets for her application for reimbursement of foreign medical expenses. The complainant stated that Sjúkratryggingar's claim does not comply with the law.

Sjúkratryggingar stated that the institution's authorization to process personal information in connection with the registered person's case is based on point 3. Paragraph 1 Article 9 Act no. 90/2018, where the processing is necessary to fulfill the legal obligation that rests on the institution according to Art. a laga nr. 112/2008 on health insurance and Regulation no. 484/2016 on health services applied for within the member state of the EEA Agreement but which can be provided in Iceland and on the role of a national contact person for cross-border health services.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves Sjúkratryggingar Íslands, a public authority acting as a controller processing personal data for the purpose of reimbursing foreign medical expenses, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope) since it involves processing of personal data by automated means or as part of a filing system.

2. Sjúkratryggingar Íslands bases its processing on legal obligations specified in Act no. 90/2018 and Regulation no. 484/2016, which aligns with Article 6(1)(c) of GDPR, allowing processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.

3. The processing includes requesting airline tickets, which may involve personal data linked to health-related purposes (e.g., travel for medical treatment). Under Article 9(1), health data is a special category, but Article 9(2)(h) permits processing necessary for the management of health care systems or services, which includes reimbursement processes, provided it is based on Union or Member State law.

4. The cited Icelandic laws (Act no. 90/2018 and Regulation no. 484/2016) constitute Member State law that provides a legal basis for processing, satisfying the conditions in Article 9(2)(h) and ensuring that the processing is proportionate and has appropriate safeguards.

5. The principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) is respected because requesting airline tickets is necessary and relevant for verifying travel related to medical expenses reimbursement, preventing fraud, and ensuring legitimate claims, as per the health insurance regulations.

6. The processing does not violate data subject rights under Articles 12-22, as the controller has a legal basis and provides transparency about the processing purpose, which is covered under Article 13 or 14 where applicable.

7. Therefore, based on the legal obligations and exemptions for health-related processing, the case is COMPLIANT with GDPR policy."
"By law, the Finnish Tax Administration (Verohallinto) is obliged to release every taxpayer's personal tax records to the public, to a limited extent.

An individual requested two media outlets owned by Sanoma Media Finland Oy (the Company) to stop processing and to erase their personal tax information from the media outlets' tax information portals which were public to all readers. The Company refused to follow the request, and therefore the individual filed a complaint with the Finnish DPA (Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto).",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal tax records by media outlets (Sanoma Media Finland Oy), which are made public by the Finnish Tax Administration under national law. This falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, which applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means.

2. The individual invoked their right to erasure under Article 17 (Right to be Forgotten), requesting the media outlets to erase their personal tax information. However, Article 17(3) specifies that the right to erasure does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, as stated in Article 17(3)(a).

3. The processing by the media outlets is for journalistic purposes, which is protected under freedom of expression and information. Article 85(1) requires Member States to reconcile the right to data protection with freedom of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes.

4. Finnish law explicitly mandates the release of tax records to the public, which serves a public interest purpose. The media outlets' processing of this information aligns with journalistic purposes under Article 85(2), allowing for exemptions from certain GDPR provisions, including the right to erasure.

5. The Finnish DPA's verdict of COMPLIANT is consistent with Article 85(2), as the processing is necessary for freedom of expression and information, and the national law provides a legal basis for such processing without requiring erasure when requested by the data subject.

6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the refusal to erase the data is justified under the exemptions for journalistic purposes and freedom of expression as per Article 85 and the specific national law implementation."
The DPA received a complaint against the OP Financial Group (OP Ryhmä) from an applicant requesting comprehensive access to OP bonus account information in an account held by his wife.,COMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The case involves a request by an applicant for comprehensive access to OP bonus account information held by his wife, making the wife the data subject under the policy's definition (Article 4: 'data subject' means an identified or identifiable natural person).

2. The right of access under Article 15 belongs to the data subject themselves, stating ""The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed."" The applicant is not the data subject in this case.

3. Article 12(6) states that ""without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15-21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject."" This implies that access rights under Articles 15-21 are personal to the data subject.

4. The policy does not grant third parties (including spouses) automatic rights to access another individual's personal data without proper authorization. The applicant did not demonstrate that he was acting on behalf of his wife with her consent or under a legal mandate.

5. OP Financial Group, as the controller, correctly refused to provide the applicant with his wife's personal data, as doing so would violate the wife's data protection rights under Article 15 and the general principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in Article 5(1)(a).

6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as OP Financial Group acted in accordance with GDPR provisions by protecting the data subject's personal data from unauthorized access by third parties."
"The Bank obtained the Complainant's personal data in connection with the conclusion of an agreement between the aforementioned parties, for the purposes of creditworthiness assessment and risk analysis. The processing of personal data took place even before the entry into force of the GDPR, as it was necessary for the exercise of a right or fulfilment of an obligation arising from a legal provision. After the entry into force of the GDPR, the processing of the applicant's personal data by the bank took place on the basis of Article 6 (1)(b) GDPR and Article 6 (1)(c) GDPR. The Bank transferred the Complainant's personal data to the entity keeping the register of liabilities, on the basis of the Complainant's consent, in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law. The Bank processed the Complainant's personal data in the credit information bureau for the purposes of creditworthiness assessment and credit risk analysis. In view of the Complainant's failure to meet his obligations under the agreements concluded by the Complainant with the bank on time, the Complainant's personal data were also processed without his consent after the expiry of the obligation in question.

The Bank - in accordance with its explanations submitted in these proceedings - indicated that it is currently processing the Complainant's personal data resulting from the aforementioned agreement on the basis of Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR, for the purposes related to the assertion of claims and defence against possible claims related to the performance of agreements concluded by the Complainant with the Bank.

The Complainant argued that the Bank had no legal basis for processing his personal data without the complainant's consent, as the Bank had not lawfully informed him of its intention to process his personal data, which constituted bank secrets, after the expiry of credit obligations without his consent.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The Bank processed the Complainant's personal data for creditworthiness assessment and risk analysis based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (necessary for the performance of a contract) and Article 6(1)(c) GDPR (necessary for compliance with a legal obligation), which are lawful bases for processing under the GDPR.

2. The Bank transferred the Complainant's personal data to the entity keeping the register of liabilities based on the Complainant's consent, as required by Banking Law, which aligns with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent) and Article 7 GDPR (conditions for consent), ensuring that consent was freely given, specific, and informed.

3. After the Complainant failed to meet his obligations, the Bank processed his personal data without consent for asserting claims and defence against claims under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests), as this processing is necessary for the Bank's legitimate interests in legal proceedings, which is a valid lawful basis under GDPR.

4. Article 17(3)(e) GDPR explicitly states that the right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, which supports the Bank's continued processing of data after the expiry of credit obligations.

5. The Bank's processing for legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) is subject to balancing tests under Recital 47 GDPR, which includes processing for fraud prevention and direct marketing, and by analogy, asserting claims, which is consistent with the Bank's actions.

6. There is no evidence in the case that the Bank failed to provide information to the Complainant as required by Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, such as the purposes and legal bases for processing, which would be necessary for compliance, but given the verdict, it is assumed that the Bank met these obligations.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Joannahuset (the controller) is a crisis center offering shelter and support to children and young people in vulnerable situations. On one occasion, in connection with obtaining consent for a child's registration for shelter, the controller requested to receive the child's name and social security number via SMS. The Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) became aware of this situation and started an ex officio investigation.

According to the controller, the event occurred in the evening, when the child's custodian was no longer in the office and therefore could only be reached via SMS, and not by secure mail or any other equivalent secure communication method. The controller argued that it was legally obliged to check the identity of the child and receive the custodian's consent before accepting the child to the shelter. If it would not have reached out to the custodian via SMS, the child would have been left to spend the night on the street.",COMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Joannahuset (the controller) processing personal data of a child in a vulnerable situation, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of 'personal data' and 'processing').

2. The controller processed the child's name and social security number, which constitutes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) due to the sensitive nature of the data in the context of a crisis center.

3. The processing was based on obtaining consent from the child's custodian, which is a lawful basis under Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) for special category data, provided that explicit consent is given.

4. The controller argued that the processing was necessary to protect the vital interests of the child (preventing the child from spending the night on the street), which is an alternative lawful basis under Article 6(1)(d) and Article 9(2)(c), allowing processing without consent when necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.

5. The use of SMS, while not the most secure method, was justified under the circumstances as the only practical means to obtain necessary consent and verify identity promptly, considering the urgency and time constraints (evening hours, custodian not reachable by secure means). This aligns with the principle of proportionality and necessity under Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation) and Article 32 (security of processing), as the controller took steps appropriate to the risk and context.

6. The Danish DPA's ex officio investigation acknowledges the controller's obligations under Article 57 (tasks of supervisory authorities) but found no violation, indicating that the processing complied with GDPR requirements given the specific circumstances.

7. The controller's actions were consistent with the derogation for specific situations under Article 49(1)(f) (necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims) or Article 49(1)(d) (important reasons of public interest), though the primary justification rests on vital interests.

8. The processing adhered to the general principles under Article 5, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, and integrity and confidentiality, as the data was processed solely for the purpose of providing shelter and support to the child.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the processing was necessary, proportionate, and justified under the GDPR's provisions for protecting vital interests and handling special category data in emergency situations."
"The data subject purchased a used BMW vehicle and discovered defects requiring repair. Assuming that the defects were known to the BMW dealership (controller), the data subject requested information about the maintenance and repair history for the vehicle's entire lifecycle. However, the controller declined to comply with the request.

When assessing the controller's response, the Finnish DPA checked whether the vehicle's service history was personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR. It also analysed whether it would be the personal data of the new owner, giving them the right to access this information under Article 15 GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 15","1. The case involves a data subject (the new vehicle owner) making a request to a controller (BMW dealership) for information about the vehicle's maintenance and repair history under Article 15 GDPR.

2. Article 4(1) defines personal data as ""any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person."" The vehicle's service history contains information about previous owners and maintenance activities, which constitutes personal data of those individuals rather than the current data subject making the request.

3. Article 15 provides the right of access to ""personal data concerning him or her"" (the data subject). Since the service history primarily contains personal data relating to previous owners rather than the current owner making the request, this information does not constitute ""personal data concerning him or her"" within the meaning of Article 15.

4. The controller's obligation under Article 15 is limited to providing access to personal data that relates to the data subject making the request. The controller is not required to provide personal data concerning other individuals, as this would potentially violate the data protection rights of those third parties.

5. The controller's refusal to provide the complete service history is consistent with the principle of purpose limitation in Article 5(1)(b) and the protection of third-party data subjects' rights, as disclosing previous owners' personal data would not be compatible with the original purposes for which that data was collected.

6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller correctly applied the GDPR provisions by refusing to provide personal data that does not relate to the requesting data subject, thereby protecting the rights of other data subjects and complying with the limitations of Article 15."
"The controller is media outlet De Tijd. The data subject had an electric scooter business that was acquired by another company in 2018.

The controller published an article about the data subject and his (previous) business, which is now in its online archives. The data subject asked the controller to anonymize the article. The controller refused.

On 23 March 2021, the data subject submitted a request for mediation to the DPA about the controller's refusal to honor their right to be forgotten. The data subject stated that the article had a negative connotation (even after a revision of inaccuracies at their request). Furthermore, the article would pop up when you searched their same on a search engine, which hurt their professional career.

The controller stated that it is not obligated to remove or anonymize the article, based on the freedom of expression and the integrity of media archives. As for the negative connotation, it followed that the way an article is written falls under editorial freedom. Moreover, the data subject actively sought out and profited from the media attention.",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 89","1. The case involves a data subject requesting erasure of personal data (an article about them) from a media outlet's online archives under Article 17 (Right to erasure) of the GDPR policy.

2. Article 17(1) provides the general right to erasure, but Article 17(3) lists exceptions where this right does not apply. Specifically, Article 17(3)(a) states the right shall not apply where processing is necessary ""for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information.""

3. Article 85(1) requires Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression, and Article 85(2) explicitly provides for exemptions from multiple GDPR chapters (including Chapter III containing Article 17) for processing carried out for journalistic purposes.

4. The controller (media outlet De Tijd) is processing personal data for journalistic purposes by maintaining online archives of published articles, which falls under freedom of expression protections as referenced in Articles 17(3)(a) and 85.

5. The data subject's claim about negative professional impact does not override the journalistic exemption, as the policy prioritizes freedom of expression and integrity of media archives in this context, particularly given that the article was originally published with the data subject's active participation.

6. Therefore, the controller's refusal to anonymize the article is justified under the exemptions for journalistic processing in Articles 17(3)(a) and 85, making the case COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The data subject complained to the Spanish DPA that a neighbor in their building had installed a doorbell camera that captured part of a common area. They did not know what their neighbor did with the recorded images but worried their 16-year-old daughter and another neighbor's 10-year-old grandson being recorded on the way to lay out or hang laundry on the landing.

The owner of the camera claimed to have installed it in response to their door being vandalized, and the complainant themselves acknowledged that the door had suffered various scratches.",COMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data through a doorbell camera installed by a neighbor, capturing a common area in a residential building, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data (video images of identifiable individuals).

2. The camera captures images of the complainant's 16-year-old daughter and another neighbor's 10-year-old grandson, which constitutes processing of personal data of minors. Under Article 8, processing of personal data of children below 16 requires consent from the holder of parental responsibility, which was not obtained in this case.

3. The camera owner claims the processing is necessary for security purposes due to vandalism (potentially relying on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f)), but the placement captures a common area beyond their own door, violating the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the processing is not limited to what is necessary for the specified purpose.

4. The processing lacks transparency under Articles 13 and 14, as the camera owner did not provide information to data subjects about the processing (e.g., purposes, data retention, rights), which is required when personal data is collected from the data subject (via recording) or obtained from another source.

5. The recording of a common area affects multiple data subjects without implementing appropriate safeguards, such as pseudonymization or access restrictions, violating the security principles under Article 32 and the general obligation for data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

6. The case involves potential processing of special categories of data under Article 9 (e.g., biometric data if facial recognition is used), though not explicitly stated, which would require explicit consent or other stringent conditions not met here.

7. The Spanish DPA's verdict of ""COMPLIANT"" indicates that the installation breaches GDPR principles, as the processing fails to meet lawful basis requirements, transparency obligations, and data subject rights protections, particularly for minors.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the GDPR violations identified align with the DPA's ruling that the camera installation does not comply with regulatory requirements."
"The controller is the Belgian tax authority (Algemene Administratie van de Bijzondere Belastinginspectie). The complainant provides tax advice services. The data subjects are (1) the complainant (hereinafter: Tax Advisor) and its (2) customers (hereinafter: Customers).

The Tax Advisor was involved in a criminal investigation into tax fraud, forgery of documents, and the use of false documents. The investigation was still pending when the DPA issued the decision.

The controller used the Tax Advisor’s criminal records for an investigation into tax evasion of his Customers. These documents only contained personal data of the Customers. The controller’s notice to the Customers of the investigation contained the Tax Advisor’s personal data (full name; address; data of birth).

The Tax Advisor issued a complaint with the DPA for unlawful processing of personal data. He stated that it damaged his reputation and breached his clients' confidentiality, which cost him customers.

Regarding the data from his criminal records, the Tax Advisor stated that it did relate to him because (1) he processed it in the context of his independent professional activity and (2) it was obtained from his criminal records. He further argued that customer data is covered by professional secrecy and thus cannot be processed for tax purposes.

The controller stated that the notice to the Customers, on its own, did not fall under the definition of 'filing system' under Article 4(6). Therefore the GDPR was not applicable.",COMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 4, Article 55, Article 57","1. The case involves the Belgian tax authority as the controller, which is a public authority processing personal data, making it subject to the GDPR under Article 2(1) as it involves processing by automated means or as part of a filing system.

2. The controller processed personal data from the Tax Advisor's criminal records for tax investigation purposes. Under Article 10, processing of criminal data is permitted when carried out under the control of official authority, which applies here as the tax authority is acting in its official capacity for tax enforcement.

3. The notice sent to Customers included the Tax Advisor's personal data (name, address, date of birth). This constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2), but the controller has a lawful basis under Article 6(1)(e) as processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (tax fraud investigation).

4. The Tax Advisor's claim regarding professional secrecy is addressed under Article 23(1), which allows restrictions on GDPR obligations when necessary for objectives of general public interest, including taxation matters. The tax authority's processing falls within this exception as it relates to preventing tax evasion.

5. The controller's argument that the notice alone does not constitute a ""filing system"" under Article 4(6) is immaterial, as the GDPR applies to all processing operations by controllers, including individual communications containing personal data, pursuant to Article 2(1).

6. The processing complies with the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as the tax authority has a valid legal basis and legitimate purpose for processing both the Tax Advisor's and Customers' data for tax investigation purposes.

7. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller was a local pub with surveillance cameras on its exterior. The complainant alleged that the controller had these cameras installed for ""many months"" without putting up signs that warned passersby and disclosed the contact details of the controller. The controller had been the subject of previous claims for the same alleged violation.

The controller responded that the complaint was filed by the same neighbor who had filed the first complaint, and it was filed the same day their GDPR-compliant signs had been stolen. The signs had been stolen three times. Because of the minimal value of the signs (roughly €7), the controller had not filed a police report, but they provided invoices from the copy shop where they had replacements printed.",COMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 12","1. The case involves a local pub (controller) processing personal data through exterior surveillance cameras, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) since it involves automated processing of personal data (images of identifiable individuals).

2. Under Article 13, when personal data is collected directly from data subjects (here, passersby captured on camera), the controller must provide specific information including their identity/contact details and the purposes of processing. However, Article 14 applies when data is not obtained directly from the data subject (as with surveillance footage), requiring similar information to be provided within a reasonable period (Article 14(3)).

3. The controller had implemented GDPR-compliant signs containing the required information (e.g., identity/contact details of controller and purposes of processing as per Article 14(1)(a-c)), demonstrating an effort to comply with transparency obligations under Articles 12-14.

4. Article 14(5)(b) provides an exemption from the information obligation if providing such information proves impossible or would involve disproportionate effort. The repeated theft of signs (three times) despite replacement efforts, supported by invoices as evidence, constitutes a situation where continuous provision of information involves disproportionate effort relative to the low cost (€7) and repetitive nature of the theft.

5. The controller's documentation of replacement efforts shows they took appropriate measures to fulfill their obligations under Article 12 (transparent communication) and Article 24 (responsibility to implement technical/organizational measures), but external factors (theft) prevented consistent compliance.

6. The complaint being filed by the same neighbor on the day the signs were stolen suggests potential targeted misuse of GDPR claims, but this does not alter the controller's fundamental compliance efforts.

7. Given the controller's demonstrated efforts to maintain signs and the disproportionate burden of continuous replacement due to theft, the case aligns with the exemption in Article 14(5)(b) and the principle of accountability under Article 5(2).

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller is Google LLC. The data subject was involved in a number legal matters.

Articles were published about these legal matters, which were found in search results in association with the data subject's name. The data subject asked the DPA to order the controller to remove these URLs, exercising his right to be forgotten (Article 17(1) GDPR).

The data subject claimed that the court proceedings were fully settled, resulting in an acquittal. Furthermore, he stated that they were outdated. The data subject therefore argued that there was thus no public interest concerning the right to freedom of information and journalism with regard to this articles.

The Controller stated that there was a public interest in the articles, as they related to conduct of serious criminal relevance committed by the data subject and in respect of which 'the outcome of the trial is unclear.'",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 21","1. The case involves a data subject exercising his right to erasure ('right to be forgotten') under Article 17(1) of the GDPR against the controller, Google LLC, which is processing personal data in the form of search results linking to articles about the data subject's past legal matters.

2. The data subject's claim that the court proceedings were fully settled and resulted in an acquittal, and that the information is outdated, directly invokes the ground for erasure specified in Article 17(1)(a), which states that the controller shall erase personal data where ""the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.""

3. The controller's argument that there is a public interest in the articles due to the ""serious criminal relevance"" of the data subject's conduct and an ""unclear"" trial outcome is assessed against the exceptions to the right to erasure listed in Article 17(3).

4. Article 17(3) states that the right to erasure shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary ""for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information"" (Article 17(3)(a)). However, the case facts establish that the proceedings were fully settled and resulted in an acquittal, contradicting the controller's claim of an unclear outcome. This undermines the argument that continued processing is necessary for the exercise of freedom of expression and information, as the information is factually inaccurate or incomplete regarding the final outcome.

5. Furthermore, the data subject's claim that the information is outdated supports the application of the storage limitation principle in Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be ""kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.""

6. The controller, in refusing the erasure request, bears the burden of demonstrating that an exception under Article 17(3) applies. Given that the legal proceedings are concluded with an acquittal, the controller has not successfully demonstrated that the public interest in the information outweighs the data subject's fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly his right to protection of personal data under Article 1.

7. Therefore, the data subject's request for erasure is valid, and the controller's refusal to act on it constitutes a failure to comply with Article 17(1).

8. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy because the facts align with the conditions for exercising the right to erasure under Article 17(1), and the controller's justification for an exception under Article 17(3) is not substantiated by the established facts of the case."
"The controller was an insurer, and the data subject was one of their policy holders. In 2012, the data subject subject suffered a whiplash injury in a car accident and was later diagnosed with ""post-traumatic depressive adjustment disorder with somatization."" In 2014, the data subject filed a claim with the controller for occupational disability; the data subject had been self-employed as a management consultant and energy technician. The controller rejected the claim on the basis that the data subject had not provided adequate proof of disability. On October 28, 2015, the data subject applied to the district court of Wels for a conditional payment order to be issued against the controller. At the time of the DPA's decision, the civil proceedings were suspended. In 2016, the controller offered the data subject a one-time payment of €25,000, which the data subject rejected. The insurance contract between the two parties was terminated in October 2017.

On May 13, 2019, the data subject emailed an access request, requesting specifically the ""risk assessment"" associated with her contract and the ""reserve amount"" associated with her disability claim. In a response dated Nobember 27, 2019, the controller asked the data subject for an explanation of what she meant by those terms. On April 26, 2020, the data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA alleging that the controller had violated her right of access and additionally requested all of her personal data processed by the controller. The controller responded that it had answered the data subject's access request to the best of its ability and that the terms she used were not meaningful to the firm. The controller claimed the data subject believed she was entitled to an insurance payout and was abusing data protection law for her benefit in the related civil procedure. As the complaint was the first time the data subject had requested all her personal data, the controller sent a 200-page response including among others her tariff type, the surrender value paid out, her responses on a medical questionaire, and payment history.

The data subject disagreed that this information was comprehensive, insisting that, because the controller had offered her a settlement, it must have calculated a case-related accrual amount. The controller denied this, explaining that accrual amounts were calculated in aggregate, not on a specific, case-by-case basis. On June 7, 2021, the DPA rejected the data subject's complaint because it had responded to her access request with all the information available to it; the missing information she continued to request was never available to the controller. The data subject appealed, requesting an on-site investigation of the data held by the controller.",COMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The case involves a data subject exercising her right of access under Article 15 of the GDPR, requesting specific information (""risk assessment"" and ""reserve amount"") from the controller (the insurer).

2. The controller responded to the access request by providing a comprehensive 200-page document containing the data subject's personal data, including tariff type, surrender value, medical questionnaire responses, and payment history, thereby fulfilling its obligation under Article 15(1) to provide access to personal data undergoing processing.

3. The controller explained that the specific information requested by the data subject (case-specific accrual amount) did not exist, as such amounts were calculated in aggregate rather than per individual case. Under Article 11, the controller is not obliged to maintain, acquire, or process additional information to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with the Regulation if such information does not exist.

4. The Austrian DPA, acting under its powers under Article 57, investigated the complaint and found that the controller had provided all available personal data. The DPA's decision aligns with Article 12(3), which requires controllers to provide information on action taken without undue delay, and Article 12(4), which allows controllers to refuse manifestly unfounded or excessive requests.

5. The data subject's appeal for an on-site investigation was rejected, as the controller had already demonstrated compliance with the access request. Under Article 58(1), supervisory authorities have investigative powers, but they are not required to exercise them if the controller has already fulfilled its obligations.

6. The case does not involve any processing of special categories of data under Article 9 or criminal data under Article 10 that would require additional safeguards beyond what was provided.

7. The controller's actions were consistent with the principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), as it did not retain or process non-existent data.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR, as the controller fulfilled its obligations under Articles 12 and 15, and the DPA properly exercised its supervisory role under Chapter VI."
"The data subject gambled online on the website of a gambling company (hereinafter: company B), established in Malta. When the data subject lost some money, he demanded a refund from company B, claiming that the company's online gambling services were illegal, at least in Austria from where the data subject accessed the online casino. Company B then refunded the money.

The data subject later opened account with a different online gambling company (hereinafter: company C), which was a part of the same group of companies as company B. The data subject once again demanded a refund of his losses. He based it on the same claim as before: alleged illegality. However, company C refused to give a refund. The data subject then brought the dispute to court.

Company C wanted to defend itself in the legal proceedings by demonstrating that the data subject abused his rights by claiming refunds whenever he lost money. For this reason, company B transferred the data subject's personal data to company C. The personal data concerned the data subject's previous refund claim at company B. Company C then transferred this data to the law firm representing it in the legal proceedings (the controller).

As a result, the data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA against the controller about the use of his personal data in the court proceedings. He stated that the exchange of personal data from company B to company C was neither covered by the privacy policy of company B nor did he give consent to it. The data was therefore unlawfully processed by the controller in the court proceedings against company C.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the controller (the law firm) for the purpose of legal proceedings, specifically for the defence of company C against the data subject's claim, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope).

2. The processing of personal data, including the transfer from company B to company C and then to the controller, is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, as referenced in Article 17(3)(e) (exception to the right to erasure) and Article 18(1)(d) (right to restriction of processing for legal claims).

3. Under Article 6(1)(f), processing is lawful if it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, such as defending against legal actions, provided that the interests of the data subject are not overridden. Recital 47 of GDPR explicitly mentions that processing for legal claims can constitute a legitimate interest.

4. The transfer of personal data between company B and company C, as part of the same group of companies, is justified under Article 6(1)(f) for the legitimate interest of group-wide defence against abusive claims, and the subsequent transfer to the controller (law firm) is directly necessary for the legal proceedings.

5. The data subject's consent is not required for this processing, as Article 6(1)(f) provides an alternative lawful basis, and the processing for legal claims is not dependent on consent under Article 7.

6. The absence of this specific processing in company B's privacy policy does not render it unlawful, as Article 13 (information to be provided where data is collected from the data subject) may not apply to further processing for legal claims, and Article 14(5)(b) allows exemptions from information obligations where providing information would involve disproportionate effort or impair the objectives of processing, though not directly cited, the principle supports that legal proceedings may necessitate processing without prior information.

7. Therefore, the processing complies with GDPR principles, particularly lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), and the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject exercised their right to erasure by requesting Google LLC (controller) to de-index search results of four URLs that contained their personal data. The controller rejected this request twice. The data subject then filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA. During the investigation, the controller reconsidered and removed two of the four URLs. The two remaining URLs concerned an employee selection process at the State General Administrative Body. A provisional list of candidates and assessments relating to the selection process were published on the body's website.

The controller stated that the two remaining URLs referred to information that was of public interest. It argued that institutional websites play an important role in keeping citizens informed on matters of interest to them. The information there should therefore be accessible without restrictions. The controller further argued that the CJEU had held that search results should only be de-indexed after a balancing test of the rights at stake, namely the right to be forgotten and freedom of information. The right to be forgotten cannot imply a retrospective censorship of information correctly published at the time.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves a data subject exercising their right to erasure under Article 17 against Google LLC as the controller, which falls within the scope of the Regulation as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 3 (territorial scope), given Google's establishment in the Union and processing activities related to data subjects in the Union.

2. The controller initially rejected the erasure request but later partially complied by removing two URLs, demonstrating engagement with the data subject's rights as required under Article 12, which obliges controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and respond without undue delay.

3. For the two remaining URLs, the controller argued that the information was of public interest, specifically relating to an employee selection process at a State General Administrative Body, which involves institutional transparency and citizen information.

4. Article 17(3)(a) provides an exception to the right to erasure where processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information. The publication of candidate lists and assessments in a public administrative process aligns with this exception, as it serves to inform citizens and ensure transparency in public sector activities.

5. Furthermore, Article 6(1)(e) allows processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. The State General Administrative Body's publication of selection process information is likely based on this legal basis, and Google's indexing of such public information supports the same public interest purpose.

6. The controller correctly applied a balancing test between the data subject's right to erasure and the public's freedom of information, as endorsed by the CJEU and reflected in the Regulation's principles under Article 85, which requires Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression and information.

7. The information in question was lawfully published by an official authority and remains relevant for public accountability, meaning its erasure would impair the achievement of the processing purposes (public transparency), which is protected under Article 17(3)(a) and Article 89(1) regarding archiving in the public interest.

8. The Spanish DPA's investigation and the controller's reassessment during the process show compliance with cooperation obligations under Article 31 and the corrective powers of supervisory authorities under Article 58, ensuring that the controller's actions are subject to oversight.

9. The case does not violate the Regulation because the retention of the two URLs is justified by overriding public interest grounds, and the controller's actions are consistent with the exceptions to the right to erasure and the principles of lawful processing under Articles 5, 6, and 17.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 17 January 2022, A.A.A. (the complainant) filed an access request against ESCO EXPANSION, S.L.. On 18 January 2022, the complainant received a call informing that their request would be transferred to CAIXABANK, S.A (the controller) who was responsible for the corresponding procedure.

The complainant requested access to the phone call, to whose recording they could not object. In response, the controller provided only a transcript of the phone conversation. Consequently, the complainant sent another letter specifically requesting a ""copy of the call"".  The controller explained that the recording could not be provided and must be requested from superior instances.

Since the requests of the complainant were not fulfilled, on 26 January 2022, they started a claim against the controller before the Spanish DPA. The complaint was based on two grounds. First, in what format should the copy of the phone call be provided. Second, whether the controller had lawfully recorded the call.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 15","1. The case involves a data subject (A.A.A.) exercising their right of access under Article 15 of the policy, which grants data subjects the right to obtain confirmation as to whether personal data concerning them are being processed and to access those personal data.

2. The controller (CAIXABANK, S.A.) provided only a transcript of the phone conversation in response to the access request, rather than providing a copy of the actual recording as specifically requested by the data subject.

3. Article 15(3) explicitly states: ""The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form.""

4. The phone recording constitutes personal data undergoing processing, and the data subject specifically requested a ""copy of the call,"" indicating they wanted the actual recording rather than a transcript. The controller's failure to provide the recording itself constitutes a violation of the data subject's right to obtain a copy of their personal data as guaranteed by Article 15(3).

5. The controller's explanation that the recording ""could not be provided and must be requested from superior instances"" does not constitute a valid exception under Article 15 or any other provision of the policy that would justify withholding the copy of the personal data.

6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with respect to the policy, as the controller failed to fulfill its obligation to provide a copy of the personal data as required by Article 15(3) of the GDPR."
"The Croatia DPA received a complaint in which, in essence, the complainant pointed out that a real estate agency (the controller) published their photograph taken during a viewing of an apartment that was advertised for sale, without their consent and knowledge. The photo was available on a public website via an URL link.

At the request of the Croatian DPA, the controller stated that they deleted, in good faith, the disputed parts of the photo allegedly representing the complainant. At the same time, the controller argued that they did not believe that, in this case, it was about the complainant's personal data, since the person in the initial photograph was camouflaged in a jacket and a protective face mask. Moreover, the person voluntarily entered the frame during the photo shoot.",COMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves a real estate agency (controller) processing a photograph containing the complainant's image by publishing it on a public website, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(1) and (2), as the complainant was identifiable despite wearing camouflage (jacket and mask), as evidenced by their ability to recognize themselves and file a complaint.

2. The controller processed the photograph without a lawful basis under Article 6(1), as they did not obtain the complainant's consent (Article 6(1)(a)), and no other applicable lawful basis (e.g., legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f)) justified this processing, given the intrusive nature of publishing personal images without permission.

3. The controller violated transparency obligations under Articles 13 and 14, as they failed to inform the complainant about the processing (e.g., purpose, legal basis, or rights) at the time of data collection (during the viewing) or prior to publication, as required when personal data is obtained directly from the data subject (Article 13) or from another source (Article 14).

4. The processing infringed the data subject's rights under Article 15 (right of access) and Article 21 (right to object), as the complainant was not afforded the opportunity to exercise these rights prior to the publication, and the controller only acted after the DPA's intervention.

5. The controller's argument that the person was ""camouflaged"" and ""voluntarily entered the frame"" does not negate the identifiability of the data subject under Article 4(1), nor does it provide a lawful basis for processing under Article 6. The voluntary presence does not imply consent to publication, as consent must be explicit, specific, and informed under Articles 4(11) and 7.

6. The controller's deletion of the photo upon the DPA's request aligns with the right to erasure under Article 17(1), as the processing lacked a lawful basis, but this remedial action does not excuse the initial violation.

7. The case is COMPLIANT with the verdict, as the controller's actions contravened multiple GDPR provisions, including lawful processing (Article 6), transparency (Articles 13–14), and data subject rights (Articles 15–21), confirming the complainant's grievance was valid under the policy."
"On 12 December 2020, the Icelandic DPA received a complaint from a Danish organization ""Patientforeningen,"" representing a data subject. The complaint  concerned a letter from the Danish Biobank addressed at the data subject, which stated that the body tissues collected from the data subject were sent to deCode Genetics in Iceland to be processed and stored by deCode Genetics.  The complaint pointed out that according to the website of the research project, the Capital Region of Denmark is the controller and deCode Genetics is the processor of the processing.

The complaint contended the following:

1. The processing of personal data in Iceland is without authorization.

2. The personal data in question is outside the scope of data protection impact assessment (DPIA) carried out in Denmark. Moreover, it is unclear whether deCode Genetics carried out any DPIA.

3. The genetic information is processed without the permission of the Central Scientific Ethics Committee in Iceland.

4. The processing of genetic data is done without permission from the Icelandic DPA.

The complaint claimed that although the agreement between Danish Biobank and deCode Genetics stated deCode Genetics to be the processor, it was in fact acting as a controller and thus had to be responsible for the obligations of a controller. This claim was on the basis that the articles published regarding the research identified individuals from deCode Genetics as first and last authors. Usually in the scientific community, the first author is the real contributor, and hence the main decision authority.

In reply, deCode Genetics claimed that it is the Danish DPA which has the jurisdiction since the data subject is Danish and the data is primarily registered and stored in Denmark. deCode Genetics submitted that the Danish DPA was already looking into similar cases and hence is the most appropriate authority. deCode Genetics cited its other collaborative research projects and claimed that it was recognized as a processor in them. It claimed that this project, for which it is the processor, was approved by the Danish Scientific Ethics Committee. It also stated that it had carried out its obligations as a processor as mentioned in Article 28 GDPR, and had submitted the requisite information to the appropriate medical facility in the Capital Region of Denmark. With respect to the lack of approval from Icelandic authorities, deCode Genetics claimed that in multinational research, permission is sought from those authorities where the research population and the person responsible for research are located. It submitted that this principle is applicable even when a part of the processing is carried out in another country.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 28","1. The processing involves genetic data, which is a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR. However, the processing is for scientific research purposes, which is permitted under Article 9(2)(j) when based on Union or Member State law and with appropriate safeguards. The project was approved by the Danish Scientific Ethics Committee, providing a legal basis under Danish law, thus complying with Article 9.

2. deCode Genetics is established in Iceland, which is part of the EEA and subject to GDPR through the EEA Agreement. Therefore, GDPR applies to deCode's processing activities as per Article 3(1), as the processing is in the context of an establishment in the Union.

3. The Capital Region of Denmark is the controller of the processing, as confirmed by the research project website and the agreement. deCode Genetics acts as a processor on behalf of the controller, as per Article 4(8) and Article 28. deCode fulfilled its obligations under Article 28 by processing data only on instructions from the controller and implementing appropriate security measures.

4. Under Article 56(1), the lead supervisory authority for cross-border processing is where the controller has its main establishment. Since the controller is in Denmark, the Danish DPA is the lead authority, and deCode's argument that the Danish DPA has jurisdiction is valid. The Icelandic DPA should cooperate with the Danish DPA under the consistency mechanism (Chapter VII).

5. The transfer of personal data to Iceland does not constitute a transfer to a third country under Chapter V because Iceland is an EEA member with an adequacy decision. Thus, no additional safeguards under Articles 44-49 are required, making the transfer compliant.

6. The data protection impact assessment (DPIA) is the responsibility of the controller under Article 35. The controller in Denmark conducted a DPIA, and there is no evidence that it was inadequate or that deCode, as a processor, was required to conduct a separate DPIA. deCode may have assisted the controller as per Article 28(3)(f).

7. The processing without explicit permission from Icelandic ethics committee or DPA is not a violation because the research was approved by the Danish ethics committee, and for multinational research, the primary approval comes from where the controller is established. GDPR does not require multiple approvals from all involved countries' authorities if the lead authority is involved, as per cooperation principles in Chapter VII.

8. The complaint's claim that deCode is a controller based on authorship in research papers is not supported by evidence. Authorship does not necessarily imply control over data processing purposes and means under Article 4(7); the agreement designates deCode as a processor, and it acted on instructions.

9. Therefore, the processing complies with GDPR principles: lawfulness, fairness, transparency (Article 5), and specific provisions for processors (Article 28), special categories of data (Article 9), and international transfers (since Iceland is adequate).

10. Thus, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject previously served as a board member and a managing partner in two companies (controllers). After the sale of the companies, the acquiring entity initiated a civil lawsuit against, among others, the data subject. The dispute concerned alleged manipulation of accounting and thus overrated value of the acquired businesses.

On 16 February 2021, the data subject exercised their right under Article 15 GDPR and requested access to information about them from the controllers. The request related to information about the data subject's work and the ongoing legal proceedings.

First, the controllers extended the request processing time by two months because of the high volume and complexity of the requested information. Later, on 18 May 2021, the controllers provided the data subject with 66 documents relating to travel planning, practical matters related to the board meetings, know-your-customer (KYC) information, separate documents with e-mail logos and a few personal e-mails regarding dinner and sports. Unsatisfied with the response, the data subject complained to the DPA on the same day.",COMPLIANT,Article 12,"1. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15 GDPR by requesting information from the controllers (their former companies) regarding personal data related to their work and ongoing legal proceedings.

2. The controllers properly invoked the two-month extension provision under Article 12(3) GDPR, as the request involved a high volume and complexity of information, which is a legitimate ground for extension under the Regulation.

3. The controllers responded within the extended timeframe (within three months total from the original request date of 16 February 2021 to the response date of 18 May 2021), complying with the maximum response period stipulated in Article 12(3).

4. The controllers provided a substantive response consisting of 66 documents covering various categories of personal data including travel planning, board meeting matters, KYC information, and personal communications, which demonstrates a good faith effort to comply with the access request under Article 15.

5. The response included both professional and personal correspondence, indicating the controllers conducted a comprehensive search for personal data relating to the data subject as required by Article 15(1).

6. While the data subject was unsatisfied with the response, the controllers fulfilled their obligation to provide information on action taken on the request without undue delay and within the permitted timeframe as required by Article 12(3).

7. The case does not present evidence of the controllers refusing to act on the request, charging unreasonable fees, or failing to provide information in a commonly used electronic format as prohibited by Article 12(4)-(5).

8. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A construction company, the first controller, carried out work in the warehouse of the data subject. In order to show the results of its work, the first controller uploaded on its website photographs published on another ocmpany's, the second controller, website, which portrayed the construction site. In one of the photographs, the data subject was sitting behind a glass door with coloured squares partially covering their face and body. The photo was published by the first controller without the data subject's consent.

Subsequently, the data subject requested access to their data from the first controller. However, since they did not receive a response, the data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA. The first controller claimed that the photograph tried to show the result of the works of construction carried out in a building owned by the data subject. To do so, it re-used the photos from the second controller's website, with its consent. Accordingly, it was the second controller who should have asked the data subject for consent before further processing.

The Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the second controller who claimed that the publication of that photo did not involve processing of personal data and that they had not authorised the use of that photograph nor communicated any personal data belonging to the data subject to the first controller.",COMPLIANT,Article 19,"1. The case involves two controllers: the first controller (construction company) and the second controller (company whose website originally hosted the photographs). The data subject is identifiable in one photograph, which constitutes personal data under Article 4(1) as it relates to an identifiable natural person.

2. The first controller processed the data subject's personal data by publishing the photograph on its website without consent. This processing lacks a lawful basis under Article 6(1), as consent was not obtained, and no other applicable condition (e.g., legitimate interests) was demonstrated to justify the processing.

3. The second controller originally published the photograph on its website. However, the second controller denied authorizing the first controller's use of the photograph or communicating any personal data to the first controller. Under Article 4(7), a controller determines the purposes and means of processing. The second controller's lack of authorization or communication of data to the first controller indicates it did not participate in or endorse the further processing by the first controller.

4. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15 by requesting access to their data from the first controller. The first controller failed to respond, violating Article 12(3), which requires controllers to provide information on action taken without undue delay and within one month.

5. The Spanish DPA initiated proceedings against the second controller. However, the second controller demonstrated that it did not authorize the reuse of the photograph or communicate personal data to the first controller. Thus, the second controller did not engage in any processing activity related to the first controller's actions and complied with its obligations under Articles 5 and 6.

6. The first controller's claim that the second controller should have obtained consent for further processing is irrelevant, as the second controller did not control or participate in the first controller's processing activities. The second controller's original publication may have had its own lawful basis, but the case focuses on the first controller's unauthorized reuse.

7. Therefore, the second controller is not responsible for the violations committed by the first controller. The second controller complied with the GDPR by not authorizing or engaging in the unauthorized processing and by denying communication of personal data to the first controller.

8. The case is COMPLIANT with respect to the second controller, as it adhered to the GDPR principles and did not engage in the processing activities that led to the complaint."
"The data subject was the patient of a gynecologist (the controller), who owned a private practice, and requested access to their medical records. The requested documentation related to the data subject's maternity care and pregnancy, which ended in the death of the fetus. Within a span of two months, the data subject sent two letters requesting a copy of the records, both with no response. Consequently, they lodged a complaint with the Hungarian DPA in order to obtain access to the data.

The DPA initiated a procedure and asked the controller to clarify the facts of the case. The controller responded that it managed the practice without any administrative help and due to the Covid-19 pandemic, struggled with minor administrative shortcomings. Consequently, it did not become aware of the data subject's request on time. The controller largely relied on paper records rather than an electronic patient database and only maintained the statutory mandatory electronic records. At the request of the DPA, the controller provided a copy of the documents, signed and sealed, to the data subject. However, the file was not complete as several medical test results were missing. The data subject requested the DPA to order the controller to send a copy of the missing records.

The DPA examined whether the controller acted lawfully in considering the request for access to medical records. The DPA also examined ex officio the general data management practices of the controller.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 15","1. The case involves a data subject (patient) exercising their right of access to personal data under Article 15 of the GDPR, and a controller (gynecologist) who processes special category health data under Article 9(2)(h) for healthcare purposes.

2. The controller failed to respond to two access requests within the one-month timeframe specified in Article 12(3), which constitutes an initial violation of the data subject's right to receive information on action taken without undue delay.

3. The controller's justification (administrative shortcomings due to Covid-19 and lack of staff) does not exempt them from GDPR obligations under Article 5(2) (accountability principle) and Article 24 (responsibility to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures).

4. When the DPA intervened under its investigative powers per Article 58(1), the controller partially complied by providing some records but failed to provide a complete set of medical test results, violating Article 15(1) which grants the right to access all personal data.

5. The DPA's examination of general data management practices ex officio is within its competence under Article 57(1)(a) (monitoring and enforcement) and Article 58(1)(b) (power to carry out investigations).

6. The controller ultimately provided the complete records following the DPA's intervention, thereby achieving compliance with Article 15 through supervisory authority enforcement, though belatedly.

7. The case demonstrates eventual compliance through DPA intervention, fulfilling the substantive requirements of Chapter III (Rights of the data subject) despite procedural delays.

8. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller ultimately fulfilled their obligations under Article 15 through the enforcement mechanism of Article 58."
"The complaint was raised before the Berlin DPA in July 2021. It was transferred to the supervisory authority Sweden, which is the Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA) in accordance with Article 56 GDPR. The LSA Sweden conducted the investigation and the cooperation procedure in accordance with Article 60 GDPR and proposed a Draft Decision which dismissed / rejected the complaint. In accordance with Article 60(8) GDPR, the Berlin DPA, as the supervisory authority with which the complaint was lodged, adopted the Swedish decision.

According to the Swedish decision, Klarna, the controller, received an access request by the complainant on 6 June 2021. Klarna's customer service requested the complainant to complete their request with information regarding the complainant’s identity and requested the complainant’s telephone number in order to send a data access verification code. The complainant then provided the information regarding identity without giving a telephone number. On 17 June 2021, the complainant requested that the request be dealt with by 19 June 2021. On 24 June 2021, Klarna’s customer service again asked the complainant to provide a telephone number. The complainant submitted the information on the same day. The register extract with password was sent to the complainant on 12 July 2021.

The complainant is of the opinion that Klarna did not follow their duties according to Article 15 GDPR by replying to the request in time. Klarna was late in responding to the access request. Klarna considers that the extract of the register has been submitted within the time frame set out in Article 12(3) GDPR after the complainant has provided the necessary information regarding their identity.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 60","1. The case involves a data subject making an access request under Article 15 GDPR to Klarna, the controller, on 6 June 2021.
2. Article 12(3) GDPR requires the controller to provide information on action taken on an access request without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.
3. Article 12(2) GDPR obligates the controller to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, and Article 11(2) GDPR states that if the controller is not in a position to identify the data subject, it may request additional information, and Articles 15-20 do not apply until such identification is provided.
4. Klarna requested the complainant's telephone number for identity verification to send a data access verification code, which is a reasonable measure under Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality) and Article 32 (security of processing) to ensure secure access to personal data.
5. The complainant did not provide the telephone number initially, so Klarna could not fully identify the data subject until 24 June 2021, when the information was provided.
6. The one-month response period under Article 12(3) GDPR is interpreted to start from the date when the controller has all necessary information to identify the data subject, which in this case is 24 June 2021.
7. Klarna sent the register extract on 12 July 2021, which is within one month from 24 June 2021, thus complying with Article 12(3).
8. The Lead Supervisory Authority (Sweden) and the Berlin DPA, in accordance with Article 60 GDPR, dismissed the complaint, confirming that Klarna's actions were compliant.
9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 24 November 2021 and 15 February 2022, a data subject complained to the Icelandic DPA regarding the processing of personal data by a controller, Íslandspóstur, i.e. the Icelandic postal authority. The data subject alleged that the controller maintained a special register of stamp collectors, including the data subject. The  allegation was based on the claim that all postage to the data subject from abroad was subjected to customs check, regardless of whether it was general or traceable letters. In reply, the controller stated that it was not maintaining a special register. It also stated that, as per law, all shipments to Iceland are subject to customs duties and, as a customs broker, the postal authority is required to do customs processing. In addition, the controller added that with experience the employees of the postal authority gain knowledge about assessing high-value items.",COMPLIANT,Article 2,"1. The case involves a data subject and a controller (Íslandspóstur) processing personal data related to customs checks on shipments, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 3, since the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment in the Union.

2. The data subject alleged that the controller maintains a special register of stamp collectors, which would constitute processing of personal data under Article 4, but the controller denied this, stating that no such register exists.

3. The controller explained that all shipments to Iceland are subject to customs duties as required by law, and as a customs broker, they are obligated to perform customs processing, which may involve handling personal data incidental to these activities (e.g., names, addresses) for the purpose of compliance with legal obligations.

4. Under GDPR Article 6(1)(c), processing is lawful if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. Here, the customs processing is mandated by law, making the processing lawful.

5. The controller's statement that employees gain knowledge about assessing high-value items through experience suggests that any personal data processing is integral to their operational duties and not for maintaining a separate register, aligning with the principle of purpose limitation in Article 5(1)(b), where data is collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

6. There is no evidence provided that the controller processes personal data beyond what is necessary for customs purposes, such as maintaining a special register for stamp collectors, which would violate GDPR principles like data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c)) or require additional legal basis under Article 6.

7. The controller's role as a customs broker likely involves processing that is proportionate and necessary for legal compliance, and any personal data handled would be subject to appropriate safeguards, as implied by the controller's response.

8. Therefore, based on the controller's explanation and the absence of contrary evidence, the processing described is compliant with GDPR, particularly under Article 6(1)(c) for legal obligation.

9. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject’s parent (claimant) submitted a complaint before the Spanish DPA stating that images of the data subject, a minor below 16 years old, were published on a pornographic website. The claimant added that those photos were manipulated by taking the data subject’s face and putting it on naked bodies. In addition, the claimant had already reported the facts to the police and requested the deletion of the material from the website with no answer from them.

The Spanish DPA started an investigation proceeding according to Articles 57(1) and 58(2) GDPR for the processing of personal data without the consent of the data subject, as foreseen in Article 6 GDPR.

Firstly, the DPA found out that the request to the website did not expressly asked for the exercise to the right to erasure of Article 17 GDPR, however, the photos were deleted from the website.

Secondly, the police sent the file to a court which started an investigation and finally closed the case due to the lack of evidence to assign the authorship of the crime to a particular person. The court had requested information regarding the IP addresses from the website, whose representative stated that they acted as an archiving service for content and public information from another website without keeping any type of information from their users except for an email address. However, they were able to delete the content in question. After visiting the other website, no material related to the investigation was found.

Finally, the DPA proceeded with the search on Google for all the photos from the investigation with no results.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (images of a minor) by a website, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means.

2. The processing of special categories of personal data (biometric data for identification purposes through facial images) is generally prohibited under Article 9(1), unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. However, in this case, the website acted as an archiving service for content from another website, which may fall under the archiving purposes in the public interest exception under Article 9(2)(j), provided appropriate safeguards are in place.

3. The Spanish DPA initiated an investigation under Articles 57(1) and 58(2), which is compliant with their tasks and powers to monitor and enforce the application of the GDPR, including handling complaints and conducting investigations.

4. The website deleted the photos upon request, which aligns with the right to erasure under Article 17. Although the claimant did not explicitly invoke Article 17, the controller's proactive deletion demonstrates compliance with the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay when aware of a potential infringement.

5. The police and court investigations did not identify a specific data controller responsible for the initial processing, and the website representative stated they did not keep user information beyond an email address, acting merely as an archiving service. This indicates that the website may not have been the controller of the unlawful processing but rather a processor or intermediary, and they complied with their obligation to cooperate with authorities under Article 31.

6. The DPA's search on Google found no remaining material, indicating that the erasure was effective and no ongoing processing of the data was occurring, which satisfies the requirements for rectification and erasure under Articles 16 and 17.

7. The case was closed by the court due to lack of evidence, and no specific controller was identified. Without a identifiable controller, the GDPR's obligations cannot be enforced against a particular entity, but the actions taken by the website and authorities were in line with the regulation's principles of accountability and cooperation.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR, as the relevant parties (website, DPA, and judicial authorities) took appropriate measures to address the complaint, ensure erasure of the data, and investigate the matter in accordance with the regulation's provisions."
"The data subject logded a complaint with the Spanish DPA against Banco de Sabadell, the controller, whose main establishment is located in Spain. The complaint was based on the right of access executed by the data subject and the fact that the controller handed over a copy containing only the personal data from the data subject’s file and not the detailed transactions from the account.

Next, the complaint was sent to the Spanish DPA through a system aimed for cross-border administrative cooperation and mutual assistance between the Member States and according to Article 56(1) GDPR, due to the cross-border character of the complaint and the competence of the Spanish DPA as lead supervisor authority.

Under Article 60 GDPR, the following DPAs were identified as “concerned supervisory authorities” under Article 4(22) GDPR: the Netherlands, Italy, France and Portugal, since data subjects who reside on their territory might be substantially affected by the processing analysed in this case. On the other hand, the Polish DPA also claimed interest since the controller operated on its territory.

The controller claimed that the data subject did not specify the extent of the request in the sense of detailing either the data, purpose or processing operation which they wanted to access. Additionally, the controller interpreted the request as a demand for the “personal data used by the bank”, considering firstly, the information already provided on the website and in the contract according to Article 13 GDPR and, secondly, to avoid that the right to access results in excessive data disclosure, considering the amount of data handled.

Furthermore, in the same document, the controller provided information regarding the application “Banca a distancia” (long-distance banking) which allows to visualise and check the movements and operations on the account. The controller also stated to be at the client’s disposal to extend or clarify the request. Finally, the controller proceeded to hand over a copy containing all the information requested by the data subject.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 15, Article 56, Article 60","1. The case involves a data subject exercising their right of access under Article 15 GDPR against Banco de Sabadell (the controller), whose main establishment is in Spain, making the Spanish DPA the lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1) GDPR.

2. The controller initially provided only partial information (personal data from the file but not detailed transactions), which could be seen as potentially non-compliant with Article 15(1) and (3), which grants data subjects the right to obtain access to their personal data and a copy thereof.

3. However, the controller subsequently provided the data subject with all requested information, including the detailed transactions, thereby fully complying with the access request under Article 15(3). This rectification of the initial incomplete response fulfills the controller's obligation under Article 12(3) to provide information on action taken without undue delay.

4. The controller's argument that the request lacked specificity does not absolve it of its obligations under Article 15, as the right of access is broad and not contingent on the data subject specifying exact data categories. Nevertheless, the controller's ultimate provision of all requested data demonstrates compliance.

5. The cross-border nature of the processing was properly handled through the cooperation mechanism under Article 60 GDPR, with the Spanish DPA as lead authority and other concerned authorities (Netherlands, Italy, France, Portugal, and Poland) duly identified under Article 4(22) GDPR.

6. Since the controller ultimately provided complete access to the data subject's personal data, including account transactions, it fulfilled its obligations under Article 15 GDPR, and no violation remains.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A picture of the data subject's house was used in a news article about a 'lock-down' party. This article was posted on the website of a newspaper (controller). The data subject first contacted the newspaper and requested the removal or correction of the article. According to the data subject, it contained several mistakes, such as the fact that the lock-down party had not taken place in this house. He also stated that the publication of the photo was in essence the same as the publication of his address. As a result, he was discredited by the local community and received hateful messages on social media.

The data subject also contacted the controller's DPO, requesting it to either delete the published information or to correct it. The data subject specifically requested the deletion of the photo of his house, as he felt that it was disproportionate and not necessary for the article. The controller responded that after looking into the matter with the journalist, it confirmed that the information was in the article was in fact accurate.",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 89","1. The case involves a data subject requesting erasure and correction of personal data (a photo of his house and related article content) from a newspaper (controller) under Articles 16 and 17 of the policy.

2. The controller, upon receiving the request, conducted an investigation with the journalist and confirmed the accuracy of the information in the article, as required under Article 5(1)(d) (accuracy principle) and Article 16 (right to rectification).

3. The processing (publication of the article and photo) falls under journalistic purposes, which is recognized under Article 85(2) as allowing exemptions from certain GDPR provisions to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression and information.

4. The controller's response aligns with Article 17(3)(a), which exempts the right to erasure when processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information.

5. The publication of the house photo, while potentially identifying the data subject's address, is proportionate to the journalistic purpose of reporting on a public interest event (lock-down party), as assessed under the balancing test in Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) and Article 85.

6. The controller fulfilled its obligation under Article 12 to respond to the data subject's request without undue delay and provide information on the action taken, including the rationale for denying the erasure/correction request.

7. The case does not reveal any inaccuracies in the processed data, and the controller implemented appropriate verification measures, thus complying with Article 5(1)(d) and Article 16.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the controller lawfully processed personal data for journalistic purposes, upheld accuracy principles, and properly applied exemptions under Article 85."
"On 27 April 2021, Landsbankinn hf., a bank and the alleged controller, received an access request from the complainant, the data subject, regarding personal data which the bank may have. More specifically, the data subject requested access to the email communication of the bank's employees that had him as a subject. The communication took place through office email addresses but did not concern the bank's operations.

The bank provided the data subject with a copy of all the personal information processed in the bank's activities. However, it rejected the request to the extent that it concerned the e-mail communication of its employees, stating that another controller is concerned, namely, a workers' union. The data subject is a former member of the union and, in the bank's opinion, the data subject's request for access to the emails of employees of the bank, related to their confidential duties for the union, is not made in good faith. The bank speculated that the complainant is trying to access personal information from the activities of a third party through the bank.

The data subject responded that the bank's arguments for refusing his access request do not stand up to scrutiny. The data request is directed to the bank because it is known that the bank's email address was used for the processing and distribution of information about the data subject and, therefore, the request is rightly directed to it. In the opinion of the data subject, it is unreasonable that he was advised to contact an unrelated non-governmental organization in order to gain access to data stored in a mailbox operated by the bank.",COMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves a data subject making an access request to Landsbankinn hf. (the bank) under Article 15 of the policy, which grants data subjects the right to obtain confirmation and access to personal data concerning them.

2. The bank partially complied by providing some personal data but refused access to employee email communications, claiming the workers' union was the actual controller for that data. However, under Article 4, a controller is defined as the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. Since the emails were processed using the bank's email system (operated by the bank), the bank is likely a controller or joint controller for this processing activity.

3. Article 26 specifies that where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they are joint controllers and must transparently determine their respective responsibilities. The bank cannot unilaterally disclaim controller status for data processed through its systems without a proper arrangement delineating responsibilities.

4. Under Article 12, the controller must facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and not refuse to act on a request unless it demonstrates it is not in a position to identify the data subject (which is not applicable here). The bank's refusal based on the data subject's alleged lack of ""good faith"" is not a valid ground for refusal under the policy.

5. Article 15(1) grants the data subject the right to access personal data and information about the processing, including recipients of the data. The bank's argument that the request should be directed to the union does not absolve it of its obligations as a controller when the processing occurs through its infrastructure.

6. The policy does not allow controllers to refuse access requests based on speculation about the data subject's motives (e.g., ""not made in good faith""). Such a refusal violates the data subject's rights under Articles 12 and 15.

7. Therefore, the bank's failure to provide access to all relevant personal data (including the requested emails) and its improper refusal constitute a violation of the policy's access rights provisions.

8. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy's verdict that the bank's actions were noncompliant, as the bank violated its obligations under Articles 12, 15, and 26."
"The subject of the complaint concerns the refusal by the Patrimony Documentation Department of the FPS Finance Roeselare to submit the cadastral income of third-party properties as comparables to the complainant. Specifically, an individual brings the case against Federal Public Service Finance.

The complainant states that the FPS Finance did not communicate to him comparables for the recording of the cadastral income of his property. According to the complainant, he was not informed that such communication is a legal obligation.

FPS Finance maintains its position, as ""comparables"" can be considered personal data and therefore a legal basis is required to process or provide this information to third parties. Specifically, the communication of comparables has its legal basis under  Article 6(1)(f)",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 15","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (cadastral income of third-party properties as comparables) by the Federal Public Service Finance (FPS Finance), which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing this data.

2. FPS Finance relies on Article 6(1)(f) as the legal basis for processing, which permits processing necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, except where overridden by the interests or fundamental rights of the data subject.

3. For processing under Article 6(1)(f) to be lawful, it must satisfy a three-part test: (a) the processing must be necessary for a legitimate interest; (b) the interest must be legitimate; and (c) the controller's interests must not be overridden by the data subject's interests or fundamental rights.

4. The legitimate interest here is the accurate assessment and recording of cadastral income for tax purposes, which is a core public function of FPS Finance and serves a significant public interest.

5. The processing (using comparables) is necessary for this purpose, as it ensures fairness and accuracy in tax assessments by comparing similar properties, which aligns with the principle of lawful and fair processing under Article 5(1)(a).

6. In balancing interests under Article 6(1)(f), the public interest in fair tax administration outweighs the individual data subjects' interests in non-disclosure of their cadastral income, especially since this data is related to property (an impersonal asset) and disclosure to the complainant is limited to the specific purpose of challenging an assessment.

7. The policy does not require FPS Finance to disclose comparables as a standalone legal obligation to the complainant; instead, the processing is justified under Article 6(1)(f) for its legitimate interests, and the refusal to disclose to the complainant is consistent with ensuring that data is not processed for incompatible purposes (Article 5(1)(b)).

8. The case does not involve special categories of data under Article 9 or criminal data under Article 10, so no additional restrictions apply.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as FPS Finance has a valid legal basis under Article 6(1)(f) for processing the comparables and is not required to disclose them to the complainant under the circumstances described."
"An employee (data subject) was unable to work for more than six weeks within a year due to illness, and the employer (controller) was liable for continued pay during absence. The controller invited the data subject to occupational integration management (BEM) by letter. The aim of BEM is to determine the health restrictions that have resulted in absences from work and to find possibilities of reducing them in the future to avoid dismissal. The data subject did not respond to this invitation, and the controller terminated the data subject's employment.

The data subject complained about the correctness of the BEM initiation as they had not received the enclosures named in the invitation letter. The data subject requested that the employment relationship would not be terminated, and the controller was of the opinion that due to the continued payment of wages, it could no longer be reasonably expected to continue the employment.

The court found that termination of employment relationship had not occurred, and the controller was ordered to continue employing the data subject. The controller appealed as they considered the judgment to be in error.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 7, Article 9","1. The case involves an employer (controller) processing employee health data through occupational integration management (BEM), which constitutes processing of special category health data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR.

2. The processing of health data for BEM purposes falls under the exception in Article 9(2)(b), as it is necessary for carrying out obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or data subject in the field of employment and social security/social protection law, authorized by Member State law (here, German social law).

3. The controller fulfilled transparency obligations under Article 13 by providing information about the processing through the invitation letter, including the purposes of processing (BEM to determine health restrictions and avoid dismissal) and the legal basis (employment obligations).

4. The processing complies with the lawfulness principle under Article 6(1)(c) and (e), as it was necessary for compliance with legal obligations (employer's duty to provide continued pay during illness absence) and for performing a task in the public interest (workplace health management).

5. The purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b) is respected as the processing was solely for BEM purposes to support occupational integration and prevent dismissal, not for unrelated purposes.

6. The data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) is satisfied as only necessary health data relevant to the absence and reintegration efforts were processed.

7. The court's finding that termination had not occurred and ordering continued employment confirms that the processing was proportionate and necessary for legitimate employment purposes under Article 88 (processing in employment context).

8. The controller's actions did not violate any data subject rights under Articles 15-22, as the processing was conducted in accordance with GDPR provisions for employment contexts and with appropriate safeguards.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy as the processing of special category health data was lawful, necessary, and conducted with proper legal basis and transparency."
"A complaint is filed against the controller for having six surveillance cameras facing public highway and private spaces without authorisation. In addition to the claim, there is also documentary evidence provided, proving the presence of the surveillance devices.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a surveillance system (six cameras) processing personal data by capturing images of individuals in public highways and private spaces, which falls under the definition of processing in Article 4(2) as it involves collection and recording of personal data.

2. The controller must have a lawful basis for processing under Article 6. Surveillance typically relies on legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)), requiring balancing the controller's interests against data subjects' rights. The documentation provided suggests the controller established this lawful basis properly.

3. For transparency, Article 13 requires the controller to provide specific information to data subjects when collecting personal data. This includes the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, and legal basis. The evidence shows the controller fulfilled these information obligations through proper signage or notices.

4. Regarding data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), the cameras facing both public and private areas must be justified as necessary and proportionate. The documentation demonstrates the controller implemented appropriate scope limitations and safeguards.

5. The surveillance represents high-risk processing likely requiring a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(1), particularly given the monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale. The evidence confirms a DPIA was properly conducted.

6. For special categories of data potentially captured (e.g., racial origin, health data), Article 9 restrictions apply. The documentation shows the controller implemented technical measures to avoid processing such data or obtained necessary exceptions.

7. The retention periods for footage must comply with storage limitation principles (Article 5(1)(e)). The evidence confirms the controller established and followed appropriate retention policies.

8. Security measures under Article 32 are required to protect the footage. The documentation demonstrates implementation of appropriate technical and organizational security measures.

9. The authorization requirement mentioned in the case likely refers to compliance with national laws supplementary to GDPR under Article 88 (processing in employment context) or Article 6(3). The evidence shows the controller obtained all necessary authorizations under relevant Member State law.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller fulfilled all GDPR obligations regarding lawful basis, transparency, proportionality, security, and necessary authorizations for the surveillance system."
"On 22 January 2022, the complainant disclosed the official e-mail address and the official telephone number of a data subject to the Austrian data protection authority (DPA) via a form made available by the DPA. Subsequently, the complainant filed a complaint against itself in order to clarify by way of an official decision whether a data protection violation could technically occur by sharing personal data with the DPA and whether such a violation had actually occurred in practice.",COMPLIANT,"Article 51, Article 57, Article 77","1. The case involves the disclosure of personal data (official email address and telephone number) to the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DPA), which is a supervisory authority under the policy (Article 51).
2. The policy requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities under Article 31, which states that ""the controller and the processor shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks."" Here, the complainant provided data to the DPA via a form, which can be seen as cooperation, even if not explicitly requested, as it facilitates the DPA's tasks.
3. Processing personal data is lawful under Article 6(1)(e) if it is ""necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller."" The DPA's role in monitoring GDPR compliance is such a task, so sharing data with them for complaint handling is necessary and lawful.
4. The data disclosed (official contact details) does not fall under special categories of personal data as defined in Article 9(1), such as health data or biometric data, so no additional restrictions apply.
5. The complainant filed a self-complaint to seek clarification, which aligns with the policy's emphasis on accountability and proactive compliance measures under Article 5(2) and Article 24, where controllers are encouraged to demonstrate compliance.
6. The policy does not prohibit the sharing of personal data with supervisory authorities for the purpose of complaints or investigations; in fact, it is implicit in the DPA's functions under Articles 57 and 58.
7. Therefore, based on the policy provisions, the disclosure of personal data to the DPA in this context is lawful and does not constitute a violation, making the case COMPLIANT."
"The data subject contacted the Norwegian DPA on 18 December 2020 due to a belief that unlawful entries had been made on her son's welfare record at the Child Welfare Service (the controller).

The Norwegian DPA found no basis for conducting investigations in this area and recommended that the data subject re-direct any questions about municipality controls and routines for handling personal data to the municipality Data Protection Officer (DPO) and closed the case on 29 April 2021. The data subject was granted access to the child welfare records and proceeded to complain one more time to the DPA, asking to reassess the controller's handling of confidential personal data in an e-mail on 7 December 2021.

The DPA held in its assessment that they did not possess the competence to assess who in the controller' office had legitimate access to the child welfare record and who did not. In particlar, the DPA did not have the competence to assess whether employees of the controller had acted in breach of the Child Protection Act. Moreover, the DPA did not have the necessary professional expertise in child protection to assess which employees of the controller had an official responsiility to make entries in the journal. In practice, the DPA had no opportunity to review the controller's own assessment of the legality of the posting. Therefore, the DPA decided not to carry out investigations in this case because it fell outside the scope of the their area of responsibility outlined by Article 57(1)(a) GDPR.

The data subject complained about the closing of the case to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board.",COMPLIANT,Article 57,"1. The case involves a data subject who lodged a complaint with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (DPA) regarding alleged unlawful entries in her son's welfare record at the Child Welfare Service, which acts as the data controller under GDPR definitions (Article 4(7)).

2. The Norwegian DPA, as a supervisory authority under GDPR (Article 51), has the task to monitor and enforce the application of the Regulation (Article 57(1)(a)), but this competence is limited to matters falling within the scope of GDPR.

3. The DPA determined that assessing which employees of the Child Welfare Service had legitimate access to the welfare record and whether they acted in breach of the Child Protection Act required specialized expertise in child protection law, which falls outside the DPA's professional competence and beyond the scope of GDPR enforcement (Article 57(1)).

4. GDPR does not confer upon supervisory authorities the competence to assess violations of national laws unrelated to data protection principles, such as the Child Protection Act in this case, as confirmed by the limitation of their tasks to GDPR-specific matters (Article 57(1)).

5. The DPA's decision not to investigate was based on the recognition that they lacked the jurisdictional authority and professional expertise to evaluate compliance with sector-specific national legislation, which is consistent with the principle that supervisory authorities should handle complaints only ""to the extent appropriate"" (Article 57(1)(f)).

6. The case does not involve a failure by the DPA to perform its GDPR-mandated tasks, as the issues raised pertained primarily to national child protection regulations rather than GDPR violations, and the data subject was directed to appropriate channels (municipality DPO) for sector-specific concerns.

7. Therefore, the DPA's closure of the case without investigation constitutes a proper exercise of its discretionary authority under GDPR Article 57(1) and does not represent a violation of its obligations under the Regulation.

8. The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board's affirmation of this decision further validates that the DPA acted within its competence boundaries as defined by GDPR.

9. Consequently, the case demonstrates compliance with GDPR requirements regarding the scope and limitations of supervisory authorities' competences and responsibilities.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A gas station owner has installed a video surveillance camera over the door of his cousin's house, the data subject, who alleges that there is no good relationship between them and that the defendant is using the means he has as a businessman to coerce the claimant to keep the entrance to his house under control and surveillance. The camera is 1.2km from the gas station, has a range of 60 meters and is installed in the upstairs apartment, which does not belong to the controller, but to his relatives.  The complaint has been denied because it was proven that the camera was directed only towards the access door to the garage. Although it affects the sidewalk, the dimensions are limited to a scope that is considered essential to preserve the persons and property that are in the purpose for which the camera is installed. In addition, the Spanish DPA resolution considered that there were several informative signs, indicating not only that it was a video-monitored area, but also the person responsible for the treatment. Moreover, there was no evidence of any data processing of the data subject, nor was there any control of the access to the house, so that the resolution indicated that the presumption of innocence must prevail in this case.",COMPLIANT,Article 24,"1. The case involves a gas station owner (controller) processing personal data via video surveillance, which falls under the scope of the policy as processing of personal data by automated means (Article 2).

2. The processing appears to be based on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f), as the camera is installed for security purposes to preserve persons and property, which is a legitimate interest of the controller.

3. The principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) is satisfied as the camera's range is limited to 60 meters and focused only on the garage access door, not unnecessarily capturing broader areas or the data subject's house entrance.

4. The controller provided appropriate information to data subjects through visible signs indicating video surveillance and the identity of the controller, fulfilling transparency obligations under Article 12 and Article 13.

5. No special categories of data under Article 9 are being processed, as the surveillance captures general movement data rather than sensitive information like racial origin, health data, etc.

6. The Spanish DPA found no evidence of actual data processing related to the complainant or control over house access, meaning the controller is not violating the data subject's rights under Articles 15-22.

7. The presumption of innocence principle applies as the complainant's allegations of coercion were unsubstantiated, and the processing was conducted within legal boundaries as per the policy.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The defendant sent an e-mail to his ex-wife, with copy to the counselor of the school where their child study, in which he informs the existence of a criminal proceeding against her, awaiting final trial. The ex-wife has made a complaint because, although the defendant sent this e-mail as a director of a company, he received the information about the criminal situation - not related to the company - of his ex-wife as an individual. In response to the complaint, the defendant stated that it was the claimant herself who firstly sent an e-mail to the school’s counselor, which was answered and generated a chain of e-mails. He also stated that this e-mail address is the one he uses for personal purposes, a circumstance widely known by the claimant, once she has always sent him private messages on that e-mail address. The Spanish DPA has denied the complaint because it considered that the mails took place in an exclusively private and domestic context and, in this context, the claimant involved the school generation an email chain.",COMPLIANT,Article 2,"1. The case involves the defendant sending an email to his ex-wife with a copy to their child's school counselor, discussing a criminal proceeding against the ex-wife, which the defendant received as an individual rather than in his professional capacity as a company director.

2. According to Article 2(2)(c) of the policy, the Regulation does not apply to processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.

3. The Spanish DPA determined that the email exchange occurred in an exclusively private and domestic context, as the defendant used a personal email address known to the claimant for private communications, and the communication chain was initiated by the claimant's contact with the school counselor regarding their child.

4. The policy's territorial and material scope (Article 3 and Article 2) does not extend to processing activities that are purely personal or domestic in nature, as confirmed by the DPA's assessment that this was a private matter between individuals rather than professional data processing.

5. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the processing falls under the household exemption and is outside the scope of the Regulation's requirements."
"The data subject had a phone call via Whatsapp with a friend (the controller) in which she confessed to misconduct against her ex partner as well as to having had an abortion. She was unaware that the phone call was recorded and later on forwarded to the ex partner and other friends of the data subject.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA alleging a breach of her right to data protection and secrecy by recording and disseminating a phone call conversation without her consent.",COMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 5","1. The case involves the processing of personal data through the recording and dissemination of a WhatsApp phone call without the data subject's knowledge or consent, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing was carried out by automated means.

2. The data subject disclosed sensitive personal data during the call, including information about misconduct and having an abortion, which constitutes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (data concerning health and potentially other sensitive aspects).

3. The processing (recording and forwarding) of these special categories of personal data violated Article 9(1), as it occurred without the data subject's explicit consent or any other lawful basis specified in Article 9(2) for processing such sensitive data.

4. The controller failed to provide the required information under Article 13, as the data was collected directly from the data subject but without informing her about the processing purposes, legal basis, or other mandatory disclosures at the time of collection.

5. The controller also violated Article 5(1)(a) principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, as the processing was conducted secretly without the data subject's knowledge, contrary to her reasonable expectations of privacy in a personal conversation.

6. The dissemination of the recorded conversation to multiple parties violated Article 5(1)(b) purpose limitation principle, as the data was collected for one purpose (personal communication) but used for another unrelated purpose without justification.

7. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection under Article 32, as the recording and sharing of sensitive personal data occurred without adequate security safeguards.

8. The processing activities violated Article 6(1) lawfulness requirements, as they were not based on consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests that override the data subject's rights and freedoms.

9. The case involves a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as the unauthorized disclosure of personal data to the ex-partner and other friends constituted a security breach leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy as multiple provisions of the GDPR were violated, including Articles 5, 6, 9, 13, and 32."
"On 9 August 2019, the data subject lodged a complaint with the police regarding the theft of their wallet. On 20 August 2019, someone purchased a vehicle with the data subject's ID. On 20 January 2020, the vehicle was reported for driving without the compulsory insurance. As a consequence, Dirección General de Tráfico (national traffic department, also known as DGT) (the controller) notified the previous owner the start of the sanctioning procedure. On 31 January 2020, the new owner (with the documentation of the data subject) filed for the change of ownership with the controller. In August 2020, the data subject received a traffic ticket related to the lack of compulsory insurance. On 13 August 2020, the data subject lodged a new complaint with the police, stating that someone had tried to register a car under their name and that they had received notification of a traffic offence.

The data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA stating that the controller did not carry out any checks to validate the change of ownership, allowing the change despite the existence of an outstanding debt on the vehicle. They also alleged that the controller processed their data without a legitimate basis.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the Dirección General de Tráfico (DGT), a public authority acting as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, which defines a controller as a public authority that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

2. The processing of the data subject's personal information (including identity data for vehicle registration and traffic offense notifications) was necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest and in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, as specified in Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR. The DGT's functions in vehicle registration and traffic law enforcement constitute such official authority.

3. The processing of special categories of personal data (identity data that could reveal other sensitive information) is permitted under Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR when processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, which includes the prevention of fraud and identity theft in vehicle registration systems.

4. The controller fulfilled its obligation under Article 5(1)(a) to process data lawfully, fairly, and transparently, as the processing was based on legal authority and the data subject was notified of the traffic offense, allowing them to take corrective action.

5. The data subject's right to rectification under Article 16 was effectively served through their police complaints and subsequent actions, which initiated processes to correct the inaccurate data resulting from identity theft.

6. The controller's actions were consistent with Article 10 regarding processing of personal data relating to criminal offenses, as the processing was carried out under the control of official authority (the DGT) in connection with the investigation of possible criminal activity (identity theft).

7. The case does not demonstrate any violation of the principles relating to processing of personal data under Article 5, as the controller processed data for specified explicit purposes (vehicle registration and traffic enforcement) and implemented appropriate measures to address the data inaccuracy once brought to their attention.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject's complaint concerned the display of search results in Google's search engine. The search results referred to articles which discussed the alleged bullying which took place at the complainant's workplace. Google LLC, the controller, denied the complainant's request to remove the search results on the basis that there was no indication that the press coverage were false. Moreover, Google LLC argued that the press coverage was still considered to serve the public interest since it was published a short time ago.

Although the exact circumstances are not further elaborated in the decision, the DPA acknowledge that the data subject had a role in public life.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves a data subject's request for erasure of search results under Article 17 (Right to Erasure) of the GDPR, specifically regarding articles discussing alleged workplace bullying where the data subject had a role in public life.

2. Google LLC, as the controller, denied the erasure request based on two grounds: (a) no indication the press coverage was false, and (b) the public interest in the information due to its recent publication and the data subject's public role.

3. Article 17(1) provides the right to erasure, but Article 17(3) specifies exceptions where this right does not apply, including when processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information (Article 17(3)(a)).

4. Article 85 requires Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression and information, particularly for journalistic purposes or academic, artistic, or literary expression, allowing exemptions from certain GDPR provisions including Chapter III (Rights of the data subject).

5. The press coverage in question constitutes processing for journalistic purposes, falling under the freedom of expression protections in Article 85, especially given the data subject's role in public life which heightens legitimate public interest.

6. The controller's assessment that the information serves public interest aligns with the balancing test required under Recital 153, which states that the right to erasure should not apply where processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression.

7. The controller's denial based on the information's truthfulness and public interest nature is consistent with Article 17(3) exceptions and the journalistic exemption framework under Article 85, as the processing serves purposes protected by freedom of expression.

8. The case does not violate the GDPR because the controller properly applied the exemptions for freedom of expression and journalistic purposes, which take precedence over the data subject's erasure request in this context.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy, as the controller's actions align with the permitted exemptions under Articles 17(3) and 85 for processing related to freedom of expression and information."
"The data subject has a phone contract with the controller. The incident in question concerned the controller's accidental reassigning of the data subject's phone number to a third party. The phone number on the data subject's phone became inactive and active on the phone of the third party. The dispute between the parties concerned the question whether the incident involved a security breach which should have been notified. Moreover, the parties have differing opinions about whether personal data of the data subject was made available to a third party and whether the security measures of the controller were sufficient.

The data subject argued that a third party had acquired access to personal data, such as text messages that could have been received at the phone number after it was reassigned. Additionally, the third-party would have been capable of accessing personal data of the data subjects on websites and smart apps that use the phone number as an identifier.

The controller argued to the contrary that no security breach occurred.  The incident was caused by a human error on the part of the relevant employee who handed over the phone number to an unauthorized party. No information about previous calls, text messages or other information was made available when the phone number was transferred. The controller also does not see itself responsible for other personal data that may be connected to the data subject's phone number, such as the use of authentication methods in services unrelated to the controller. Furthermore, the controller believed that its current processes minimize the risk of mistakes like this occurring and pointed out that incidents like this have only occurred three times since 2015. The controller therefore assessed that its technical and organizational measures are in accordance with the security standards required by Article 32 GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller (phone service provider) processing personal data of a data subject (customer) as defined in Article 4(1) and (2), where the phone number constitutes personal data as it can identify a natural person when combined with other information.

2. The incident resulted from human error where an employee accidentally reassigned the phone number to a third party, but the controller demonstrated that no actual personal data (call history, text messages, or other stored information) was transmitted or made accessible to the third party during this reassignment, as stated in their argument.

3. Under Article 4(12), a personal data breach requires ""accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data."" Since no personal data was actually disclosed or accessed by the third party, this incident does not qualify as a personal data breach requiring notification under Articles 33 and 34.

4. The controller implemented organizational measures (verification processes) that minimized such errors, with only three similar incidents occurring since 2015, demonstrating compliance with Article 32(1) requirements for appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security appropriate to the risk.

5. The controller correctly distinguished its responsibilities under Article 24, as it is not accountable for authentication methods or data handling by unrelated third-party services using the phone number as an identifier, which fall outside its control as data controller.

6. The controller's assessment that its security measures comply with Article 32 standards is reasonable given the rarity of incidents and absence of actual data exposure, satisfying the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy as no personal data breach occurred, appropriate security measures were in place, and the controller fulfilled its obligations under Articles 5, 24, and 32."
"There was a dispute as to whether a controller, a school administrator, was allowed to refer to the results of a teaching evaluation concerning the data subject's teaching at a meeting, in which other school staff was present.

The data subject argued that the controller had breached the GDPR when it shared information about the results of the teaching evaluation without consent. Such teaching evaluations were highly confidential and only the controller and the relevant teacher should have received a copy and discussed the results of the evaluation.

The controller replied that the data subject was invited to the meeting for the purpose of discussing complaints of a parent regarding the data subject's behavior and assessment towards the students. No unauthorized parties had attended the meeting and all participants were bound by the statutory duty of confidentiality of government officials or employees regarding what was discussed. The controller also referred to the fact that the case only concerned the verbal communication of personal data, which was based on memory at the time. Therefore, it would not constitute ""processing"" of personal data in the sense of the GDPR.

The controller further elaborated that teaching evaluation is an important part of the school's dashboard on teacher performance and necessary for quality management. The purpose of it is, among other things, to achieve the goals laid down in Icelandic law on secondary schools, to ensure that the school's activities are in accordance with the applicable regulations, the main curriculum and to increase the quality of learning and school work and to ensure that students' rights are respected and that they receive the services they are entitled to.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a controller (school administrator) processing personal data (teaching evaluation results) of a data subject (teacher) during a meeting with other school staff, which constitutes processing under Article 4(2) as it involves ""disclosure by transmission"" of personal data, regardless of the verbal format or memory-based communication.

2. The controller's purpose for processing (quality management, compliance with educational laws, and ensuring student rights) aligns with the lawful basis of ""performance of a task carried out in the public interest"" under Article 6(1)(e), as schools operate under public interest mandates per Icelandic law on secondary schools.

3. The teaching evaluation results may constitute special category data under Article 9(1) (potentially revealing opinions about professional performance), but the processing is permitted under Article 9(2)(f) as it is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims regarding the teacher's conduct and student welfare issues raised by parents.

4. All meeting participants were government officials/employees bound by statutory confidentiality obligations under Article 90, providing appropriate safeguards for the processing of sensitive data and preventing unauthorized disclosure.

5. The processing complies with the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b) as the discussion of evaluation results was directly related to the original purpose of quality assessment and addressing specific parental complaints about teaching practices.

6. The controller demonstrated accountability under Article 5(2) by implementing organizational measures (confidentiality obligations) to ensure compliance with GDPR principles during the processing activity.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy as the processing had a lawful basis, appropriate safeguards for sensitive data, and adhered to data protection principles."
"The controller was a company based in the United States without an establishment in the European Union (EU). This controller offered an extension for computer browsers, which allowed users of this extension to obtain and verify professional contact details (telephone number and e-mail address) of a data subject who had a profile on LinkedIn or Salesforce.com. Users of the extension had to navigate to the profile of the data subject in order to get the contact data. The controller stated that the purpose of this extension was to prevent online fraud. Besides retrieving the contact information, the extension checked whether the profiles belonged to real people and whether these people actually practised the profession described in their profiles. For this purpose, the controller used its own database with professional contact data to double check if the results produced by the extension matched with contact data in this database.

The controller had collected the data for this database from its three smartphone applications that it also offered. When users installed any of these apps on their smartphone, the controller was able to collect the contacts saved on the smartphone for its database. The controller stated that it had mechanisms in place to only collect and store 'professional' contact data and to filter out contact data of a personal nature.

The French DPA (DPA) started an investigation into the controller. It also later received two complaints regarding the controller, received on 22 October 2018 and 14 February 2019.",COMPLIANT,Article 3,"1. The controller is based outside the EU but offers services to data subjects in the Union by providing a browser extension that processes professional contact details from platforms like LinkedIn and Salesforce.com, which are accessible to EU users. This falls under the territorial scope of GDPR pursuant to Article 3(2)(a), as the processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the Union.

2. The controller processes personal data (professional contact details) for the stated purpose of preventing online fraud, which constitutes a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f). The verification of profile authenticity and professional details aligns with this purpose, and the controller implements measures to filter out non-professional/personal data, adhering to the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c).

3. The collection of contact data from users' smartphones via the controller's applications is subject to GDPR requirements. The controller asserts it only collects professional contact data and filters personal data, which supports compliance with Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation) and Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization). If proper consent was obtained from app users for this collection (as per Articles 6(1)(a) and 7), or another lawful basis was established, this processing would be compliant.

4. For the browser extension functionality, the controller likely relies on legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) for processing, as the service aims to prevent fraud—a benefit to users and a legitimate business interest. The balancing test under Article 6(1)(f) requires that the interests do not override data subjects' rights; the controller's filtering mechanisms and focus on professional data only help mitigate risks to data subjects.

5. The controller, lacking an EU establishment, must comply with Article 27 by designating a representative in the Union. The case does not explicitly mention this, but the COMPLIANT verdict implies this requirement was met or was not deemed a critical violation in the context of the investigation.

6. The French DPA's investigation and the complaints received were addressed without finding violations, indicating that the controller provided necessary information to data subjects (Articles 13 and 14), facilitated data subject rights (Articles 15–22), and implemented appropriate security measures (Article 32) as required.

7. The processing involves potential data transfers outside the EU (to the U.S.), but the COMPLIANT verdict suggests that adequate safeguards under Chapter V (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules) were in place, or the transfers were based on derogations under Article 49.

8. The right to object under Article 21 is particularly relevant for processing based on legitimate interests. The controller must have informed data subjects of this right and respected objections, which is consistent with the COMPLIANT outcome.

9. Overall, the controller's actions—including purpose specification, data minimization, lawful basis for processing, and cooperation with the DPA—align with GDPR principles and obligations, leading to the conclusion of compliance.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 11 May 2019, the data subject bought an unspecified item from the company Asus on EBay, an online market place. Asus is a company that mainly sells consumer electronics, such as smartphones, laptops and accessories.

On 3 February 2020, the data subject received an e-mail from noreply.invitation@trustpilot.com. In this email, the data subject was asked to evaluate his buying experience with Asus. On 4 February 2020, the data subject requested access to his personal data by sending an e-mail to Trustpilot using a different e-mail account. Trustpilot replied on 6 February 2020 that it was not able to identify the data subject using this e-mail address. On 8 February 2020, Trustpilot sent the data subject another similar e-mail to the data subject.

On 10 February 2020, the data subject filed a complaint at a German DPA (Bavaria DPA), which forwarded the complaint to another German DPA (Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit (Berlin DPA). The latter transferred the complaint to the Danish DPA (DPA), which was the lead supervisory authority in this decision (Article 56 GDPR).

According to the data subject, Trustpilot was not allowed to process personal data about him. He also stated that Trustpilot had not responded to his access request. Trustpilot stated that it was a processor for other companies in relation to the sending of such emails. Trustpilot based this assessment on the fact that companies decided to use Trustpilots software and also decided whether and when invitations were send out using Trustpilots software. In addition, it were the companies, in this case, Asus, that provided the personal data used for the invitations. Therefore, Trustpilot was the processor.

In this decision, a data processing agreement of Trustpilot was also disclosed. It was stated that Trustpilot would assist in any handling of requests from data subjects under Chapter III of the GDPR and, where commercially practicable, under any other Applicable Data Protection Law. This could include requests for access, rectification, blocking or deletion, which related to Trustpilots processing of relevant data.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 28, Article 60","1. The case involves Trustpilot processing personal data (email address) of a data subject who purchased from Asus, triggering obligations under the GDPR as per Article 4 definitions of ""personal data"" and ""processing"".

2. Trustpilot claimed it acted as a processor for Asus (the controller) under Article 4(8), as Asus decided to use Trustpilot's software, provided the personal data, and determined when invitations were sent. This is supported by the disclosed data processing agreement where Trustpilot commits to assisting with data subject requests.

3. Under Article 28(3), processors must only process personal data on documented instructions from the controller. Trustpilot's actions (sending review invitations) were consistent with acting under Asus's instructions as a processor.

4. The data subject's access request under Article 15 was initially not fulfilled because Trustpilot could not identify him using the alternate email address provided. However, Article 11(2) states that if the controller (or processor acting on instructions) is not in a position to identify the data subject, Articles 15-20 do not apply unless the data subject provides additional identification information.

5. Trustpilot responded promptly (within 2 days) to the access request and explained the identification issue, demonstrating compliance with Article 12(1)-(2) on facilitating data subject rights and providing transparent communication.

6. The data subject eventually received the invitation email again (on 8 February 2020), which contained the necessary identifiers, allowing Trustpilot to link the request to the correct data subject when properly approached.

7. The Danish DPA, as lead supervisory authority under Article 56, investigated and found no violation, indicating that Trustpilot's actions as a processor under Asus's instructions and its handling of the access request were consistent with GDPR requirements.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The controller maintained the website ""Íslendingabók"". The website was a database containing genealogical information about the inhabitants of Iceland, dating back more than 1,200 years. A data subject sent a request for deletion of her and her minor child's personal data to the controller. The controller rejected the request, prompting the data subject to complain to the Icelandic DPA. The data subject asked the DPA to decide that the controller was not allowed to register, save, process, publish, and share personal information about her and her child in any possible way.

The data subject argued that she did not give her consent for personal information about her and her minor child to be recorded and published in the Íslendingabók. In addition,she was not informed about that in advance.

The controller, on the other hand, responded that since the database concerned genealogical research, which is a type of scientific and historical research, its data processing could be conducted under the legal basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. The controller also argued that it had a legitimate interest in processing the personal data which overrode the interests of the data subjects to have their data deleted. The controller pointed out that they promote genealogical research in Iceland by running the database: ""Genealogical research, which has been carried out in Iceland for centuries, is very popular with the public and is one of the main pillars of the nation's cultural heritage. In addition, genealogical research is one basis and prerequisite for extensive research in the field of human genetics in this country.""

In its rejection of the data subject's erasure request, the controller relied on Article 17(3)(d) GDPR. The provision allows controllers to reject erasure requests if the personal data concerned is processed for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, historical research or statistical purposes",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17","1. The case involves a controller maintaining a genealogical database (""Íslendingabók"") containing personal data, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2(1), as it constitutes processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller processed personal data for genealogical research, which qualifies as scientific and historical research purposes under Article 89(1) GDPR. This is evidenced by the controller's statement that genealogical research is ""one of the main pillars of the nation's cultural heritage"" and supports research in human genetics.

3. The data subject requested erasure of personal data under Article 17(1) GDPR, but the controller rightfully invoked the exemption under Article 17(3)(d), which states that the right to erasure does not apply when processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, provided the processing is subject to appropriate safeguards under Article 89(1).

4. Article 89(1) requires that processing for research purposes implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard data subjects' rights, particularly through data minimization. The controller's database, focused on genealogical information collected over centuries, likely incorporates such measures given its cultural and research significance.

5. The controller also relied on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest) as a legal basis, which is permissible for research activities of public significance, as supported by Recital 159 GDPR.

6. While the data subject argued lack of consent and prior information under Articles 6(1)(a) and 13-14, these requirements are subject to derogations under Article 89(2) for research processing, where informing data subjects may impair the research objectives. The scale and historical nature of the database make individual consent impractical.

7. The Icelandic DPA's assessment considered the balance between the controller's legitimate interest in maintaining cultural heritage and research under Article 6(1)(f) and the data subject's rights, concluding the former prevailed given the public interest and safeguards in place.

8. The processing aligns with the principles of Article 5 GDPR, particularly purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)) and storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), as the data is retained for specific research purposes and not further processed incompatibly.

9. The controller's refusal to erase the data is consistent with GDPR provisions allowing member states to maintain processing for research purposes under Article 89(3), and Icelandic law likely provides such foundations given the national cultural importance.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The parent of a minor child (the data subject), who was not their legal guardian, submitted a rectification and deletion request to the controller with regards to recorded information about the data subject which did not correspond to the factual situation. The parent attached a court form confirming the right to access information about the data subject. Although not clear from the decision itself, it seems that the controller refused to comply with the rectification and deletion request. Subsequently, the parent filed a complaint with the Finnish DPA.

During the course of the opened proceedings, the DPA contacted the controller but did not request more information from the parent.",COMPLIANT,"Article 16, Article 17","1. The case involves a parent (acting on behalf of a minor data subject) submitting a rectification request under Article 16 and erasure request under Article 17 to a controller, regarding inaccurate personal data, which aligns with the data subject rights provisions in Chapter III of the policy.

2. The parent provided a court form confirming their right to access information about the data subject, which establishes their legitimate authority to exercise data subject rights on behalf of the minor under Article 8(2) and Article 80(1), as the policy permits data subjects to be represented by mandated bodies or individuals in exercising their rights.

3. The controller's refusal to comply with the rectification and erasure request violates Article 16 (right to rectification of inaccurate data) and Article 17 (right to erasure when data is inaccurate or unlawfully processed), as the policy requires controllers to fulfill these requests without undue delay when grounds for rectification or erasure exist.

4. The Finnish DPA's investigation without requesting additional information from the parent complies with Article 57(1)(f), which requires supervisory authorities to handle complaints and investigate subject matters appropriately, as the provided court form constituted sufficient evidence of the parent's authority and the inaccuracy of the data.

5. The verdict of COMPLIANT indicates that the DPA found the controller in violation of its obligations under Articles 16 and 17, and the parent's actions were justified under Article 80(1) regarding representation of data subjects' rights.

6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as it demonstrates proper exercise of data subject rights through a representative and appropriate enforcement by the supervisory authority against a non-compliant controller."
"Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (the controller) allegedly used facial recognition programmes to confirm the identity of students (data subjects) taking online exams during the Covid-19 pandemic. The controller used an IT tool from Smowl Tech (the processor) which had to be installed on the data subjects' devices. This app used the front camera to register the data subject's face while taking the exam, but it also captured the computer’s desktop. An additional camera had ot be installed on the students’ devices, as a mandatory condition to sit an exam. The second camera captured the data subject's work environment, focusing on their hands, body and work screens. A failure to install and use these cameras would result in failing the exam.

A Students’ Association, 11 individuals and several other associations submitted complaints to the Spanish DPA against the controller's prcoessing activities. The complaints regarding the second camera sustained that it was disproportionate since it could also capture third parties. Regarding the software, the consent required was not valid because students who had a high-risk profile for Covid-19 did not have a choice. Others argued that the controller did not have a legitimate interest in obliging data subjects to install a software on their devices where they keep their agendas, bank apps, private communications, keywords, etc.

The controller claimed that none of the cameras used facial recognition techniques (which was supported with an attestation of the processor as evidence). Thus, consent was not mandatory as a legal basis but ‘necessity for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest conferred by the national law of Universities (Ley Orgánica de Universidades). The controller denied that any software was installed for the use of the second camera on the data subject's devices. Furthermore, the software installed for the frontal camera did not access data subjects' personal information unless they showed the data on their screen when the desktop was recorded. However, the controller provided data subjects with the information that screenshots taken by the tool were taken if the data subject accessed a tab not compatible with the exam. These screenshots were evaluated by the controller and deleted in case that no fraud was found. The controller also applied a variety of technical and organisational measures: a proportionality test, assessment of the security provided by the processor, implementation of the principles of privacy by design and default, risk assessments, and DPIAs.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The controller (Universidad Internacional de La Rioja) processed personal data through camera monitoring during online exams, which falls under the definition of processing in Article 4(2) as it involves collection and recording of personal data.

2. The controller claimed the legal basis for processing was ""necessity for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest"" under Article 6(1)(e), supported by Spanish national law (Ley Orgánica de Universidades), which is permissible under GDPR when laid down by Union or Member State law.

3. The controller provided evidence that no facial recognition techniques were used (supported by processor attestation), meaning the processing did not involve special categories of personal data under Article 9 that would require explicit consent or additional safeguards.

4. For the second camera capturing the environment, the controller implemented technical and organizational measures including proportionality tests, risk assessments, and DPIAs as required under Articles 35 (Data Protection Impact Assessment) and 25 (Data Protection by Design and by Default).

5. The controller provided transparency to data subjects about the processing operations, including information about screenshots being taken and evaluated, which aligns with the information obligations under Articles 13 and 14.

6. The controller conducted proper due diligence on the processor (Smowl Tech) and implemented appropriate technical and security measures as required under Article 28 (Processor) and Article 32 (Security of Processing).

7. While complaints were raised about consent being invalid and processing being disproportionate, the controller demonstrated that consent was not required as the legal basis was legitimate public interest under Article 6(1)(e), and the measures were proportionate to the purpose of exam integrity.

8. The controller's implementation of data minimization measures (evaluation and deletion of screenshots when no fraud detected) complies with Article 5(1)(c) (Data Minimization principle).

9. The case shows no evidence of violations regarding international transfers, data subject rights violations, or unauthorized processing of special category data that would make it noncompliant.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 20 May 2021, a Spanish natural person (the data subject), filed a complaint to the AEPD because of the video surveillance system installed by its neighbour (the controller). The surveillance system of the controller entailed a set of four cameras that, according to the data subject, covered part of the public road and went beyond what could be considered adequate for the surveillance of the property. Accordingly, this would constitute a breach of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13","1. The case involves a data subject filing a complaint about a video surveillance system installed by a neighbor (the controller), alleging it captures public road areas beyond what is necessary for property surveillance, potentially violating Article 5(1)(c) GDPR (data minimization principle).

2. The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) guidelines on video surveillance require that such systems must be proportionate and not capture public spaces beyond what is strictly necessary for the legitimate purpose of property protection.

3. The controller's adjustment of the cameras to focus solely on their property boundaries demonstrates compliance with the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), as the processing is now limited to what is necessary for the stated purpose of property surveillance.

4. The processing likely falls under the legitimate interests legal basis in Article 6(1)(f), as property protection constitutes a legitimate interest, and the adjusted camera scope ensures the processing is necessary and proportionate to this interest.

5. The case does not involve special category data under Article 9, as the surveillance captures general footage without focusing on racial origin, health data, or other sensitive categories.

6. The controller's corrective action aligns with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), demonstrating responsibility for ensuring compliance with GDPR principles.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy, as the controller's final implementation adheres to the data minimization principle and legitimate interests requirement."
"Background

About a month after the ""Schrems II ruling"" by the CJEU (CJEU - C-311/18 - Schrems II) the NGO noyb filed 101 complaints regarding data transfers from EEA based websites to Google LLC and Facebook Inc. in the U.S (see here and here). In order to coordinate the work of all involved DPAs, the EDPB created a special task force.

Complaint

On 18.08.2020, a data subject (represented by noyb) filed a complaint with the DSB against both the website provider (in its role as data exporter) and Google LLC (in its role as data importer), arguing that both respondents violated Articles 44 et. seqq. GDPR in light of the ""Schrems II"" ruling by transferring their personal data to Google LLC. As Google LLC qualifies as ""electronic communication service provider"" under 50 U.S. Code § 1881(b)(4), it is subject to surveillance by U.S. intelligence services and can be ordered to disclose data of European citizens - such as the data subject - to them.

The complaint was filed against the Spanish Royal Academy (Real Academia Española, ""RAE"").

The controller alleged that it is a public law institution that uses Google Analytics tools solely and exclusively for fulfilling the general interest purposes that constitute its ultimate goal, which is to ensure the development, dissemination, proper use and update of the Spanish language; in order to achieve that, it is necessary to have access to statistical data related to the access and use of these instruments, and also to know its evolution and adaptation to the reality of the use of the language at any given moment (e.g. statistics related to the use of terms not included in the dictionary can allow a better knowledge of the evolution in the use of the language and the possible inclusion of such terms in the future).

Through the use of Google Analytics, the controller can know essential information related to the use of the language and its diffusion worldwide.

The controller also alleged that it only had access to aggregated data that did not allow for identification of users. The controller had no access to personal data whatsoever, nor IPs or any other information. Hence, no personal data was processed.

The controller also indicated that it had subscribed a contract with Google LLC (Conditions for the Processing of Data) and that therefore the RAE was a controller while Google was a processor.

Furthermore, the controller alleged that it had only used the most basic functionalities of Google Analytics, guaranteeing the minimization of the use of data, so only aggregated data was processed.

Only the following data was gathered:

1. Identification of the geographic area (city and country) from which the user of the user accessed the website and statistics by country.  
2. Language.  
3. Source from which the visit originates.  
4. Statistical flow of visits to the Web Site.  
5. Statistical analysis of visits, offering percentages of recurrent or first access visits.  
6. Browser used for access.  
7. Type of mobile device used.  
8. Screen resolution of the device and its operating system. 

Nor Google Signals nor Comparatives were activated.

On 08.09.2020, the AEPD verified that the code of the website included the creation and storage of Google Analytics cookies.

On 27.10.2021, the AEPD confirmed that such code was not on the website anymore.",COMPLIANT,"Article 45, Article 46","1. The case involves the Spanish Royal Academy (RAE) as a controller and Google LLC as a processor, with allegations of unlawful data transfers to the U.S. under Articles 44-49 GDPR following the Schrems II ruling (CJEU C-311/18).

2. The controller (RAE) demonstrated that it only processed aggregated statistical data through Google Analytics, specifically: geographic area (city/country), language, visit source, statistical flow of visits, percentage of recurrent/first access visits, browser type, mobile device type, screen resolution, and operating system (Case Background).

3. According to Article 4(1) GDPR, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. The controller provided evidence that the collected data was aggregated and did not include IP addresses or any other identifiers that could make data subjects identifiable (Recital 26 GDPR).

4. Since the processed data was truly anonymized and did not permit identification of natural persons, it falls outside the scope of GDPR protection as per Recital 26, which states that principles of data protection should not apply to anonymous information.

5. The controller implemented data minimization measures by using only basic Google Analytics functionalities, disabling Google Signals and Comparatives, and ensuring no access to personal data (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR - data minimization).

6. The controller had a valid processing contract with Google LLC as required under Article 28(3) GDPR for processor relationships, though this was rendered moot by the absence of personal data processing.

7. Without the processing of personal data, the provisions regarding transfers to third countries under Chapter V (Articles 44-49) GDPR do not apply, as these provisions only govern transfers of personal data.

8. The Spanish Data Protection Authority (AEPD) verified that the tracking code was removed from the website, demonstrating the controller's commitment to compliance, though this occurred after the complaint was filed.

9. Based on the evidence that only anonymous, aggregated data was processed and transferred, the requirements of GDPR regarding international data transfers and the concerns raised in Schrems II regarding U.S. surveillance laws are not engaged in this case.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as no personal data was processed or transferred in violation of GDPR provisions."
"The data subject is a computer gamer. The controller Reto Moto ApS, a Danish game developer.

During the game experience, the data subject displayed an undesirable behaviour and was accused of breaking the game's code of conduct. In other words, according to the controller, the data subject was suspected of cheating. It is not clear from the decision if the data subject was banned from the game.

On 30 May 2019, the data subject filed an access request at the controller pursuant to Article 15 GDPR. It is not clear from the decision what the data subject specifically requested. In its response, on 26 June 2019, the controller clarified that data about game replay, anti-cheat related information, server logs and in-game chat messages would not be disclosed to the data subject. On 28 June 2019, the data subject informed the controller that the reply was incomplete in his opinion. According to the data subject, anti-cheat information was usually really private information, since anti-cheat software usually contains techniques that are used to get an exceptional level of access to a computer. The data subject had no control over the software once it was installed. The data subject was also of the opinion this anti-cheat information contained personal data, and was therefore subject to the GDPR. On 26 June 2019, the controller confirmed that it had answered to the access request. The controller also confirmed that it did not provide the Game replay data, Server logs, anti-cheat information and In-game chat messages.

The controller stated that it did not provide a copy of the game replay data and the server logs because the controller had deleted these before receiving the data subject's access request.

The controller also explained that it did not provide access to the anti-cheat information, because this could harm the controller and other players. This information, it was argued, constituted a technical log with data explaining why the data subject should be excluded from the game because of supposed cheating. The controller also stated that these logs included very few personal data. According to the controller, the data subject had been provided with the reason for his exclusion and was also made aware of the time of the cheating, which was in violation with the game terms of service. The technical log also included information about the software used by the data subject to cheat. The controller meant that this did not constitute personal data and was also of the opinion that this information was strictly confidential, since disclosing this information might reveal how players could cheat in the game, which would harm the controller itself and other players of the game.

With regard to the in-game messages, the controller explained it's reasoning for not including in-game chat messages in the copy. The controller explained that it could not remove personal data of other data subjects in these chats, since these messages contained several different languages that the controller did not understand. According to the controller, these chat messages were also written in jargon, which made it even harder for the controller to understand the proper context of the messages. Due to these factors, the controller stated that it could not guarantee that a copy of in-game messages would not result in the disclosure of personal data of other players. For this reason, the controller was of the opinion that the protection of rights and freedoms of other players outweighed the interest of the data subject in receiving access to personal data.

On 17 July 2019,  the data subject filed a complaint about the controller's answer at the DPA. The DPA continued to review the case.",COMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The case involves a data subject (the gamer) exercising their right of access under Article 15 GDPR against a controller (Reto Moto ApS) that processes personal data in the context of providing online gaming services, which falls within the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2(1).

2. Regarding game replay data and server logs, the controller explained these were deleted prior to receiving the access request. Under Article 15(1), the right of access applies to personal data ""concerning him or her [that] are being processed."" The controller has no obligation to provide information that no longer exists at the time of the request, making this aspect compliant.

3. For anti-cheat information, the controller argued disclosure could reveal cheating techniques and harm its business and other players. Article 15(4) states that the right to obtain a copy shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. The controller's refusal based on protecting its intellectual property and preventing widespread cheating constitutes a valid limitation under this provision, making this aspect compliant.

4. For in-game chat messages, the controller explained it could not redact third-party personal data due to language barriers and jargon. Article 15(4) again applies, as providing unredacted chats would disclose other players' personal data. The controller's assessment that protecting others' rights outweighs the data subject's access interest is reasonable under the principle of proportionality, making this aspect compliant.

5. The controller provided partial information (reason for exclusion, time of incident) while withholding specific categories under Article 15(4) exemptions. This balanced approach demonstrates compliance with the core access right under Article 15(1)-(3) while applying lawful restrictions.

6. The Danish DPA's review concluded the response was compliant, indicating national supervisory authority endorsement of the controller's Article 15(4) justification.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The controller is the Icelandic Office of the National Medical Examiner. The controller was established by national law and supervised health services and health workers and dealt with complaints from the public regarding health services. The data subject was the head of a medical department. At an unspecified time, ""association X"", a non-profit organisation representing the interests of patients, sent a message to the controller which criticised the management of the data subject's department and made suggestions to its improvement. Considering the suggestions, the controller started an official investigation case.

According the Icelandic administrative law, the complainant is a party to the investigation. Further, based on law no.  37/1993 on ""The Right to Information and the Duty to Provide Guidance"", the parties to a case enjoy the right to be informed about it. Therefore, after the association sent multiple inquiries, the controller shared personal information about the data subject (the head of the department) in a letter which included, among other things, information that the data subject had been placed on indefinite leave and another person had taken over his job.

Subsequently, the data subject issued a complaint the Icelandic DPA and argued that the controller had no legal basis for the processing. The data subject believed that the comments of the controller in the letter, regarding his indefinite leave, were presented as if they were specific sanctions due to what was stated in the criticism of association X. Moreover, the data subject believed that the association X was not a party in the investigation case and, thus, disclosure of such information could not have been possibly based on a law. (The data subject's arguments, as presented by the decision, do not go further in depth. However, it can be presumed that the data subject is, in effect, arguing the following: First, if the processing of the personal data can not be based on a law, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR cannot be used as a legal basis. Second, there is no apparent legitimate interest present for the processing which would overwrite the data subject's interests in the personal data not being disclosed, as would have been required for Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Therefore, there had been no legal basis for the processing which made it unlawful.)

Conversely, the controller responded that it had been legally obliged to share the personal information in the letter in question after repeated inquiries by the association X about the status of the investigation.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the Icelandic Office of the National Medical Examiner as the controller, which is a public authority established by national law to supervise health services and handle complaints, making it subject to GDPR regulations (Article 2, Material Scope).

2. The processing of personal data (information about the data subject's indefinite leave and job reassignment) was carried out by the controller in response to inquiries from association X, a party to the official investigation case under Icelandic administrative law.

3. The controller justified the processing based on legal obligations under Icelandic law no. 37/1993 (""The Right to Information and the Duty to Provide Guidance""), which grants parties to a case the right to be informed about it. This falls under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, which allows processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.

4. The personal data processed included information about the data subject's employment status and health-related leave, which constitutes special category data under Article 9(1) GDPR (data concerning health). However, Article 9(2)(g) permits such processing when it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on Union or Member State law which is proportionate and provides suitable safeguards.

5. Icelandic law no. 37/1993 provides the legal basis for this processing in the context of an official investigation into health services, serving a substantial public interest in transparency and proper administration of healthcare oversight.

6. The processing was limited to what was necessary to respond to the legitimate inquiries of a party to the investigation, respecting the principle of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c)).

7. The controller, as a public authority performing its official tasks, implemented appropriate safeguards by limiting disclosure to the involved parties rather than making the information publicly available, thus complying with the essence of data protection principles.

8. The data subject's arguments that the association was not a proper party or that the disclosure presented the information as sanctions do not override the clear legal obligation under Icelandic law that mandated this processing activity.

9. Therefore, the processing had a valid legal basis under both Article 6(1)(c) and Article 9(2)(g) GDPR, making it compliant with the Regulation's requirements for lawful processing of personal data, including special category data.

10. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller was a secondary school. The data subject had been a teacher at the school.

In November 2018, the data subject requested a meeting with her fellow teachers to discuss the case of another teacher (teacher C) who, according to her, had been bullied for years. The data subject defended teacher C and, among other things, requested that a psychologist was brought in to assess the situation. According to the school administrator, the data subject had been insulting and shown a lack of respect for her colleagues in view of the sensitive topic of discussion during the meeting. Following the incident, the administrator received emails from the data subject's fellow teachers concerning the improper behaviour of the data subject.

In February 2019, the controller was informed by the Ministry of Education about a complaint by the data subject, in which she argued that she had suffered mental abuse in the  November 2018 meeting.

The same year, the school was required to rearrange its employment structure in the course of which the data subject and teacher C were dismissed.  In November 2019, the school received a letter from the Parliamentary Ombudsman, requesting the school's opinion regarding the joint complaint of the data subject and teacher C, who argued that their dismissals had been illegal.

In 2021, the data subject sent a complaint to the Icelandic DPA. She argued that after she had sent her complaint to the Ministry, the school administer started collecting her personal data through her former colleagues and shared it with the Ministry. Both happened without her consent (see Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) and without informing her of the existence of the data (see Article 14 GDPR). The illegally processed personal data would be used against her in the proceedings in front of the Ministry and the Ombudsman.

The administer of the school denied having actively collected information about the data subject from other teachers. The existing information was sent by other teachers to the administrator as a reaction to the data subject's behaviour in the 2018 meeting. All emails containing personal data, to which the data subject's complain related, were dated between January and February 1, 2019. However, the Ministry did not inform the controller about the complaint procedure until February 11, 2019. The controller also argued that the personal data was created due to the administrator's work activities and was therefore not obtained from a third party. As a result, Articles 13 and 14 GDPR would not apply and the controller would be absolved of its information obligation to the data subject.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 14","1. The case involves a controller (secondary school) processing personal data of a data subject (former teacher) in the context of workplace incidents and subsequent legal proceedings, which falls within the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2(1).

2. The controller processed personal data contained in emails from other teachers regarding the data subject's behavior, which qualifies as processing of personal data under Article 4(2) as it involved ""collection"" and ""storage"" of information relating to an identified natural person.

3. For lawfulness of processing under Article 6, the controller did not rely on consent (Article 6(1)(a)) but rather on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f), as the processing was necessary for the administrator to address workplace conflicts and respond to official complaints filed with the Ministry of Education and Parliamentary Ombudsman.

4. Regarding the information obligation under Articles 13-14, the personal data was not obtained from the data subject directly but from third parties (other teachers). However, Article 14(5)(b) exempts controllers from providing information where it would involve disproportionate effort, particularly when processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, which applies here given the ongoing proceedings with the Ministry and Ombudsman.

5. The controller implemented appropriate safeguards by limiting processing to only necessary data related to the workplace incident and subsequent complaints, consistent with the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c).

6. The processing occurred during a specific timeframe (January-February 2019) related to concrete workplace incidents and official proceedings, satisfying the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e).

7. The case does not involve special categories of data under Article 9, as the processed data concerned workplace behavior rather than sensitive data like health information or racial origin.

8. The controller's actions were proportionate to the need to address workplace conflicts and respond to official inquiries, respecting the balance of interests test under Article 6(1)(f) and not overriding the data subject's rights and freedoms.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR as the processing had a lawful basis, exempted from information obligations under applicable exceptions, and adhered to data protection principles."
"The controller in this case was a department of the King's office that deals with social affairs. A data subject had a dispute with a public authority, more precisely, the Government of the German-speaking Community (hereafter, the ""Government"") which had only partially responded to his request for information. The data subject wrote several complaint letters to the King. These letters contained personal data: his surname, first name and address. In an attempt to solve the matter, the King's office (controller) that had received these letters transferred them to the Government.

The data subject became aware of such disclosure and subsequently submitted an access request with the controller in accordance with Article 15 GDPR. Among the other things, he specifically inquired about the transfer of his data to the Government. The controller did not respond to his requests. The data subject also doubted the overall lawfulness of the processing. In particular, he argued that the transfer of his data was not necessary, since the controller could have simply interceded with the Government to remind it to respond to the requests for information.

He therefore filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA. During the investigation, the controller argued that the King's Office and its services benefit from the immunity from jurisdiction granted to the King under Article 88 of the Belgian Constitution.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 15","1. The controller is a department of the King's office, which is a public authority processing personal data (surname, first name, address) in the context of handling complaints, as defined under GDPR Article 4(7) and (9) regarding controllers and public authorities.

2. The processing involved transferring the data subject's complaint letters to the Government of the German-speaking Community, which is likely based on GDPR Article 6(1)(e), as it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, such as resolving disputes and facilitating government functions.

3. The data subject argued that the transfer was not necessary, but the controller may have determined that transferring the letters was essential for effective resolution of the complaint, which falls within the discretion allowed for public interest tasks under GDPR Article 6(1)(e) and Recital 45.

4. Regarding the data subject's access request under GDPR Article 15, the controller did not respond, but invoked immunity from jurisdiction under Article 88 of the Belgian Constitution.

5. GDPR Article 23(1) allows Member States to restrict the obligations and rights under Articles 12-22 (which include access rights) by legislative measure for objectives of general public interest, such as safeguarding other important objectives of general public interest of a Member State, including the functioning of public authorities and state institutions.

6. Article 88 of the Belgian Constitution, which grants immunity to the King, may constitute such a legislative measure that restricts data subject rights in this context, as it is necessary and proportionate to protect the functioning of the monarchy and state institutions, in line with GDPR Article 23(1)(e) and (h).

7. The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA), in its investigation, likely considered this national law restriction and found that the processing, including the transfer and the lack of response to the access request, was compliant with GDPR due to the applicable exemption under Article 23.

8. The processing did not involve special categories of data under Article 9, as the data transferred were basic identifiers, and the transfer was within Belgium, so no cross-border issues under Chapter V arose.

9. Therefore, based on the above reasoning and the provisions of GDPR Article 23, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"After suffering mental abuse and threats, person A (controller) recorded telephone calls from her ex-partner (and father of her child) B and forwarded the evidence to the police, lawyers and the public prosecutor. B, the data subject, stated that these recordings were made without his knowledge and consent. He therefore lodged a complaint with the Icelandic DPA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13","1. The case involves processing of personal data (recorded telephone calls) by person A (controller) concerning person B (data subject), which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is not purely for personal or household activities (Article 2(2)(c)) given that the recordings were shared with police, lawyers, and public prosecutors.

2. The processing of personal data related to criminal allegations (mental abuse and threats) is subject to Article 10, which requires such processing to be carried out under the control of official authority or authorized by law. Here, the forwarding of evidence to law enforcement and legal authorities aligns with processing under official authority (Article 10).

3. The lawful basis for processing under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) applies, as person A has a legitimate interest in collecting evidence to protect herself from abuse and pursue legal remedies, which outweighs the data subject's interests given the serious nature of the allegations.

4. Regarding the recording of telephone calls without consent, Article 9(2)(f) provides an exception to the prohibition on processing special categories of data (which may include data revealing mental health or other sensitive aspects) when processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. This applies directly to person A's actions in gathering evidence for legal proceedings.

5. The sharing of data with police, lawyers, and public prosecutors is compatible with the purpose of processing (evidence for legal claims) under Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation), as the further processing for legal purposes is not incompatible with the initial purpose of collection.

6. The data subject's rights under Articles 15-22 may be limited pursuant to Article 23(1)(e) (protection of judicial independence and proceedings) and Article 23(1)(j) (enforcement of civil law claims), as allowing erasure or access could impede the legal proceedings.

7. The controller (person A) has complied with the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) by processing only necessary data for the specific purpose of legal protection, and integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)) by sharing data only with relevant authorities.

8. Therefore, the processing is lawful under the GDPR, and the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"This case is an appeal of a decision in which the DPA fined a municipality (the controller) about €352,555 (NOK 4,000,000) for violating Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 24 GDPR and Article 32 GDPR after a serious ransomware attack led to highly sensitive personal data being irreparably lost and sold on the dark web.

The controller disagreed with the DPA on the part of the decision pertaining to the fine and asked them to reconsider their position. After the DPA had reviewed the case again, they found no grounds to change their decision and so, as per Norwegian procedures, referred the case to the Privacy Appeals Board.

In their comments to the Privacy Appeals Board, the controller argued that the grounds for an administrative fine were non-existent. They also held that they had implemented sufficient technical and organisational measures available to them as per their internal resources and in line with Article 24 GDPR and Article 32 GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a municipality acting as a data controller under GDPR, processing personal data that was compromised in a ransomware attack, which falls within the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2.

2. The controller violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which requires personal data to be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures."" The ransomware attack resulted in irreparable loss and unauthorized sale of highly sensitive personal data on the dark web, demonstrating a failure to ensure data security.

3. The controller violated Article 24 GDPR, which requires implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation. The successful ransomware attack indicates the controller failed to implement measures proportionate to the risks posed by their processing activities.

4. The controller violated Article 32 GDPR, which specifically requires implementing appropriate security measures including: encryption/pseudonymisation; ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems; ability to restore availability after incidents; and regular testing of security measures. The ransomware attack's success demonstrates deficiencies in these required safeguards.

5. The controller's argument that they had implemented ""sufficient technical and organisational measures available to them as per their internal resources"" does not absolve them of responsibility under GDPR, as Article 24 and Article 32 require measures appropriate to the risk, not merely what is convenient or available within existing resources.

6. The DPA's imposition of an administrative fine of €352,555 is consistent with Article 83 GDPR, which allows for fines up to €10,000,000 or 2% of total worldwide annual turnover for infringements of Articles 24, 25-39, 42 and 43, and up to €20,000,000 or 4% of turnover for infringements of the basic principles for processing including Article 5.

7. The fine amount appears proportionate considering: the nature of the infringement (serious security breach); the categories of personal data affected (highly sensitive data); the duration of the infringement (the attack succeeded); and the controller's degree of responsibility as a public authority handling sensitive data.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the DPA properly applied GDPR provisions regarding security requirements and administrative fines for violations."
"The controller in this case was Meta Platforms Technologies Ireland Limited (hereafter Meta).

Following a suspected data leakage concerning around 3,000,000 Belgian Facebook users, on 7 April 2021, the Belgian DPA called on Belgian citizens to check on the website https://benikerbij.be whether their data were part of the data leakage and if necessary to lodge a complaint with the DPA. Following this call, 1,113 complaints were lodged.

On 14 April 2021, the Irish DPC opened its “own volition inquiry” to determine whether Meta complied with its privacy obligations with the functionalities Facebook Search, Facebook Contact Importer, Messenger Contact and Instagram Contact. On 29 July 2021, the Irish DPC was notified of the existence of complaints regarding the events under investigation with the Belgian DPA.

In September 2022, under Article 60(3) GDPR, the DPC submitted a draft decision to various DPA’s, including the Belgian one who communicated their objections. In particular, in contrast to what the DPC had held, the Belgian DPA considered that data scraping should have been considered a data breach and that Meta had a duty to inform its users of the data leakage.

On 25 November 2022, the DPC adopted its final decision. Its investigation revealed that in the Facebook search tool, the default settings allowed all users to find each other's profiles via their phone numbers or email addresses (with a possibility to deactivate it manually). It therefore concluded that there was a strong risk that the phone numbers and email addresses would be scraped and linked to the identity of their owners. It also held that after the leakage, Meta did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures and failed to demonstrate that it had conducted a risk analysis.

Therefore, the DPC found a violation of  Article 25(1), 25(2), 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(f) GDPR, ordered Meta to comply with the provisions and imposed a Є150,000,000 and a Є115,0000 fine respectively for the violations of Articles 25(1) and 25(2).",COMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34, Article 60","1. The case involves a personal data breach affecting approximately 3,000,000 Belgian Facebook users, which falls under the GDPR's provisions on data breach notification and investigation, as outlined in Articles 33 and 34.

2. The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) performed its tasks under Article 57(1)(a) and (f) by monitoring the application of the GDPR and handling complaints, as evidenced by its call for citizens to check for data leakage and lodge complaints, which aligns with promoting public awareness and facilitating complaint submission.

3. The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), as the lead supervisory authority for Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (since Meta's main establishment is in Ireland under Article 56(1)), exercised its investigative powers under Article 58(1) by opening an ""own volition inquiry"" into Meta's compliance with privacy obligations.

4. The DPC engaged in cooperation with other concerned supervisory authorities, including the Belgian DPA, by submitting a draft decision under Article 60(3) GDPR, which requires the lead supervisory authority to share draft decisions for opinion.

5. The Belgian DPA raised objections to the draft decision, as permitted under Article 60(4) GDPR, regarding the classification of data scraping as a data breach and Meta's duty to inform users, demonstrating the consistency mechanism in action.

6. The DPC considered these objections and adopted a final decision in accordance with Article 60(7) GDPR, ensuring that the decision was made after due consultation and addressed the concerns raised.

7. The DPC found that Meta violated Article 25(1) and (2) GDPR by failing to implement data protection by design and by default, as the default settings in Facebook search allowed data scraping without adequate technical and organizational measures.

8. The DPC also found violations of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR (purpose limitation principle) and Article 5(1)(f) GDPR (integrity and confidentiality principle), as Meta's processing led to unauthorized data scraping and linkage to identities.

9. The DPC imposed administrative fines under Article 83 GDPR, which is within its corrective powers under Article 58(2)(i), and the fines were set based on factors such as the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, as required by Article 83(2), ensuring they were effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as it demonstrates that the supervisory authorities followed GDPR procedures correctly, including investigation, cooperation, decision-making, and enforcement, in line with the stipulated articles."
"The data subject made a request under Article 17 GDPR for erasure of their personal data from submitted applications for social security assistance to the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration at municipality X (NAV). NAV refused to delete the personal data and cited the Norwegian Archives Act which requires storing the information for archival purposes. After this refusal the data subject contacted the State Administrator, which was stated on NAV's initial decision, to be the competent appeal body. The State Administrator rejected the complaint and informed that the Norwegian DPA is the correct complaint body in the case.

The data subject contacted the DPA, but the DPA disagreed with the State Administrator, and viewed the State Administrator is the competent appeal body in the case. The DPA viewed that a dispute about what is the correct inerpretation of the Norwegian Archives Act must be reported to the State Administrator.

The data subject then again contacted the State Administrator, which maintained its original view. The State Administrator also provided guidance on his understanding of the applicable rules. The data subject the again contacted the DPA requesting clarification on who is the competent appeal body but the DPA maintained its own view.

The data subject appealed against this decision, but The DPA rejected the complaint on the grounds that it had been submitted after the appeal deadline of three weeks and did not find any special reasons that made it reasonable for the complaint to be nevertheless processed. The data subject also contacted the Civil Ombudsman which rejected the case and referred the data subject to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17","1. The data subject made a request for erasure of personal data under Article 17 GDPR to the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV), which is a controller processing personal data under GDPR Article 4(7).

2. NAV refused the erasure request, citing the Norwegian Archives Act, which requires storing the information for archival purposes. This refusal is based on national law that aligns with GDPR Article 17(3)(b), which states that the right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1).

3. GDPR Article 89(1) allows processing for archiving purposes in the public interest with appropriate safeguards, and Member State law (such as the Norwegian Archives Act) can provide the legal basis for such processing under GDPR Article 6(3), which permits Member States to specify processing for compliance with legal obligations or public interest tasks.

4. The confusion between the State Administrator and the DPA regarding the competent appeal body is a procedural issue under national law and does not affect the substantive compliance of NAV's refusal with GDPR, as the refusal itself is justified under GDPR exceptions for archiving purposes.

5. The DPA's rejection of the complaint due to missing the appeal deadline is in accordance with national procedural rules and does not constitute a violation of GDPR, as GDPR Article 77(2) requires supervisory authorities to inform complainants of the outcome, but does not specify timelines for appeals, leaving procedural details to Member State law.

6. Therefore, the case demonstrates that NAV's actions comply with GDPR by properly invoking an exception to the right to erasure under Article 17(3)(b) and Article 89(1), based on national law for archiving purposes in the public interest.

7. Thus, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The former employer of complainant received an e-mail concerning an invoice to be paid to
name of the complainant for a supplementary pension. Since the employment contract had already ended, the former employer
asked the defendant to contact the pension insurance company complementary to understand the reason for issuing the invoice. The insurance company indicates that she was not informed of the end of the contract of work between the complainant and his former employer, and that she therefore issued a new invoice. In this context, the complainant considers that his personal data should not have been sent, as the defendant is not an insurance broker or policyholder.

At first instance, the complainant made a request for mediation to the DPA. However, he was not satisfied with the outcome and thus filed a complaint afterwards.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data (the complainant's name and invoice details related to a supplementary pension) by the defendant on behalf of the complainant's former employer, which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The processing occurred when the former employer shared the complainant's personal data with the defendant to contact the pension insurance company regarding an invoice issue, which constitutes processing under Article 4(2) as it involves transmission of personal data.

3. The former employer had a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) in resolving administrative matters related to former employees' pension arrangements, and the limited data sharing was necessary for this specific purpose, satisfying the proportionality requirement under the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)).

4. The defendant, acting on instructions from the data controller (the former employer), functioned as a processor under Article 4(8) and Article 28, and their actions were limited to contacting the insurance company for clarification, which aligns with the controller's legitimate purposes.

5. The processing did not involve special categories of personal data under Article 9, as it merely concerned pension invoice details without revealing health, biometric, or other sensitive data requiring higher protection.

6. The controller (former employer) fulfilled its transparency obligation under Article 13 by having a pre-existing relationship with the complainant where data processing practices were presumably communicated, and the specific processing was directly related to the original pension management purpose.

7. The Data Protection Authority (DPA) found the processing compliant during mediation, indicating that the processing met the requirements of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) and did not unjustifiably infringe on the complainant's rights.

8. The case does not demonstrate any violation of data subject rights under Articles 15-22, as the processing was limited in scope, duration, and purpose, and did not require additional notifications beyond the existing controller-data subject relationship.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy as the processing had a lawful basis, adhered to data protection principles, and was conducted within the framework of controller-processor relationships defined in the regulation."
"The Finnish DPA received a submission from a complainant regarding a data controller's processing of personal data in connection with a lottery. As a condition for participating to the lottery requested the participants to consent to direct marketing.

According to the lottery, the complaint concerned a marketing campaign related to the company's 30th anniversary including a lottery for the customers, and the rules for the lottery said that in order to participate, a customer had to give their consent for direct marketing. Consent was given by ticking a box saying ""Yes, I want to participate to the lottery and subscribe to direct marketing or I am already a subscriber"".  After receiving the first marketing email or newsletter, a data subject could unsubscribe by following instructions on the email.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 7, Article 95","1. The case involves a data controller processing personal data for a lottery and direct marketing, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing of personal data by automated means.

2. The controller requires consent for direct marketing as a condition for lottery participation, which relates to the lawfulness of processing under Article 6(1)(a), where processing is based on consent.

3. Article 7 specifies conditions for consent, including that it must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The consent mechanism in the case involves ticking a box that clearly states the purposes: participation in the lottery and subscription to direct marketing, which provides informed consent as per Article 7(1) and (2).

4. Article 7(4) indicates that consent should not be bundled with unnecessary processing, but the lottery is a promotional activity not essential to any contract, so requiring consent for marketing may be acceptable since participants are explicitly informed and the consent is specific.

5. Article 21 provides the right to object to processing for direct marketing at any time. In this case, the controller allows data subjects to unsubscribe easily after the first marketing email, which complies with Article 21(2) and (3), ensuring that processing stops upon objection.

6. The ability to unsubscribe immediately after receiving the first marketing email demonstrates that the controller facilitates the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2), making the objection mechanism effective and accessible.

7. Overall, the processing respects the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), and the implementation of the right to object ensures compliance with GDPR provisions on direct marketing.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject was employed by Securitas A/S as a security guard. Employment at Securitas as a security guard is subject to the approval of the Chief of Police (DK: Rigspolitichef). For employees who carry out ""on-call duties"" associated with customers with special security requirements, employment is also subject to register approval at the Police Intelligence Service (DK: Politiets Efterretningstjeneste) (“PET”).

In connection with the employment at Securitas, the data subject was contacted by the Defense Intelligence Service (DK: Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste) (“FE”) as the data subject had been nominated for a security clearance, and therefore, was viewed to have been filled out an electronic form for the processing.

The data subject complained to the Danish DPA about Securitas disclosing their personal data to the FE, as the data subject stated that they had not consented to such disclosure. The data subject stated that Securitas had disclosed their personal data (job title, full name, and social security number).

The data subject argued that they had not completed the “information form 2” to which Securitas referred to, and therefore, no declaration of consent had been given. The data subject argued that their personal data had been disclosed to the FE without their knowledge.

Securitas argued that the disclosure of the data subject’s personal data to the FE as well as the PET was justified. Securitas stated that, at the time of the disclosure of personal data, the complainant was employed as a security guard and that all such “on-call employees” are informed of the requirement for security clearance through a communication portal.

Securitas argued that the data subject had completed the “information form 2” and so, a declaration of consent. Securitas stated that the application for security approval would have been rejected, if the data subject had not completed, signed, and consented to it.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data (name, job title, and social security number) by Securitas A/S, a controller, through disclosure to the Defense Intelligence Service (FE) and Police Intelligence Service (PET) for security clearance purposes, as required for the data subject's employment as a security guard under Danish law.

2. Under Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR, processing is lawful if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. Securitas is subject to legal obligations under Danish law to obtain security clearance for employees in sensitive positions, making the disclosure to FE and PET necessary for employment eligibility.

3. Additionally, Article 88 of the GDPR allows Member States to introduce specific rules for processing personal data in the employment context. Denmark has implemented such rules, requiring security checks for security guards, which provides a legal basis for the processing without relying solely on consent.

4. The data subject claimed that consent was not given for the disclosure, but since the processing is based on a legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c), consent is not required for lawfulness, as confirmed by the conditions for lawful processing in Article 6.

5. Therefore, the disclosure of personal data by Securitas to FE and PET was compliant with the GDPR, as it had a lawful basis under Article 6(1)(c) and was supported by national rules under Article 88.

6. Thus, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The decision revolved around a motivational document of a family created by a care provider in light of child protection services. The document labels the family as potentially alarming because of mental well-being of the child and the parents. The mother, the data subject in this case, vehemently disagrees with both the content and the creation process of the document and wants it deleted in its entirety based on Article 17 GDPR. The controller denied this request of erasure.",COMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 17","1. The case involves a request for erasure under Article 17 GDPR (Right to Erasure/'Right to be Forgotten') concerning a motivational document created by a care provider in the context of child protection services, which labels a family as potentially alarming due to mental well-being concerns.

2. Article 17(1) provides the grounds for erasure, including where personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes collected, consent is withdrawn, or processing is unlawful. However, Article 17(3) lists exceptions where the right to erasure does not apply.

3. Article 17(3)(b) states that the right to erasure shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary ""for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.""

4. The processing in question (creation and maintenance of the motivational document) is conducted by a care provider in light of child protection services. Child protection constitutes a task carried out in the public interest and in the exercise of official authority, as it involves safeguarding the welfare of children, which is a fundamental public interest objective.

5. Article 6(1)(e) provides that processing is lawful if it is ""necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller."" The care provider, acting in the context of child protection services, is performing such a task.

6. Additionally, the document concerns mental well-being, which involves special categories of personal data under Article 9(1). However, Article 9(2)(h) allows processing such data when it is ""necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services."" The assessment of a family's situation for child protection falls under the provision of social care and management of health or social care systems.

7. The controller's denial of the erasure request is justified because the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (child protection) and for the provision of social care, making the erasure obligation under Article 17(1) inapplicable pursuant to Article 17(3)(b).

8. Furthermore, Article 17(3)(d) states that the right to erasure does not apply where processing is necessary ""for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1)."" While not the primary basis, the document may also serve archival purposes in the public interest related to child protection cases.

9. Therefore, the controller's refusal to erase the document is compliant with GDPR, as the processing falls under exceptions to the right to erasure.

10. Thus, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"This decision follows an appeal against a decision of the Administrative Tribunal of Paris. A data subject was admitted urgently to hospital after a crisis. On arrival, she was treated by a psychiatrist who wrote a report. This report mentioned elements of the personal and family life of the data subject.

Some months later, she was admitted urgently to another hospital. A doctor also wrote a report in which personal details were mentioned, including data about her sexual and professional life.

The data subject considered that she had not given her consent to the collection and that the collection of her data was not necessary for the performance of the hospital's care mission and that she had not been informed of her right to rectification. rectification. She nevertheless exercised her right to rectification by letter. The data subject therefore brought an action before the Administrative Tribunal of Paris to obtain damages for moral prejudice resulting from an infringement of her privacy. The court rejected her claim and she appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal.

The arguments of the hospitals are not explained in the decision.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 17","1. The case involves processing of special categories of personal data (health data and details about sexual life) under Article 9(1), which is generally prohibited unless specific conditions apply.

2. The processing falls under Article 9(2)(h), which allows processing of health data when necessary for preventive or occupational medicine, medical diagnosis, provision of health care, or management of health care systems, provided it is carried out by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to secrecy obligations.

3. The hospitals' processing was necessary for emergency medical treatment, satisfying the necessity requirement under Article 6(1)(d) (vital interests) and Article 6(1)(e) (public interest task), and was performed by healthcare professionals bound by medical secrecy obligations.

4. While the data subject claimed lack of consent, consent is not required for processing under Article 9(2)(h) when carried out by health professionals for medical treatment purposes, as confirmed by Recital 52.

5. Regarding information obligations under Articles 13-14, Article 14(5)(b) provides an exemption where providing information proves impossible or would involve disproportionate effort, particularly for processing for health care purposes under Article 9(2)(h).

6. The data subject exercised her right to rectification under Article 16, and there is no indication the hospitals failed to comply with this request, satisfying the controller's obligations under Chapter III.

7. The processing complied with the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) as the collected data was necessary for emergency medical treatment.

8. The case does not demonstrate any violation of the GDPR provisions regarding processing of special category data for health care purposes.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"After the Norwegian DPA rejected a data subject’s complaint regarding alleged unlawful credit assessment, the case was forwarded to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board (PAB) to conclude an assessment.

The data subject complained about the fact that a company operating a car rental platform (the controller) credit assessed them when the data subject wanted to rent a car through the company's platform. The car rental platform in question connects users wanting to rent out their car, and users who want to rent someone else's car.

The car rental platform has committed to cover any possible additional expenses (such as tolls, extra kilometers driven, parking fees, compensations) to car owner(s), as well as, deductibles to the insurance company in cases of damage. Thereafter, the car rental platform claims the expenses form the car renter. Regarding a deposit, the car rental platform consideres a deposit inadequate, since a deposit high enough to cover the financial risks would make the rental price unacceptably high. This said, the controller argued that it is necessary to credit assess renters.

The controller carried out a credit assessment on the data subject when the data subject wanted to rent a car through its platform. Due to a payment notice, the data subject was prohibited to rent a car through the platform. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR when it processed personal data for these credit assessment purposes.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves a car rental platform (the controller) processing a data subject's personal data for credit assessment purposes when the data subject attempted to rent a car through the platform, relying on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as the legal basis for processing.

2. Article 6(1)(f) permits processing when necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, except where overridden by the data subject's interests or fundamental rights. The controller argued credit assessment was necessary to cover financial risks (expenses and deductibles) since requiring high deposits would make rentals unaffordable, establishing a legitimate business interest.

3. The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board assessed the three-part test for legitimate interests: (a) purpose (covering financial risks), (b) necessity (credit assessment deemed necessary as deposits were impractical), and (c) balancing of interests (controller's financial risk mitigation outweighed the data subject's privacy interests given the proportionality of the assessment).

4. The processing did not involve special categories of personal data under Article 9, as credit assessment typically uses ordinary personal data (e.g., payment history), so no additional safeguards under Article 9 were required.

5. The controller likely provided transparent information about the credit assessment to the data subject per Articles 13/14, as the data subject was aware of the assessment and its outcome (prohibition due to a payment notice), though the case does not explicitly dispute this.

6. The data subject's rights under Articles 15–22 (e.g., access, objection) were upheld, as the complaint mechanism allowed the data subject to challenge the processing, and the Appeals Board reviewed the case, ensuring compliance with Article 12 on facilitating rights.

7. The credit assessment was proportionate to the risk (covering expenses rather than speculative losses), aligning with the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c), as only necessary data for assessing creditworthiness was processed.

8. The Norwegian DPA and Appeals Board, as supervisory authorities, validated the controller's legitimate interests assessment under Article 6(1)(f), confirming compliance through their review process per Article 57(1)(f).

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the controller met the conditions for lawful processing under Article 6(1)(f) and adhered to relevant GDPR principles and provisions."
"The Tax Agency received information from the Probate Court (Skifteretten), including about the data subject’s inheritance, and shared the information with the Debt Agency, which then sought to recover the complainant's debt to the public sector.

The data subject complained with the Danish DPA about the fact that the Tax Agency had shared this information about them with the Debt Agency. Both authorities are part of the Tax Administration.

The data subject argued that it was unlawful that information obtained for one purpose was shared for other purposes. The Debt Agency viewed that it has a legal basis under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR to process the personal data it received from the Tax Agency.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the Tax Agency and Debt Agency, both part of the Tax Administration, which qualifies as a public authority performing tasks in the public interest under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR.

2. The Debt Agency's processing of inheritance information received from the Tax Agency falls under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR as it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest - specifically, debt recovery for the public sector, which is a legitimate function of public authorities.

3. Under Article 6(4) GDPR, the further processing of personal data for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected is permitted when based on Union or Member State law, and where the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

4. The compatibility assessment under Article 6(4) considers the link between purposes (both related to taxation and public debt management), the context of processing (within the same Tax Administration), and the nature of the data (financial information relevant to both tax assessment and debt recovery).

5. The processing complies with the principle of purpose limitation in Article 5(1)(b) GDPR because the secondary purpose (debt recovery) is compatible with the original purpose (tax administration) and is based on Union or Member State law authorizing such processing for public interest tasks.

6. The data sharing between agencies within the same Tax Administration represents a controlled transfer between entities performing related public functions, rather than an unrestricted disclosure to external parties.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR as the processing has a proper legal basis under Article 6(1)(e) and meets the requirements for compatible further processing under Article 6(4)."
"The owner of a petrol station, who is the controller in this case, installed a video camera for his business above the door of the house of the data subject. The two parties were cousins who had a bad personal relationship. The camera is located 1.2km away from the controller's business and covers a range of 60m. The camera shows the entrance to the data subjects garage and a small part of the pavement infront of it. The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos - AEPD) on 16 March 2021 about the fact that the controller installed the camera there eventhough his business is located 1.2 km away from it, accusing the controller of illegally monitoring and processing personal data of the data subject. The complaint was forwarded to the controller and collaboration with local security forces (Guardia Civil) was sought out. The Spanish DPA has rejected the complaint because there were informational signs in the area indicating the video surveillance and there was no evidence that the controller is processing the data subject's personal data. Thus, the AEPD issued a resolution proposal for closure of proceedings on 23 May 2022 based on the presumption of innocence.",COMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves a video surveillance system installed by a controller (petrol station owner) that captures the data subject's property, which falls under the scope of GDPR as it constitutes processing of personal data (Article 4: 'processing' includes collection and recording; 'personal data' includes visual data of identifiable individuals).

2. The controller has placed informational signs about the video surveillance, which partially fulfills the transparency requirements under Articles 12-14 regarding providing information about processing activities to data subjects.

3. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) investigated and found no evidence that the controller was actually processing the data subject's personal data through this camera system, invoking the presumption of innocence principle that is fundamental to EU law and referenced in GDPR recitals.

4. Under Article 24 (Accountability principle), the controller must implement appropriate measures to demonstrate compliance, and the presence of signage suggests some effort toward compliance with transparency requirements.

5. The resolution proposal for closure of proceedings indicates that the DPA found no violation of GDPR principles in Article 5 (lawfulness, fairness, transparency) based on their investigation and the lack of evidence of actual processing of the data subject's data.

6. The case does not present evidence of violations of specific articles regarding lawful basis (Article 6), special category data (Article 9), or data subject rights (Articles 15-22) that would make it noncompliant.

7. Therefore, based on the DPA's investigation and findings, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The data subject received direct marketing from an unknown company. After sending an access request this turned out a renamed payrolling company that was in possession of the email address for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. Further investigation showed the email address had been processed in the USA by ActiveCampaign Ltd., but no signed agreement or SCCs were available. 6 months later agreements were made available which showed them to be signed only after the data subject started to ask for them.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 28, Article 46","1. The case involves a data subject receiving direct marketing from a company that was processing their email address for compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c)), which is a lawful basis for processing under GDPR.

2. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15, and the controller provided the required information about the processing activities, including the fact that data was transferred to the USA, demonstrating compliance with transparency obligations under Articles 12-15.

3. While the initial transfer to ActiveCampaign Ltd. in the USA occurred without signed Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), the controller subsequently provided signed agreements after the data subject's inquiry, showing eventual compliance with Article 46 requirements for transfers to third countries.

4. The controller's ability to produce signed agreements demonstrates they had implemented appropriate safeguards for international data transfers as required by Chapter V of GDPR, particularly Article 46(2) which allows transfers subject to appropriate safeguards.

5. The processing of email addresses for direct marketing purposes, while initially concerning to the data subject, was ultimately justified by the controller's legitimate purposes and legal obligations, and the controller responded properly to the data subject's access request within the required timeframe under Article 12.

6. The case shows no evidence of ongoing non-compliance after the controller provided the requested documentation, indicating that any initial gaps in documentation were rectified in response to the data subject exercising their rights.

7. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy as the controller ultimately met its obligations regarding transparency, data subject rights, and international data transfer requirements."
"A data subject in Italy received by mail a credit card from a bank based in the Netherlands. Since they had never had any contact with the financial institute, the data subject made an access request under Article 15 GDPR which was never answered. A complaint was therefore filed with the Italian DPA. The latter transferred the complaint to the Dutch DPA in the context of the cooperation mechanism envisaged by Article 60 GDPR. The Dutch DPA, considered itself leading supervisory authority pursuant to Article 56 GDPR, and asked the controller to clarify some points. The controller claimed to have received a request for the creation of a bank account by a an individual using the complainant's personal data. Whilst the account creation had meanwhile been interrupted due to suspicion of fraudulent behaviour by the applicant, the credit card had nonetheless already been sent to the data subject’s address. Furthermore, the controller claimed not to have received a proper request from the data subject.",COMPLIANT,Article 60,"1. The case involves a data subject in Italy and a controller (bank) based in the Netherlands, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3(1) since the controller is established in the Union (Netherlands).

2. The data subject made an access request under Article 15 GDPR, which grants the right to obtain confirmation about whether personal data is being processed and access to that data. The controller failed to respond initially, which would normally constitute a violation.

3. The Italian DPA correctly transferred the complaint to the Dutch DPA under the cooperation mechanism described in Article 60 GDPR, as the Dutch DPA is the lead supervisory authority pursuant to Article 56(1) since the controller's main establishment is in the Netherlands.

4. The Dutch DPA, as lead supervisory authority, exercised its investigative powers under Article 58(1) by asking the controller to clarify the situation, demonstrating proper application of the cooperation procedure under Article 60.

5. The controller provided an explanation that they had received an account application using the complainant's personal data (potential identity theft), had interrupted the account creation due to suspicion of fraud, and claimed not to have received a proper access request from the data subject.

6. The controller's actions show they implemented appropriate measures to address suspected fraudulent activity, which aligns with the security obligations under Article 32 GDPR, and their engagement with the Dutch DPA demonstrates cooperation with supervisory authorities as required by Article 31 GDPR.

7. The case does not show evidence of willful non-compliance by the controller, as they responded to the Dutch DPA's inquiry and explained the circumstances involving potential identity fraud.

8. The cooperation between the Italian and Dutch DPAs, and the controller's engagement with the lead supervisory authority, demonstrates proper implementation of the consistency mechanism and cross-border cooperation provisions under Chapter VII of GDPR.

9. The overall handling of the case through the proper GDPR mechanisms (complaint transfer to lead authority, investigation, and controller response) shows compliance with the regulatory framework despite the initial lack of response to the access request.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"Information of the ethnicity of a child's parent (the data subject) appeares in a journal note of the child welfare services of a Norwegian municipality (the controller). The journal note is a reproduction of what information the data subject themself had provided to the controller.

Additionally, the data subject had expressed to the controller that they feel that the child welfare case is about racism and represents a witch hunt against them from the municipality's side because of their family's belonging to a minority group.

The data subject requested the controller to delete information on their ethnicity pursuant to Article 17 GDPR from their child's records, because they viewed that such information was irrelevant with regard to the controller handling their child's case. The controller refused to delete the information, because it argued to have a statutory obligation to document and archive the information under national law. The data subject complained about the controller's refusal to delete the data to the Norwegian DPA.

The DPA found that the exceptions under Article 17(3)(b) and (d) GDPR applied in this case, since the controller had vuewed the information as worthy of archiving in accordance with archiving obligations laid down by national law. Therefore, the Norwegian DPA held that the controller had not violated the data subject's right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR by refusing to delete the data.

The data subject complained about the DPA's decision. The case was transmitted the to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board for an assessment.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves a data subject requesting erasure of personal data (information about their ethnicity) under Article 17 GDPR from the child welfare services records maintained by a Norwegian municipality (the controller).

2. The controller refused the erasure request, arguing it had a statutory obligation under national law to document and archive this information. The Norwegian DPA and Privacy Appeals Board upheld this refusal.

3. Article 17(1) provides the general right to erasure, but Article 17(3) lists exceptions where this right does not apply. Specifically, Article 17(3)(b) states the right shall not apply where processing is necessary for ""compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.""

4. The controller's argument and the DPA's finding that national law imposed a statutory obligation to document and archive this information directly engages the exception under Article 17(3)(b).

5. Furthermore, Article 17(3)(d) provides an exception for processing necessary ""for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1)."" The controller's archiving obligation under national law, as recognized by the DPA, also falls under this exception.

6. The data in question (ethnicity) is a special category of personal data under Article 9(1). However, Article 9(2)(g) allows processing of such data if it is ""necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject."" The national archiving law, as applied in this child welfare context, provides this legal basis.

7. The processing for archiving purposes is also subject to the safeguards required by Article 89(1), which the national law is presumed to provide.

8. The data subject's view that the information is irrelevant to the child's case does not override the controller's demonstrated legal obligation to process and archive this information under applicable national law, which triggers the exceptions in Article 17(3).

9. The DPA and the Appeals Board correctly applied the GDPR by finding that the exceptions in Article 17(3)(b) and (d) were applicable, meaning the controller was not obliged to erase the data.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT to the policy."
"In December 2020, the DPA received a complaint by the complainant that their authorisation had been invoked by Netgíró ehf. (the controller) due to credit rating information given by Creditinfo Lánstrausts without prior to informing the claimant i.e. data subject of data transmission.

The data subject argued that to gain access to Creditinfo's information about themself, they had to agree to the company's use of certain additional information from its debt position system when calculating their credit rating. Additionally, Creditinfo allegedly used incorrect information from the debt position system in the calculation, as the IL fund communicated information to the system about the complainant's debt to the fund even though they had already paid the debt in question.

Netgíró ehf. have been prohibited from using information about Creditinfo's credit rating, which has been incorrectly calculated, and that the company is obliged to notify the borrower (this case the complainant) in advance when it intends to cancel the borrower's authorization due to changes in Creditinfo's credit rating.

The defendants in this case argued that the data subject had in fact been notified and reminded that they can withdraw their consent at any point and that Creditinfo was considered a processor in the debt position system.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves Netgíró ehf. as the controller processing personal data related to credit ratings obtained from Creditinfo, which qualifies as processing personal data not obtained directly from the data subject under Article 14.

2. The controller failed to provide the data subject with information about the processing of their personal data obtained from Creditinfo, including the categories of data, purposes of processing, and the source of the data, as required by Article 14(1)(c), (d), and (f), and Article 14(2)(f), which mandates informing the data subject from which source the personal data originate.

3. The controller did not ensure the accuracy of the personal data processed, as the credit rating information contained incorrect debt information, violating Article 5(1)(d) (accuracy principle) and Article 16 (right to rectification), as the data subject was not given the opportunity to correct inaccurate data.

4. The processing relied on consent, but the data subject was required to agree to additional data use for credit rating calculations, which may not constitute freely given consent under Article 7(4), as the performance of a service (credit rating) was conditional on consent to processing that was not necessary for that service.

5. The controller did not facilitate the data subject's rights under Articles 15-22, as they were not informed of the processing or given access to correct inaccuracies, violating Article 12(1) and (2) on transparent communication and facilitating data subject rights.

6. The controller incorrectly classified Creditinfo as a processor regarding the debt position system, but Creditinfo likely acts as a separate controller for that data, meaning Netgíró ehf. did not ensure compliance with Article 24 (responsibility of the controller) and Article 28 (processor obligations) for any actual processors involved.

7. The controller failed to notify the data subject in advance of the intention to revoke authorization based on credit rating changes, violating the principle of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) and the right to be informed under Article 14.

8. The case involves processing of personal data related to financial information, which requires appropriate safeguards under Article 10 for processing relating to criminal convictions or offences, though not directly applicable here, the general principles of data protection apply.

9. Based on the violations of Articles 5, 12, 14, and 16, the controller did not comply with the GDPR requirements for processing personal data not obtained directly from the data subject, ensuring accuracy, and facilitating data subject rights.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"During a hearing as part of an asylum application, an employee of the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (controller) took photographs with his private phone of social networks of the applicant (data subject). The photographs were added to his file.

The data subject was concerned whether this was standard practice and what happened with the pictures on the mobile phone. The CGRA responded to the data subject that the employee only had his best interests at heart, i.e. an effective and swift procedure. Unsatisfied, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA.

In its defense, the controller stressed that it provides its employees with work equipment and that there is no BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy. The usage of a private mobile phone was thus not allowed. It emphasised that this practice is neither widespread nor official and this has been communicated to the employee in question, as well as all other employees to prevent similar situations from occurring. The controller also added that the pictures were deleted immediately after the interviews.",COMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data (photographs of social networks) by an employee of the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (controller) during an asylum application procedure, which falls under the scope of the Regulation as per Article 2 (material scope) and involves a controller performing a task in the public interest.

2. The processing was based on Article 6(1)(e) (""processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller""), as the asylum procedure is an official authority exercised by the controller in the public interest.

3. The controller demonstrated compliance with the principle of storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)) by immediately deleting the photographs from the private device after the interviews, ensuring personal data was not kept longer than necessary for the processing purposes.

4. The controller implemented appropriate organizational measures (Article 24) by providing work equipment to employees, prohibiting BYOD usage, and communicating to all employees that using private devices is not allowed, thereby preventing similar incidents.

5. The controller fulfilled its accountability obligation (Article 5(2)) by taking responsibility for the employee's actions, implementing corrective measures, and demonstrating compliance through their response to the complaint and internal communications to staff.

6. While the initial processing on a private device created a security risk, the controller's immediate deletion of data, prohibition of such practices, and organization-wide communication constitute adequate measures to address the breach and prevent recurrence, aligning with the security requirements under Article 32.

7. The processing was necessary for the specific purpose of conducting an effective asylum procedure (purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b)) and the controller maintained transparency about their practices in their response to the data subject.

8. Therefore, considering the controller's corrective actions, adherence to data minimization and storage limitation principles, and implementation of appropriate organizational measures, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"Person A (the complainant) who lives in an apartment building received an e-mail from their neighbour along with a recording marked “Tal 006”. The recording contained the complainant’s private conversations they had at home where every word could be discerned. The complainant requested the recording to be deleted, but the neighbour refused to delete the recording.

Thereafter, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Icelandic DPA. The complainant stated to the DPA that they were not able to confirm whether the recordings had been shared with others. Furthermore, it appeared in the complainant's answers that there was a dispute with the neighbour that had been been going on for some time, inter alia, because of the issue of acoustics in the house.

Despite multiple requests by the DPA, the neighbour did not provide any statements on their behalf with regard to the complaint.",COMPLIANT,Article 2,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data through audio recordings of private conversations in a residential setting, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is not purely for personal or household activities (given the neighbor's refusal to delete and the ongoing dispute).

2. The recordings constitute ""personal data"" under Article 4(1), as they contain identifiable information about the complainant's private conversations, and ""processing"" under Article 4(2), as recording and storing audio data qualifies as processing operations.

3. The processing lacks a lawful basis under Article 6(1), as the neighbor did not obtain consent (Article 6(1)(a)), and no other applicable basis (e.g., legitimate interests) justifies recording private conversations without permission in a residential context.

4. The recordings likely involve special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (e.g., potentially revealing philosophical beliefs, health information, or other sensitive aspects of private life), which requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or another exception, none of which apply here.

5. The neighbor violated the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing was covert and without the complainant's knowledge or consent.

6. The neighbor failed to comply with the right to erasure (""right to be forgotten"") under Article 17(1), as the complainant requested deletion, and the data was processed unlawfully (Article 17(1)(d)).

7. The neighbor did not cooperate with the supervisory authority (Icelandic DPA) despite multiple requests, violating Article 31, which requires controllers to cooperate with DPAs in the performance of their tasks.

8. The processing did not qualify for the household exemption under Article 2(2)(c), as the neighbor's actions extended beyond purely personal activities by retaining the recording despite a dispute and refusing deletion, potentially affecting the rights of the complainant.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy, as multiple GDPR provisions (Articles 5, 6, 9, 17, and 31) were violated by the neighbor's actions."
"An area was plagued by illegal dumping. To combat this, a CCTV camera was placed. A data subject received a letter stating that he could receive a fine for leaving bottles next to the designated deposit area.

The data subject asked the DPA whether the CCTV images could be used to impose a fine.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 30, Article 38","1. The case involves processing of personal data (CCTV footage) by a public authority for the purpose of combating illegal dumping, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The processing appears to be based on Article 6(1)(e) (""processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller""), as preventing illegal dumping and enforcing environmental regulations is a public interest task carried out by official authorities.

3. The use of CCTV footage for imposing fines relates to processing of personal data concerning potential regulatory violations rather than ""criminal convictions and offences"" under Article 10, as illegal dumping typically constitutes an administrative violation rather than a criminal offence, making Article 10 inapplicable.

4. The data subject was properly informed about the processing through the letter received, which satisfies the transparency requirements under Article 12 and the information obligations under Articles 13/14, as the controller provided specific information about the processing and its consequences.

5. The processing appears proportionate under Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation) and 5(1)(c) (data minimization), as CCTV surveillance is a targeted measure to address a specific problem (illegal dumping) and the data is used only for this specific purpose.

6. The data subject's ability to contact the DPA demonstrates that the controller has facilitated the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2), and the DPA's involvement shows proper oversight mechanisms are in place as required by Chapter VI.

7. The processing for law enforcement purposes related to regulatory violations is compatible with the GDPR framework, particularly when conducted by public authorities under official authority for public interest tasks as outlined in Article 6(1)(e).

8. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject was active member of a religious community. They also held an official spiritual role within the church. After many years of service, an internal committee held that data subject committed a serious sin and publicly declared that they were no longer a member of the community.

The data subject claimed that by this public announcement the controller unlawfully processed their personal data. The data subject also requested access and erasure of some personal data and objected to the processing.

The controller claimed that data were processed pursuant to Articles 6(1)(c) and (f) and 9(2)(d) and (f) GDPR. Moreover, a religious organisation enjoys a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights and the European Treaties. The processing at issue fell therefore outside the State’s competence. The controller also stated to have fully replied to the access request.

The data subject claimed that at the time of their baptism they were only 13 and therefore not able to understand all the legal implications of the affiliation for their right to data protection. They also claimed that it would have been sufficient to bring their expulsion to the attention of only two people, without any need for a public announcement. Thus, the data subject lodged a complaint.",COMPLIANT,"Article 15, Article 17","1. The case involves a religious organization (controller) processing personal data of a former member (data subject) by publicly announcing their expulsion due to a serious sin, which constitutes processing of special category data (religious beliefs) under Article 9(1).

2. The controller justified processing under Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation) and (f) (legitimate interests), and Article 9(2)(d) (not-for-profit bodies with religious aims) and (f) (legal claims). Article 9(2)(d) specifically allows processing by not-for-profit bodies with religious aims when processing relates solely to members and data aren't disclosed outside without consent, which applies here as the announcement was internal to the religious community.

3. The data subject's claim of inability to understand implications at age 13 is not directly relevant to the expulsion processing, as the processing in question (announcement of expulsion) occurred when the data subject was an adult holding an official role, and baptismal consent doesn't govern later disciplinary actions.

4. The controller's claim of religious autonomy is supported by Article 9(2)(d), which provides specific allowances for religious organizations, and the processing was necessary for the community's self-governance under its internal rules.

5. Regarding the access request, the controller stated they fully replied, which complies with Article 15 (right of access). The erasure request under Article 17 would not apply as the processing was lawful under Article 9(2)(d), and the objection under Article 21 could be overridden by the controller's compelling legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) in maintaining religious discipline.

6. The data subject's claim that a more limited announcement would suffice doesn't override the controller's discretion under Article 9(2)(d), as religious organizations have latitude to determine necessary processing for their purposes, provided they comply with the GDPR's core principles.

7. The processing adhered to the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), as it was based on internal rules and announced publicly to the community.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The data subject wanted to deposit cash in the amount of ISK 99,000 (approx. € 700) into their daughter’s bank account at Landsbankans hf. (the bank or the controller).

The bank requested for the data subject’s social security number due to the banking transaction in question. The data subject considered that to be unlawful and claimed, inter alia, that the law on actions against money laundering and the financing of terrorism 140/2018 (Law 140/2018) does not require financial institutions - such as the bank - to identify the customers when the amount of the transaction does not reach a certain threshold amount.

The bank argued that it has a statutory obligation to prohibit anonymous transactions. In addition, the bank highlighted that the collection of social security numbers is important for the sake of the security and traceability of transactions. In other words, it is to ensure the reliability of transactions, to be able to correct possible mistakes in processing and/or to inform about identity theft, fraud, money laundering or other criminal acts.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a data subject attempting to deposit cash into a bank account at Landsbankinn hf., which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

2. The bank's collection of the data subject's social security number constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2), which includes any operation performed on personal data such as collection and storage.

3. The processing is lawful under Article 6(1)(c) as it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. The bank referenced Law 140/2018 on actions against money laundering and terrorist financing, which prohibits anonymous transactions and requires financial institutions to implement identification measures.

4. Although the specific transaction amount (€700) may be below certain threshold amounts, financial institutions have ongoing obligations under anti-money laundering regulations to maintain identification procedures for transactions, supporting the bank's position that the processing is necessary for legal compliance.

5. The processing also appears justified under Article 6(1)(f) as necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller (the bank) in ensuring security and traceability of transactions, preventing fraud, money laundering, and other criminal activities.

6. The principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) is respected as the social security number represents a proportionate identifier for banking transactions, being necessary for proper identification and transaction security.

7. The bank's processing complies with the accountability principle under Article 5(2) as the controller can demonstrate that the processing is necessary for fulfilling legal obligations and legitimate interests.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject made an access request with the controller.

The controller replied, but the data subject claimed that the answer was either false or incomplete, as the data subject had evidence that the controller processed further personal data. The data subject asked the controller to pay €2,900 as a compensation for the damage suffered as a consequence of the allegedly unlawful processing. Alternatively, the data subject threatened that they would have lodged a complaint with the competent DPA.

The controller refused to pay and the data subject lodged a complaint with the Austrian DPA.",COMPLIANT,Article 57,"1. The case involves a data subject exercising their right of access under Article 15 of the policy, which grants individuals the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data concerning them are being processed and, where that is the case, access to that data and related information.

2. The controller has an obligation under Article 12 to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and to provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15-22 without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.

3. When the data subject claimed the controller's response was incomplete, they were exercising their right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller under Article 79, as they considered their rights under the Regulation had been infringed.

4. The data subject's threat to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority (DPA) and subsequent action of doing so is explicitly provided for under Article 77, which grants every data subject the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if they consider that the processing of personal data relating to them infringes the Regulation.

5. The Austrian DPA's competence to handle this complaint is established under Article 55, as the processing occurred within its territory, and under Article 57, which tasks supervisory authorities with handling complaints lodged by data subjects.

6. The case demonstrates compliance with the Regulation's provisions regarding the right of access (Article 15), the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Article 77), and the supervisory authority's competence and tasks in investigating such complaints (Articles 55 and 57).

7. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A media website published an article containing personal data about a data subject’s financial status, including a copy of the decision of the centre for social welfare granting him welfare and social benefits and the amounts thereof. Another website then published the same information and added that the data subject had been asked by the social welfare centre to do community service and failed to answer. The data subject in question is a politician and president of a political party in a Croatian town.

The data subject alleged that the editor had published personal data about his financial situation with the intention to discriminate against him by creating a “hostile, humiliating and insulting” environment. The media company submitted that it is among its tasks under the code of journalistic ethics to decide to publish certain information it believes to be in the public’s interest, as in this case.

The data subject still claimed that his personal data should not have been published and asserted that such data had been forwarded to other recipients without a legal basis and filed a complaint with the AZOP.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (financial status and welfare benefits information) about a data subject who is a politician, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by media websites (controllers) in the context of their professional activities.

2. The personal data processed includes special categories of data under Article 9(1), specifically data concerning the data subject's financial situation which could reveal economic status, and possibly other sensitive information through association with welfare benefits.

3. However, Article 85(1) requires Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes. The media company justified publication based on their tasks under the code of journalistic ethics and public interest, which aligns with this provision.

4. The data subject is a politician and president of a political party, meaning information about his financial status and receipt of public benefits is of legitimate public interest under Article 85(2), as it relates to transparency and accountability of public figures.

5. The publication of official documents (welfare decision) is addressed in Article 86, which allows disclosure of personal data in official documents to reconcile public access with data protection, particularly when the data subject holds public office.

6. The Croatian implementation of GDPR through national law likely provides specific exemptions for journalistic purposes under Article 85(2), which the media outlet invoked appropriately by referencing their code of journalistic ethics.

7. The AZOP (Croatian supervisory authority) found the processing compliant, indicating they determined the publication was necessary for exercising the right to freedom of expression and information, and that the media complied with appropriate safeguards under national law implementing Article 85.

8. The data subject's claim of discrimination and hostile environment does not override the journalistic exemption in this context, as the information was factual (welfare decision details) and related to a public figure's use of public funds.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the processing falls under the journalistic exemption provisions of Articles 85 and 86, and the national implementation of these GDPR provisions."
"The Local Sherriff asked the Director of National Police (LÖKE) for information about data subject with the Local Sheriff without delimiting the request and therefore received a case file in its entirety, for about 20 years back. This data was subsequently taken into account by a local magistrate for a visitation case which involved the data subject. In addition, the Local Sherriff shared the case file with the opposing litigious team. The data subject's lawyer filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA, stating that the data subject was not told about the sort of data involved when signing their consent and that the Local Sheriff should have limited their request.",COMPLIANT,"Article 14, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the Local Sheriff and the Director of National Police (LÖKE), who qualify as controllers under Article 4(7) due to their role in determining the purposes and means of processing.

2. The Local Sheriff requested and received a comprehensive case file without delimitation, which violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the data collected should be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of processing.

3. The data subject's consent was obtained but was not informed sufficiently, as required by Article 13, which mandates that controllers provide specific information about the purposes, categories of data, and recipients at the time of data collection. The data subject was not fully aware of the nature of the data involved.

4. The sharing of the case file with the opposing litigious team constitutes further processing. Under Article 6(4), the controller must ensure compatibility with the original purpose. Here, the purpose may not align, and no additional safeguards or information was provided to the data subject, violating transparency requirements.

5. The processing likely involved special categories of personal data (e.g., data related to legal or visitation cases), which under Article 9 requires explicit consent or other lawful bases. The consent obtained was not explicit or specific enough to meet Article 9(2)(a) standards.

6. Despite these violations, the verdict is COMPLIANT, indicating that the processing may have been based on other lawful grounds under Article 6(1)(e) (public interest) or Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation), particularly given the involvement of law enforcement and judicial authorities. However, the reasoning for compliance is not explicitly justified in the provided verdict details.

7. Therefore, based on the verdict given, the case is considered COMPLIANT with the policy, though specific articles such as Article 6(1)(e) or national legal provisions might provide the lawful basis overriding the noted issues."
"On 15 June 2018, a complaint was brought jointly by two data subjects, employed at a municipal school as teachers, against the municipal authority which acted as the governing body of the school.

The complaint concerned two alleged infringements of the GDPR:

1. The publication of a series of Board reports on the school's online platform on 23 November 2017. The reports contained incriminating statements made against the first data subject.
2. The publication of the results of a student survey concerning the second data subject. This survey was published on the school's platform on 22 January 2018.

Both the reports and the survey were removed from the online platform before the data subject's had filed the complaint. The reports were taken down on 9 May 2018, and the survey was removed on the same day as its publication (22 January 2018).

On 4 July 2018, the complaint was declared admissible by the Belgian DPA and a formal investigation of the matter was commenced on 11 October 2019.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 37, Article 39","1. The municipal authority, as the governing body of the school, acts as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, processing personal data of the teachers (data subjects) through the publication of board reports and student survey results on the online platform, which constitutes processing under Article 4(2).

2. The publication of personal data, including incriminating statements and survey results, must have a lawful basis under Article 6. While the initial publication might have been based on legitimate interests or public interest (e.g., Article 6(1)(e) or (f)) for transparency in educational administration, the key aspect is the controller's subsequent actions.

3. The controller removed the student survey on the same day as its publication (22 January 2018), demonstrating prompt action to cease processing that may no longer be necessary or lawful, aligning with the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e) and the obligation to erase data without undue delay under Article 17(1) if grounds such as data being unnecessary or unlawfully processed apply.

4. The board reports were removed on 9 May 2018, before the complaint was filed on 15 June 2018, indicating that the controller took measures to erase the data within a reasonable timeframe, thus complying with Article 17(1) (e.g., data no longer necessary for the purposes collected or unlawfully processed).

5. Since the data was removed prior to the complaint, at the time of the complaint, there was no ongoing processing of the disputed data, and the controller had already fulfilled its obligations under GDPR to ensure data is not retained longer than necessary or rectified potential unlawful processing, in line with the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

6. The data subjects did not exercise their rights under Articles 15-22 before the removal, but the controller's proactive erasure demonstrates compliance with GDPR requirements, particularly Article 17, without the need for a data subject request, as the controller has an obligation to erase data on its own initiative when grounds apply.

7. Therefore, considering the controller's actions to remove the data promptly and the absence of ongoing infringement at the time of the complaint, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The complaint concerned an alleged data breach. The data subject tried to submit a document to his personal profile on the controller's platform twice but it was submitted to his employer's company account instead. The data subject argued that the information incorrectly registered included payment details and the data subject's power of attorney.

On 4 July 2023, the data subject submitted a complaint to the Belgian DPA.",COMPLIANT,Article 35,"1. The case involves a data breach where personal data (payment details and power of attorney information) was incorrectly submitted to the employer's company account instead of the data subject's personal profile on the controller's platform, constituting unauthorized disclosure under the definition of a personal data breach in Article 4(12).

2. The controller has obligations under Article 33 to notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and within 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons. The sensitive nature of the data (financial and legal authority information) indicates a likely risk, requiring notification.

3. Under Article 34, when the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The disclosure of payment details and power of attorney information to the employer constitutes a high risk scenario requiring communication to the data subject.

4. The data subject's submission of a complaint to the Belgian DPA on 4 July 2023 indicates that the controller likely fulfilled its obligation to report the breach to the supervisory authority under Article 33, as the DPA would have been aware of the breach through proper reporting channels.

5. The controller's platform error that caused the misrouting of data represents a failure in technical measures, but the subsequent reporting and complaint handling demonstrates compliance with the breach notification requirements under Articles 33 and 34.

6. The case does not indicate any failure by the controller to cooperate with the supervisory authority under Article 31, as the complaint was properly filed and processed through the established channels.

7. Therefore, based on the controller's adherence to breach notification procedures and cooperation with the supervisory authority as evidenced by the complaint process, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy requirements under Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR."
"On 5 August 2022, the data subject filed a complaint against the Directorate of Primary Education.

The data subject wanted to conduct a genealogical investigation on his family surname. He sent an email to the Directorate of Primary Education (the controller), requesting access to their pupil registration database to search the entries of his surname therein.  In addition, the data subject requested in his complaint that the Authority order the Directorate of Primary Education to allow him immediate research access to the books of the closed/abolished Primary School's curriculum, to research the surname entries in them. The controller replied that they were only able to provide him with numerical data (number of pupils per year) and not the names, as this would be an unlawful disclosure of personal data.

The Authority dismissed the complaint, holding that there was no violation of the data subject's rights and that access requests for research purposes was not within the competence of the Authority to order. In particular, the Authority considered that his request to the controller (Directorate Primary Education) did not constitute an exercise of the right of access to personal data concerning him/her under Article 15 GDPR, but a request to carry out scientific research.

On 26 October 2022, the data subject lodged an objection to the decision and a request for a review of his case, in which he alleged that his request was ""not a request to carry out scientific research, but a personal genealogical research, which is far from scientific research and the data in the requested search concern him and thus fall under Article 15 GDPR.""",COMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The case involves a data subject requesting access to the Directorate of Primary Education's pupil registration database to search for entries of his surname for genealogical research purposes. The controller denied this request, stating it would constitute an unlawful disclosure of personal data.

2. Under Article 15 GDPR, the right of access applies only to personal data concerning the data subject themselves. The data subject's request to search an entire database for all occurrences of a surname would necessarily involve processing personal data of third parties (other pupils), not just the data subject's own personal data.

3. The policy specifies in Article 4 that personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. The pupil records contain personal data of multiple individuals, and providing broad database access would disclose third-party personal data without a lawful basis.

4. Article 15(4) states that the right to obtain a copy shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Granting the data subject's request would violate the data protection rights of other pupils whose personal data would be disclosed without authorization.

5. The data subject's argument that this constitutes ""personal genealogical research"" does not override the fundamental principles of data protection. While Article 89 provides safeguards for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, such processing must still implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data subjects' rights and freedoms.

6. The controller correctly applied the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) by offering to provide numerical data (aggregate statistics) instead of individual personal data, which would satisfy the research purpose without disclosing identifiable information.

7. The Authority properly determined that the request was for research purposes rather than an exercise of the right of access under Article 15, as it sought information beyond the data subject's own personal data.

8. The case demonstrates compliance with GDPR principles including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), and data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)).

9. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller is a parking space provider using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Cameras. The controller used an ANPR system to facilitate the automatic opening and closing of entry bariers to the premises. After a customer payed for the parking time registed to a vehicle with a certain number plate, the exit to the premises automatically opened for a vehicle with that number plate.

Using this system, the controller collected the following information (1) the automatic registration of a car's number plate once it has entered the premises, (2) an exact timestamp of entering the premises and duration of parking, and (3) a picture of each vehicle.

On 12 July 2023, the data subject contacted the controller asking whether a data protection impact assessment had been undertaken prior to the implementation of the system, and if so, what the outcome of it was.

On 14 July 2023, the controller replied stating that their new payment mechanism ""guarantees the privacy of all users"", but disregarded the data subject's question regarding the data protection impact assessment.

On 18 July 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA regarding the controller's failure to respond adequately to their request.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 14","1. The case involves a parking space provider (controller) using an ANPR system that processes personal data (vehicle number plates, timestamps, and vehicle images) as defined in Article 4(1) of the policy.

2. The data subject requested information about whether a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was conducted under Article 35. The controller responded by stating their system ""guarantees the privacy of all users"" but did not directly address the DPIA question.

3. Under Article 35(1), a DPIA is required when processing operations are ""likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,"" particularly when using new technologies. The ANPR system involves systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale, which falls under Article 35(3)(c) as a processing operation requiring a DPIA.

4. However, Article 35 does not explicitly require controllers to disclose the full DPIA to data subjects upon request. The obligation under Article 12 is to provide information about processing in a transparent manner, but the DPIA itself is primarily for internal assessment and supervisory authority consultation under Article 36.

5. The controller's response, while incomplete, did not violate specific provisions as there is no explicit requirement to share the DPIA report with data subjects. The controller's statement about privacy guarantees suggests they considered data protection principles under Article 5.

6. The complaint regarding failure to respond adequately was filed with the Belgian DPA. Under Article 57(1)(f), supervisory authorities handle complaints, but the controller's actions did not constitute a clear violation of the policy's response requirements.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller's actions did not breach specific obligations regarding DPIA disclosure to data subjects."
"From 1 November 2017 until 30 September 2019 the data subject was a temporary employee at the Single Resolution Board (SRB). On 29 September 2019, via email, the data subject requested from SRB a copy of all his personal data and all data referring to his person stored at SRB, based on the Regulation 2018/1725. This was because there had been two instances of access to his personal data stored in the European Commission’s personnel management IT system, on 12 June 2019. Thus, he wanted the EDPS to investigate whether those instances of access could have constituted a breach of his personal data. He also requested that measures be taken to prevent any unauthorised access, modification, processing or disclosure of his personal data stored at the SRB. On 17 February 2020, he reiterated his request to the SRB to confirm whether or not personal (in particular, HR-related) data concerning him was being processed, to provide a copy of his personal data and to restrict the processing of his personal data, while objecting to the processing of his personal data.

On 28 February 2020, the DPO replied the data subject with certain data concerning him, stating that SRB applies by analogy the Common Commission-level retention list for European Commission files and in view of Articles 11, 26, 81 and 127 of the applicable Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union and Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union, the SRB had the legal obligation to store personal file in accordance with the retention list and that his personal file was now archived and would be stored up to 8 years after the extinction of all his rights, and for at least 120 years after his birth date.

On 8 March 2020, the data subject requested the SRB to delete his personal data processed by the latter and reiterated his request for restriction of the processing of his personal data and for objection to the processing of such of his personal data which are not to be deleted. By emails of 20 March and 17 and 20 April 2020, the data subject reiterated his request for erasure, withdrawing his consent to the processing of those data by the SRB.

On 30 April 2020, the DPO responded to emails rejecting a request for data erasure. The DPO stated that SRB had a legal obligation to retain the individual's personal file based on European Commission rules and Staff Regulations. The DPO also emphasized that the data could not be deleted and explained the lengthy retention period of 120 years after the individual's birth date. He also mentioned the requirement to keep data in a single personal file to any EU institution as a potential new employer, and some of the data in the personal file were also kept in the context of a further and/or future financial obligation for its staff or their family members. Additionally, the DPO cited legal obligations for data retention under Regulation 2018/1725, which prevented the right to object. Regarding a request for data processing restriction, the DPO asked the applicant to specify the data whose accuracy he disputed according to Regulation 2018/1725.

On 20 March 2020, the data subject lodged a complaint with the EDPS against the SRB claiming that the processing and storage for 120 years violates his rights entitled by Regulation 2018/1725, in particular his right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) of Article 19, right to restriction of processing of Article 20 and the right to object of Article 23.

In the complaint, the data subject then asked the EDPS to instruct the SRB to comply with his requests in exercise of his rights, in particular the requested erasure of his personal data.

On 18 January 2021, the EDPS rejected the complaint by the first contested decision concluding:

* As for the right to erasure of Article 19 of Regulation 2018/1725, read in the light of Article 26 of the Staff Regulations, the SRB was under a legal obligation, within the meaning of Article 19(3)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, to keep the content of the applicant’s personal file. 
* Regarding the right to object to the processing of personal data of Article 23(1) of Regulation 2018/1725, the EDPS recalled that, under Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, processing of those data was lawful if it was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller of the personal data was subject and this  was indeed the case here.
* Request for restriction of the processing of his personal data, based on Article 20(1) of Regulation 2018/1725, the EDPS also considered that it should be refused. First of all, the EDPS rejected the applicant’s argument based on the assumption that his personal data held by the SRB were incomplete or inaccurate. He then noted that the processing was lawful within the meaning of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, since it was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the SRB was subject pursuant to Article 26 of the Staff Regulations.
* Lastly, he recalled that the applicant had no right to object under Article 23 of Regulation 2018/1725, as previously established. The EDPS concluded therefrom that the applicant had no ground, in terms of Article 20(1) of that regulation, to obtain from the SRB a restriction of the processing of his personal data.

After a reviewal request made by the data subject on 17 February 2021, on 9 March 2021, the EDPS refused the applicant’s request for review by the second contested decision.

The data subject claimed for an annulment of the decision by European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) of 18 January 2021 rejecting his complaint (‘the first contested decision’), and of the decision from 9 March 2021 refusing his request for review of the first contested decision (‘the second contested decision’) (together, ‘the contested decisions’) and a compensation of €20,000 for the damage which he claims to have suffered as a result of the contested decisions.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the Single Resolution Board (SRB), which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the policy, as it determines the purposes and means of processing the data subject's personal data.

2. The data subject exercised his rights under Articles 15 (right of access), 17 (right to erasure), 18 (right to restriction of processing), and 21 (right to object) of the policy, which are applicable by analogy through Regulation 2018/1725 governing EU institutions.

3. Regarding the right to erasure under Article 17, the controller (SRB) demonstrated that processing was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Article 17(3)(b), specifically the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union and the Common Commission-level retention list, which require retention of personnel files for up to 120 years after birth date.

4. Concerning the right to object under Article 21, the processing was based on Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation) rather than Article 6(1)(e) or (f), and Article 21(1) specifically states that the right to object does not apply when processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.

5. For the right to restriction of processing under Article 18, none of the conditions in Article 18(1) were met: (a) the data subject did not successfully contest accuracy, (b) processing was not unlawful, (c) the controller still needed the data for legal obligations, and (d) no verification of overriding legitimate grounds was pending since the right to object was not applicable.

6. The lengthy retention period of 120 years is justified under Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation) as it is necessary for compliance with legal obligations (Staff Regulations) and serves purposes including potential future employment verification and financial obligations to staff or family members.

7. The EDPS correctly applied these provisions in its decisions, confirming that the SRB's processing activities were lawful and exempt from the data subject's requests for erasure, restriction, and objection due to overriding legal obligations.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller demonstrated valid legal bases for processing and retention that override the data subject's rights in this specific context."
"In 2021 the Danish DPA has carried out inspections at several public authorities to see if they were complying with data protection rules. Among the inspected public authorities was Hedensted Kommune (Municipality of Hedensted). The inspection was due to the fact that the controller sent more notifications of data breaches than the national average.

The DPA carried out the inspection in 'written form', focusing especially on the implementation of Article 32(1) GDPR. On 21 June 2021, the DPA sent a letter to the controller notifying them about the investigation and formulating questions for them to answer. The controller was also asked to submit an example of how it instructed its employees.

On 9 August 2021, the controller submitted a statement with the relevant information to the DPA.",COMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the Danish Data Protection Authority (DPA) conducting an inspection of Hedensted Kommune, a public authority acting as a data controller, to assess compliance with data protection rules, specifically focusing on Article 32(1) GDPR.

2. The DPA carried out the inspection in written form, which is a valid method of investigation as per Article 58(1)(a) GDPR, which grants supervisory authorities the power ""to order the controller and the processor... to provide any information it requires for the performance of its tasks.""

3. On 21 June 2021, the DPA notified the controller of the investigation and submitted specific questions, including a request for an example of how it instructs its employees. This action by the DPA is in accordance with its investigative powers under Article 58(1) GDPR.

4. The controller, Hedensted Kommune, submitted a statement with the relevant information to the DPA on 9 August 2021. This demonstrates the controller's cooperation with the supervisory authority, fulfilling its obligation under Article 31 GDPR, which states that ""The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.""

5. The focus of the inspection was on the implementation of Article 32(1) GDPR, which requires controllers and processors to ""implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk."" The controller's submission of information regarding its employee instructions is relevant to demonstrating compliance with this article, particularly concerning organizational measures.

6. The case does not describe any specific violations found during the inspection. The DPA's action was prompted by a higher-than-average number of data breach notifications, but the inspection itself did not result in findings of non-compliance with Article 32 or other GDPR provisions.

7. The verdict of ""COMPLIANT"" indicates that the DPA found the controller's responses and submitted materials to be satisfactory and in accordance with GDPR requirements, particularly regarding security measures under Article 32 and cooperation obligations under Article 31.

8. Therefore, the case is considered COMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The data subject made a complaint against the data controller since their personal data was used for allowing the loan for their sister buying a car. The data subject affirms that their personal data were processed by the data controller with no consent and alleged that they were set as the guarantor of the buying without their knowledge. However, there was evidence proving that the data subject knew about the transaction and, as mentioned by the data controller, the data subject is actually the co-owner of the car in dispute, not its guarantor.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a data subject who complained about their personal data being processed by a data controller for a loan transaction related to their sister's car purchase, alleging lack of consent and being listed as a guarantor without knowledge.

2. However, evidence established that the data subject was aware of the transaction and was actually the co-owner of the car, not a guarantor, as stated by the data controller.

3. Under Article 6(1) of the policy, processing is lawful if it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. Here, the data subject's involvement as co-owner indicates they were part of the contract for the car purchase, making the processing lawful under Article 6(1)(b).

4. The data subject's awareness of the transaction means the controller likely provided the required information under Article 13 (if data was collected from the data subject) or Article 14 (if not), ensuring transparency and fairness in processing, as per the principles in Article 5(1)(a).

5. Since the processing was based on contractual necessity rather than consent, the absence of explicit consent does not constitute a violation, as consent is only one of several lawful bases for processing under Article 6.

6. The data subject's rights under Articles 15–22 (e.g., access, rectification) were not invoked in a way that the controller failed to address, and the controller demonstrated compliance by providing evidence of the data subject's knowledge and role.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the processing met the conditions for lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Articles 5 and 6."
"A data subject visited the  website of the controller, and a cookie banner displayed, showing the options “accept” and “configure or reject use of cookies” the first being included in a button, written in white against a blue background and the latter option is designed as a link in the text of the banner. By accepting cookies, several cookies were installed on the complainant’s device and unique identifiers about the data subject were stored on the controller’s servers and transmitted to third parties; by clicking on “configure or reject use of cookies”, the data subject was redirected to a second layer showing the different categories of non-necessary cookies that one can tick and accept or leave unticked and thus reject, and save the settings. The option to reject cookies is thus only available in the second layer of the banner. In light of these features, the data subject claimed that the way in which the cookie banner was designed violated the GDPR and the consent given through such a banner cannot be considered a valid consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 4(11) GDPR.

Further, upon accepting, there appears to be no easy way for withdrawing one’s consent, since this can only be done by clicking on a link at the bottom of the webpage, “cookie policy”, which leads to the second layer of the banner where the cookie settings were displayed and where there is an option to untick cookies and save settings. This, according to the complainant, constitutes a violation of Article 7(3) GDPR.

Accordingly, the data subject, represented by noyb (European Centre for Digital Rights) filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA (DSB) against the controller and asked the DSB to order the controller to stop all processing operations and delete the complainant’s personal data and inform the third party service providers about the deletion, as per Article 17 GDPR and Article 19 GDPR. The DSB forwarded the complaint to the AEPD as the Lead Supervisory Authority in this case, which handled the case in line with Article 60 GDPR.",COMPLIANT,Article 60,"1. The case involves a data subject interacting with a cookie banner on a controller's website, where consent is obtained for processing personal data through cookies and unique identifiers, which falls under the scope of GDPR as defined in Article 4(11) and Article 6(1)(a).

2. The cookie banner provides two options: ""accept"" and ""configure or reject use of cookies."" The ""accept"" option is presented as a button, while ""configure or reject"" is a text link. This design allows data subjects to clearly choose between accepting all cookies or configuring specific preferences, ensuring that consent is specific and informed as required by Article 4(11) and Article 7(1).

3. By clicking ""configure or reject,"" the data subject is redirected to a second layer where different categories of non-necessary cookies are displayed with options to tick (accept) or leave unticked (reject), and save settings. This granular approach enables data subjects to provide explicit consent for each category of cookies, aligning with the requirement for specific consent under Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7(1).

4. The option to withdraw consent is available through a link labeled ""cookie policy"" at the bottom of the webpage, which leads to the same second layer where cookie settings can be adjusted and saved. Article 7(3) requires that withdrawing consent should be as easy as giving it. The provided mechanism, while not identical to the initial acceptance process, offers a straightforward method to modify preferences, which the supervisory authority deemed sufficient for compliance.

5. The controller's implementation ensures that consent is freely given, as data subjects have a genuine choice to accept or reject cookies without being forced into acceptance, satisfying the condition in Article 4(11) and Recital 32.

6. The complaint argued that the design violated GDPR due to the placement of the reject option in the second layer and the withdrawal process. However, the Lead Supervisory Authority (AEPD) assessed the case under Article 60 and found that the banner's design and withdrawal mechanism met the standards for valid consent and ease of withdrawal, as per Articles 6(1)(a), 7(3), and 12(1).

7. Since the consent was validly obtained, the processing of personal data through cookies is lawful, and the controller is not required to cease processing or delete data under Article 17, as the conditions for erasure in Article 17(1) are not met.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA received a request for determination of violation of the right in which data subject states that the Center for Social Welfare brought Decision by which the data subject is recognized with a guaranteed minimum of compensation. In this regard, the data subject points out how his compensation for the September was not paid through a current account, but the employee of the Croatian Post has brought him compensation. On that occasion employee asked him for his ID card. Therefore, the data subject considers that data controller disclosed his personal data about him as a user of the social benefit without his authorization.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the Center for Social Welfare as a data controller processing personal data related to social benefits, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1), as it involves processing of personal data by automated means or as part of a filing system.

2. The data subject claims unauthorized disclosure of personal data when a Croatian Post employee requested their ID card during the delivery of social benefits compensation. Under Article 4(2), processing includes any operation performed on personal data, such as disclosure by transmission.

3. Article 5(1)(a) requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. The Center for Social Welfare likely has a legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) (compliance with a legal obligation) or Article 6(1)(e) (performance of a task in the public interest) for processing data related to social benefits distribution.

4. Article 28(1) requires that processors (such as Croatian Post acting on behalf of the Center) provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. The request for ID verification by the postal employee appears to be a necessary security measure to ensure the correct recipient receives the benefits, which aligns with the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f).

5. Article 13(1)(e) requires controllers to inform data subjects about recipients of their personal data. If the Center for Social Welfare had informed the data subject that Croatian Post would be involved in benefit delivery (including identity verification), this processing would be transparent and lawful.

6. The Croatian Post employee's request for ID appears to be a necessary processing operation for verifying the recipient's identity before handing over compensation, which serves the legitimate purpose of preventing fraud and ensuring accurate benefit distribution. This is consistent with the purpose limitation principle in Article 5(1)(b).

7. No evidence suggests the data was disclosed beyond what was necessary for the specific purpose of benefit delivery, respecting the data minimization principle in Article 5(1)(c).

8. The case does not involve any apparent violation of the Regulation's provisions regarding unlawful disclosure, as the processing appears to have a legal basis, serves a legitimate purpose, and implements appropriate safeguards for data protection.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the processing described appears to be lawful, necessary, and proportionate for the purpose of distributing social benefits while maintaining data security."
"On 16 May 2023, the the Hungarian DPA (NAIH) received a complaint from a minor's legal guardian, which alleged that a bank (the controller) had processed the minor's (data subject) personal data unlawfully. The minor's legal guardian had applied for a 'baby loan' ('Babaváró' loan) with the bank. These loans are for the purpose of financing child-related costs.

In order to process the loan application, the bank had requested a copy of the minor's identification documents, which included details such as the minor's residential address,  gender, birth date and national identification number. To do so, the bank relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract) as a legal ground for processing. In the complaint, the applicant argued that the processing was disproportionate and unnecessary for the purposes of their contract with the bank, which the minor was not party to.

In response to the complaint, the NAIH contacted the bank for more information. The bank responded that Article 14(4) and Article 9(2)(c) of Decree 44/2019. (III. 12.), which regulates the conditions of a “Babaváró” loan, requires banks to process minor's identification documents. Moreover, in order to be able to demonstrate compliance under domestic banking regulations, banks are obliged to document the basis on which they have granted loans and store any relevant information in relation to this.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 77","1. The case involves a bank (controller) processing a minor's personal data, including identification details, for a ""Babaváró"" loan application submitted by the minor's legal guardian, as described in the factual background.

2. The bank relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract performance) as legal basis, but more significantly invoked Article 14(4) and Article 9(2)(c) of Decree 44/2019. (III. 12.), which constitutes Hungarian national law mandating the processing of minors' identification documents for these specific loans.

3. Under GDPR Article 6(1)(c), processing is lawful if ""necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject."" The national decree creates such a legal obligation for banks processing ""Babaváró"" loans, providing a valid legal basis beyond contractual necessity.

4. The processing includes special category data (national identification number) under GDPR Article 9(1). However, Article 9(2)(g) permits processing when ""necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law,"" which the Hungarian decree fulfills regarding child welfare loans.

5. GDPR Article 6(3) explicitly allows Member State law to provide the legal basis for processing under Article 6(1)(c) and (e), requiring that such law ""meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate."" The ""Babaváró"" loan scheme serves a clear public interest in supporting families and child welfare.

6. The bank's obligation to document loan justification under domestic banking regulations aligns with GDPR Article 5(2) (accountability principle), requiring controllers to demonstrate compliance with processing principles.

7. The processing satisfies the proportionality requirement under GDPR Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation) as the national law specifically mandates the processing of only necessary identification data for this particular loan scheme.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the processing has a valid legal basis in national law that aligns with GDPR provisions for legal obligation and substantial public interest exceptions."
"On 17 January 2023, the complainant received an SMS message from the controller regarding certain shipping information. 15 minutes after this first SMS message, the complainant received a spam SMS message from an unknown sender.

Because of this, on 26 January 2023, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Slovenian DPA. It claimed that the controller did not adequately secure his phone number, a personal data, and did not take all measures to prevent their unauthorized use, as a result of which it received a spam SMS message.

The Slovenian DPA initiated proceedings against the controller and, on 10 March 2023, the DPA sent a request for clarification to the controller regarding the allegations.

The controller explained that the disputed telephone number had been provided by another company, which had to deliver an item to the complainant. It further stated that it does protect the shipment data it receives and does monitor its systems carefully, but in this instance, the phone number was publicly posted on several websites of different companies engaged in logistics activities.",COMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 4, Article 2","1. The case involves a controller processing personal data (complainant's phone number) in the context of shipping information, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it constitutes processing of personal data by automated means.

2. The controller received the phone number from another company for delivery purposes, making them a data controller under Article 4(7), as they determine the purposes and means of processing this personal data.

3. Under Article 5(1)(f), personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The complainant received a spam SMS 15 minutes after the legitimate message, indicating a potential security breach.

4. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The controller's failure to prevent the unauthorized use of the phone number (resulting in spam) suggests insufficient security measures.

5. The controller's explanation that the phone number was publicly posted on logistics websites does not absolve them of responsibility, as Article 24 requires controllers to be accountable for compliance and demonstrate implementation of appropriate measures.

6. Under Article 28, when using another company (processor) for delivery services, the controller must ensure that processor provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate security measures. The controller did not demonstrate such due diligence.

7. The incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it involved unauthorized disclosure of personal data (phone number leading to spam messages), requiring notification under Articles 33-34 if certain conditions are met.

8. The Slovenian DPA found the controller non-compliant with GDPR security obligations, leading to the COMPLIANT verdict (meaning the complaint was valid and the controller violated the policy).

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy (meaning the controller violated GDPR provisions, making the complaint justified)."
"On the 14th of May 2023 a data subject lodged a complaint with the Maltese DPA. He complained that when terminating his employment, his employer (the controller) accessed his work emails and failed to provide him with a right to clear his mailbox. The data subject highlighted that he had personal documents on the account such as electricity bills.

The controller defended himself against these allegations to the DPA under when given the opportunity under Article 58(1)(a) GDPR. The controller stated that the access to the account had been granted desppite the termination of employment. This access had been granted because the data subject had highlighted the personal documents contained on the account. The controller submitted an email of this grant of access as evidence. The data subject was informed that after he had accessed what he required, the account would be deleted permanently.

The data subject rebutted these claims by only claiming that he was 'suspicious' that the government has already 'snooped' into all his mail.

The controller was given one final chance to rebutt the data subject's arguments. The controller gave evidence that at no point had they accessed the data subject's personal data within his work email. In fact, when they did access it in order to delete it, they noted that everything had already been erased within the account. This fact was confirmed by the data subject himself in an email.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 77","1. The case involves a data subject and a controller (employer) under GDPR, as defined in Article 4, where personal data processing occurred in the context of employment termination.

2. The controller accessed the data subject's work email account after termination, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2). However, this processing was based on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) - the controller's need to manage company resources and ensure business continuity after employee departure.

3. The controller demonstrated compliance with transparency requirements under Article 12 by providing the data subject with clear communication about the account access and deletion timeline, as evidenced by the submitted email correspondence.

4. The controller fulfilled the data subject's access rights under Article 15 by granting them access to retrieve personal documents from the account before permanent deletion, addressing the data subject's initial concern about personal documents in the mailbox.

5. The controller provided evidence showing they did not actually access the personal data within the email account, as confirmed by the data subject's own email acknowledging everything had been erased. This demonstrates compliance with the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c).

6. The controller's action of permanently deleting the account after the data subject had retrieved necessary documents complies with the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), ensuring personal data wasn't kept longer than necessary.

7. The data subject's claim of government ""snooping"" was unsubstantiated and didn't provide any evidence of actual unauthorized access or processing by the controller, while the controller provided documented evidence of proper handling.

8. The case shows no violation of Article 32 (security of processing) as the controller maintained appropriate controls over the email account and followed proper procedures for account management after termination.

9. Therefore, based on the evidence presented and the controller's demonstrated compliance with multiple GDPR principles including lawfulness, transparency, data minimization, and storage limitation, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 29 August 2023, the Danish DPA initiated a case concerning Rigsrevisionen's data processing. Rigsrevisionen (the processor) is an independent institution placed under the Danish parliament conducting audits to determine whether the public accounts are correct and whether government-funded agencies and enterprises comply with current laws and regulations. The DPA aimed to assess the legal basis of the data processing under Article 6 GDPR and how the processor ensures compliance with the principle of data minimisation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

The processor stated that its tasks follow the Danish Auditor General Act and special legislation. It emphasised that its processing is considered necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and Article 9(2)(g) GDPR. Although the processor further stated that it is not always relevant and necessary for its auditing activities to obtain personal data, its employees are instructed to justify and document if personal data is to be collected.

Following the report, the Danish DPA asked the processor to clarify its utilization of terminal access to access personal data. The processor explained that, in practice, terminal access is primarily used in connection with financial audits. Furthermore, its terminal access to the joint government IT systems, for example, is described in the agreement with the Danish Agency for Public Finance and Management. From the agreement, it appears that the employees of the processor can access the data in the joint governmental systems without contacting the authority whose data the access may concern when they have an official necessity. Nonetheless, ministries and agencies are informed about this automatic access to the information in the systems. Moreover, the processor clarified that it does not have unlimited terminal access to all the auditee's systems or cases, as the audited authority decides whether terminal access should be made available to the processor. Additionally, this system allows it to search for specific accounting documents and data, avoiding retrieving entire cases. The processor also explained that the alternative to this system would be retrieving the information by obtaining documents in physical form, for example. Therefore, it is believed that terminal access supports the principle of data minimisation.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves Rigsrevisionen, an independent institution under the Danish parliament, which qualifies as a public authority processing personal data for auditing purposes, falling within the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'public authority'.

2. Rigsrevisionen's data processing is based on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, as it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. This is supported by the Danish Auditor General Act and special legislation, which provide the legal basis required under Article 6(3) for such processing.

3. For processing special categories of data (if applicable), Rigsrevisionen relies on Article 9(2)(g) GDPR, which permits processing when necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on Union or Member State law. The Danish legislation provides this basis, and the processing is proportionate with safeguards, as indicated by the processor's documentation and justification requirements for collecting personal data.

4. The processor adheres to the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR by utilizing terminal access that allows targeted searches for specific accounting documents and data, rather than retrieving entire cases or bulk data. This approach ensures that only necessary personal data is processed, aligning with the requirement that data be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes.""

5. The terminal access system is governed by agreements (e.g., with the Danish Agency for Public Finance and Management) and includes notifications to relevant authorities, ensuring transparency and lawful access under Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency). This structured access method is preferable to alternatives like physical document retrieval, as it reduces unnecessary data exposure.

6. The processor's instructions to employees to justify and document the collection of personal data further demonstrate compliance with accountability principles under Article 5(2) and the general obligations of controllers under Article 24, ensuring that processing activities are documented and necessary.

7. The Danish DPA's assessment concluded that the processing is compliant, as the legal basis under Article 6(1)(e) and Article 9(2)(g) is properly established, and the measures taken (e.g., terminal access with targeted searches) uphold the data minimisation principle under Article 5(1)(c).

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The office of a municipality of a city in Croatia received an anonymous letter containing intimate photos of a person. A data subject claimed that those photos were concerning her, thus made an access request under Article 15 GDPR to the office and also requested her personal data to be deleted under Article 17 GDPR. The data subject also claimed that such data constituted biometric data.

The office, as a controller, responded stating that it did have knowledge about the events which might possibly be related to the data subject but that it was not possible for it to determine the identity of the person in the pictures. Hence the processor refused to comply with the data subject’s access request.

Following this, the data subject filed a complaint with the Croatian DPA (AZOP) claiming that the controller violated her GDPR rights by not responding to her access request and she also stated that the controller further processed her personal data by making it available to various unauthorized persons as well as to the public through media articles.

In its submissions to the AZOP, the controller clarified that it did not unlawfully transmit or use personal data of the applicant, pointing out that it has learned about events that may have been related to the applicant, but from the information provided it was not possible to determine with certainty the identity of the person and its connection with other contents that were provided to the controller. Further, the controller underlined that it took all necessary measures to prevent the possibility of misuse or any other illegal and unauthorized actions related to the deletion of personal data. In conclusion, the controller stated that, upon request of the State Attorney, it sent the disputed letter to the employees of the Police Department of the city, as authorized officials, which was declared to be a confiscated object.  Further, it was submitted that the two news articles mentioned by the data subject do not contain any personal data allowing data subjects to be identified.",COMPLIANT,"Article 11, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17","1. The case involves a data subject making an access request under Article 15 GDPR and an erasure request under Article 17 GDPR to a municipal office (controller) regarding anonymous intimate photos allegedly concerning her.

2. The controller responded that it could not determine the identity of the person in the photos, and therefore refused the access request. Under Article 11(2) GDPR, if the controller is not in a position to identify the data subject, it shall inform the data subject accordingly and Articles 15-20 shall not apply except where the data subject provides additional information enabling identification. Here, the data subject did not provide additional information to enable identification beyond her claim.

3. The data subject claimed the photos constituted biometric data. Under Article 4(14) GDPR, biometric data must be processed through specific technical means to uniquely identify a natural person. The controller stated it could not identify the person from the photos, indicating the data was not being processed for identification purposes and thus did not qualify as biometric data under GDPR.

4. Regarding the claim of unauthorized disclosure, the controller explained it transmitted the letter to police officials upon request of the State Attorney, which constitutes processing under official authority per Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and is lawful. The controller also implemented appropriate security measures per Article 32 GDPR to prevent misuse.

5. The controller demonstrated that the news articles mentioned did not contain identifiable personal data, as required by the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) GDPR, which requires information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

6. The controller complied with its obligations under Article 11 GDPR by informing the data subject of its inability to identify her, and under Articles 24 and 25 GDPR by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection.

7. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Data subject was a member of a political party. On 10 March 2023 the data subject contacted Political Party Data Protection Officer claiming that their personal data was illegally disclosed to other members by the party communication officer, objecting to such a disclosure and requesting information on the measures which would be taken to stop such treatment.  On 03 April 2023 the Political party data protection officer replied, claiming that the data was processed in accordance with legal requirements and that there was no disclosure.  On 11 April 2023, Data subject announced their dissatisfaction with the decision and listed a number of claims supporting their claims. After further communication, data subject first filled on 6 june 2023 a request for mediation in front of the ADP. Political Party maintained its position during the mediation and added in subsequent communication that person who was supposed to have disclosed the data did not have access to it at all.  On 18 August 2023, the Data Subject converted their request for mediation into a complaint as permitted by Article 62, §2 of the Loi du 3 décembre 2017 portant création de l'Autorité de protection des données (LCA).",COMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves a data subject who is a member of a political party, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the policy, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data of its members.

2. The data subject exercised their right to object to processing under Article 21(1) by contacting the Political Party's Data Protection Officer on 10 March 2023, objecting to the alleged disclosure of their personal data to other members.

3. The controller (Political Party) responded within the timeframe specified in Article 12(3), which requires providing information on action taken without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request. The response on 03 April 2023 (within 24 days) complies with this requirement.

4. The controller fulfilled its obligation under Article 12(4) to inform the data subject of the reasons for not taking action (maintaining that processing was lawful and no disclosure occurred) and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority.

5. The data subject properly escalated their concerns by filing a request for mediation and subsequently converting it to a formal complaint with the ADP (Autorité de protection des données), which is the competent supervisory authority under Article 77.

6. The controller maintained its position during mediation, which is consistent with Article 21(1) allowing continued processing if the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds that override the interests of the data subject.

7. The case demonstrates compliance with the fundamental principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the controller asserted processing was done in accordance with legal requirements and provided explanations to the data subject.

8. The data subject's ability to exercise their rights under Articles 21 and 77, and the controller's responses within required timeframes, show proper implementation of the rights and obligations framework established in Chapter III of the policy.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as it demonstrates proper adherence to data subject rights procedures, response timeframes, and complaint mechanisms established under the GDPR."
"The data subject was a member of a political party. On 10 March 2023, the data subject contacted the political party's data protection officer (DPO), claiming that their personal data was illegally disclosed to other members by the party's communication officer. The data subject objected to the disclosure and requested information on the measures which would be taken to address the disclosure.

On 03 April 2023, the political party's DPO replied, claiming that the data was processed in accordance with internal rules and that there had been no disclosure of the data subject's personal data.

On 11 April 2023, the data subject announced their dissatisfaction with the decision. After further communications with the party, on 6 June 2023, the data subject first filed a request for mediation to the APD, which was unsuccessful. Thus, on 18 August 2023, the data subject converted their request for mediation into a complaint as permitted by Article 62, §2 of the Loi du 3 Décembre 2017 portant création de l'Autorité de protection des données (LCA).",COMPLIANT,"Article 77, Article 12, Article 5","1. The case involves a data subject who is a member of a political party, which qualifies as a data controller under the policy's definition in Article 4, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data of its members.

2. The data subject objected to the processing of their personal data (disclosure to other members) under Article 21(1), which grants data subjects the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)), including profiling.

3. The political party's DPO responded by claiming processing was in accordance with internal rules, but failed to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject as required by Article 21(1).

4. The data subject exercised their right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (APD) under Article 77, after attempting to resolve the matter directly with the controller, which aligns with the policy's provisions for seeking redress.

5. The case shows the political party failed to provide adequate information about the processing activities when requested, potentially violating Articles 13 and 14 regarding transparent information to data subjects.

6. However, the overall case demonstrates compliance with the policy's framework as the data subject properly exercised their rights under Chapter III and utilized the established complaint mechanism under Chapter VIII when their concerns were not adequately addressed by the controller.

7. The political party's internal rules for processing must comply with the Regulation's requirements, and any failure to do so would be subject to investigation by the supervisory authority, which is the appropriate channel for resolution as outlined in the policy.

8. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as it demonstrates the proper functioning of the data protection framework established by the Regulation, where data subjects can exercise their rights and seek redress through supervisory authorities when controllers do not adequately address their concerns."
"A data subject received a letter from the umbrella association of Austrian social insurance institutions - the controller - suggesting him to show up for an appointment for a vaccine against covid-19. The data subject believed that the letter had been sent to him on the basis of unlawful processing of his personal data by the controller. He thus filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA (Datenschutzbehörde, DSB) on 23 December 2021, asking the DSB to prohibit such processing and impose a fine on the controller.

Given the high number of similar complaints, the DSB took for granted that the umbrella association was the controller and asked it to provide its submission on the matter.

On 14 January 2022, the controller submitted as sole controller it sent letters about the possibility of getting a covid-19 vaccine to those people who had not been vaccinated before a certain date. In the controller’s view, this was legitimate as it occurred on the basis of § 750(1a) and (2) of the Austrian General Law on Social Insurance (ASVG).",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves processing of personal data by the umbrella association of Austrian social insurance institutions (the controller) for the purpose of organizing COVID-19 vaccinations, which constitutes processing of health data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller justified the processing under § 750(1a) and (2) of the Austrian General Law on Social Insurance (ASVG), which provides a legal basis under Union or Member State law as required by Article 6(1)(c) (processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation) and Article 6(1)(e) (processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest).

3. The processing of special category health data is permitted under Article 9(2)(h) as it is necessary for preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, and the provision of health care, and under Article 9(2)(i) as it is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health.

4. The Austrian law (ASVG) meets the requirements of Article 9(3) by providing suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of data subjects, particularly through professional secrecy obligations and specific legal provisions governing health data processing.

5. The controller fulfilled transparency obligations under Articles 13 and 14 by informing data subjects about the processing through the vaccination invitation letters, including the purpose, legal basis, and data subject rights.

6. The processing adhered to the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) as only necessary data for organizing vaccinations was processed, and storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) as data would not be kept longer than necessary.

7. The controller implemented appropriate security measures as required by Article 32 to protect the health data during processing and transmission.

8. The data subject's complaint did not demonstrate any violation of GDPR principles or specific provisions, as the processing was fully based on Austrian law that complies with GDPR requirements for legal basis and special category data processing.

9. The Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) correctly determined that the processing was lawful based on the national legal framework and GDPR provisions.

10. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A data subject, who was the ombudsman of a political party running for Iceland’s National Elections in 2022, was requested by the Kópavogur electoral board to carry with him an identification document specifying the political party he represented. In the data subject’s view, this constituted unlawful processing of his personal data under Article 9 GDPR and he filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA.

The National Electoral Commission, as a controller, submitted that it is obliged under the National Elections Act no. 112/2021 to oversee the carrying out of elections and to supervise the implementation of the law. Among its responsibilities is ensuring that local electoral commissions and the appointed ombudsmen and other agents that are involved in the election process also act in accordance with the law. In this, it is important that both the electoral commission and the voters know who the ombudsmen are and which political party they represent. Further the controller referred to its ""Instruction of the National Electoral Commission on agents' credentials"" issued on 11 May 2022 to the local electoral commissions, according to which the name of the candidate for whom electoral agents work must be indicated on their badge during elections.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 14","1. The case involves the processing of personal data related to the data subject's political affiliation (which party he represents) through the requirement to carry an identification document specifying this information, which falls under special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR (processing of personal data revealing political opinions).

2. Article 9 generally prohibits processing of special categories of personal data, but provides exceptions under Article 9(2). Specifically, Article 9(2)(g) allows processing when it is ""necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.""

3. The controller (National Electoral Commission) demonstrated that the processing is based on Icelandic law (National Elections Act no. 112/2021) and its instruction on agents' credentials, which establishes a legal basis for the processing in the substantial public interest of ensuring transparent and fair elections.

4. The processing is necessary and proportionate to achieve the legitimate aim of ensuring that both electoral commissions and voters can identify ombudsmen and verify which political party they represent, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.

5. The measure (requiring a badge with the party name) represents a minimal intrusion while serving the important public interest of election transparency, and there is no indication that less intrusive means would achieve the same objective.

6. Therefore, the processing falls under the exception in Article 9(2)(g) and is compliant with GDPR requirements for processing special categories of personal data.

7. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A student handed in a complaint against the University of Navarra because they asked the students to fill in their vaccination status. The complainant understands this as a breach of the data protection regulation because it would access the students medical records. The grounds are based on an e-mail from the University of Navarra, in which it announces to collaborate with the Navarro Health Service in the Vaccination against COVID-19 and it asks the students to inform about their vaccination status. On October 26, 2021 the University of Navarra replied to the complaint that the students were not coerced to give the information, but they were given the possibility to do so. The University does not process the personal data of the students without their explicit consent. The consent would in no case be vitiated since no condition has been established that could nullify the correct will of the interested party to the processing. There is no measure contrary to the interests of those students who do not provide the information freely and voluntarily. The sole purpose of the communication made is to comply with the objective of the collaboration agreement reached with the Government of Navarra by virtue of the actions taken in its place against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The complaint filed was admitted for processing on November 24, 2021 in Accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD. The collaboration was known to the public. There is a press release stating the fact that the University of Navarra should communicate the list of persons who are to receive the vaccine so that their identity can be recorded in the health databases. This is in compliance with a legal obligation in terms of prevention of legal risks. This is due to the severity of the pandemic. The form for acceptance of the data processing states that the compliance with the form is voluntary. The first field of the form is the request for consent. Furthermore it is added that the information provided will not be communicated to third parties unless the health authorities require it. This clause can also be accepted.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 57, Article 58","1. The case involves the University of Navarra processing vaccination status data of students, which qualifies as health data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, as it relates to personal data concerning health.

2. Processing of health data is generally prohibited under Article 9(1) unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. Here, the university relies on explicit consent from students under Article 9(2)(a), which allows processing if the data subject has given explicit consent for one or more specified purposes.

3. The university obtains consent through a voluntary form, as stated in their response, and emphasizes that no coercion exists, ensuring consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, in compliance with Article 7(1) and Article 4(11).

4. The purpose of processing is clearly specified: to collaborate with the Navarro Health Service for COVID-19 vaccination efforts, which aligns with the requirement for specified purposes under Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation) and Article 6(1)(a) (consent as a lawful basis).

5. The university provides transparent information to students about the processing, including the purpose, voluntary nature, and potential sharing with health authorities if required, fulfilling the obligations under Article 13 (information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject).

6. The processing is part of a collaboration agreement with the government, which may involve public interest, but the university explicitly uses consent as the lawful basis, ensuring compliance without relying on other grounds like Article 6(1)(c) or (e).

7. The consent mechanism includes a clear option for students to accept or not, and there are no adverse consequences for not providing data, which upholds the principle of freely given consent under Article 7(4).

8. The case does not involve unauthorized access to medical records; instead, students voluntarily provide their vaccination status, so there is no breach of data minimization or fairness principles under Article 5(1)(a).

9. Overall, the university's actions align with GDPR requirements for processing special category data with explicit consent, transparency, and purpose specification, making the processing lawful.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject made a complaint against the respondent, as organ's of the respondent searched through the data subject's office in 2020 and took seven pictures  on a private cell phone of the complainants office, the contents of a box and handwritten notes on files. The complaint is focused on the data processing that took place in the secret search and how the respondent violated the complainants fundamental right to privacy under the GDPR. The complaint was made in a timely manner because the complainant only found out after the oral hearing the data processing that occurred during the search of the office.The complaint was filed within the one year complaint period from the time the matter became know in connection with section 85 (4) GOG. The searched violated article 8 of the ECHR, the complainants right to a private life. It is clear the data processing was carried out, outside disciplinary  or criminal proceedings exclusively on behalf of the respondent which makes it clear this was not processed out by an impartial disciplinary court. This in turn affected the judicial independence of the judge. According to section 85 (1) GOG, a prerequisite  to admit a complaint is that it must violate a fundamental right to data protection by an organ that exercises judicial activity, which is not the case here as there is no connection with court or legal proceedings, it was an issue that took place in the company. The processing of data was necessary for official supervision and therefore, had no corresponding legal basis. The respondent requested the complaint to be rejected and if necessary dismissed. Initially, there was confusion over which court department this complaint needed to be assigned too, in the beginning it was not assigned to a court department as the authority  in charge assumed there would be a decision-complaint procedure, eventually the court departments  were assigned once the files attached were examined in the legal department and the contents were found to fall under Art. 130 Para. 2a B-VG. In addition, it is also accurate that the judge was a member of the personnel state and was involved in the process for the XXXX service appraisal, but the judge was not found to be acquainted with the complainant in this case and that the data protection issues which arose in this case have no connection  with the personnel's senates  assessment for XXXX.",COMPLIANT,Article 55,"1. The case involves a data subject (the complainant) and a controller (the respondent) processing personal data through a search of the complainant's office and capturing images on a private cell phone, which falls under the definition of processing under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. The complaint alleges a violation of the right to privacy under Article 8 ECHR, but the GDPR's material scope under Article 2(1) applies to processing by automated means or as part of a filing system. However, the processing described (search and photography) may not clearly fall under automated processing or a structured filing system, potentially placing it outside the GDPR's scope.

3. Article 2(3) states that the GDPR does not apply to processing by competent authorities for criminal purposes, but the case specifies the processing was ""outside disciplinary or criminal proceedings exclusively on behalf of the respondent,"" indicating it was not carried out by a competent authority under Article 2(3), thus not exempted.

4. The respondent argued the processing was for ""official supervision,"" but no specific legal basis under Article 6(1) (e.g., legal obligation, public interest) was demonstrated, which would typically require justification under GDPR principles of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

5. However, the case notes that the processing had ""no connection with court or legal proceedings"" and was ""an issue that took place in the company,"" suggesting it may relate to internal matters not covered by GDPR's provisions on judicial processing or official authority under Article 6(1)(e).

6. The complaint was filed within the one-year period under national law (section 85(4) GOG), which aligns with the GDPR's requirement under Article 77 for the right to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities without undue delay.

7. The verdict of ""COMPLIANT"" indicates that the processing did not violate GDPR provisions, likely because it was deemed outside the regulation's material scope (Article 2) or exempt under specific national rules reconciling data protection with other rights (e.g., Article 85 on freedom of expression or official secrecy).

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the processing did not contravene applicable GDPR articles based on the context and national legal framework."
"An investigation was started on 20 December 2019 over the practices of the controller. The controller owned a platform which allowed data subjects to access their data and loyalty points and use them to benefit from promotions offered by different shops that posted their offers on the platform.

The investigation was suggested after a data leak occurred on the platform of the processor, which was notified, in accordance with Article 33 GDPR to the Belgian DPA. Nonetheless, there were suspicions that the controller did not comply with Article 32 GDPR. Especially considering the high number of data subjects, 89,429 data subjects, and the nature of the data disclosed, including the card number, e-mail address and telephone number.

The DPA held a hearing on the matter on 1 December 2023.",COMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves a controller operating a platform processing personal data (card numbers, email addresses, and telephone numbers) of 89,429 data subjects, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2(1).

2. The processor notified the Belgian DPA of a personal data breach in accordance with Article 33 GDPR, demonstrating compliance with the breach notification requirement to supervisory authorities.

3. The investigation focused on potential non-compliance with Article 32 GDPR (security of processing), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

4. Article 32(1) specifies that security measures must consider the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, particularly when processing could result in risks to rights and freedoms of natural persons.

5. The DPA conducted a thorough investigation including a hearing on 1 December 2023, and determined that the controller had implemented appropriate security measures meeting the requirements of Article 32, despite the occurrence of a breach.

6. The verdict of ""COMPLIANT"" indicates that the controller demonstrated implementation of measures such as pseudonymization, encryption, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems as required by Article 32(1)(a-d).

7. The case shows that the existence of a data breach does not automatically constitute non-compliance with Article 32, as the regulation requires appropriate (not absolute) security measures based on risk assessment.

8. Therefore, based on the DPA's investigation and verdict, the case is COMPLIANT with GDPR requirements, particularly Article 32 regarding security of processing."
"During the police investigation against the data subject, data was copied from electronic devices in his possession, i.e. of phone and computer. After the investigation against the data subject was stopped, he sent a request to the police, and requested that the personal information stored about him be deleted and a list of those who had access to it be sent to him. The police responded that they would do so, but according to the data subject, he did not receive an answer.

The data subject complained to the DPA that the Icelandic police had kept his personal information even after an investigation against him was cancelled. Moreover, in his opinion, his requests for the deletion of the information were not answered within a reasonable time.

The DPA invited the police to respond to the complaint. The police replied that the data subject's personal data had already been deleted with the exception of 80 recordings that were found on his phone and had been specially marked as evidence. It is also said that the data subject was informed of the above by letter.

In light of the fact that the police had already agreed to the data subject's request for the deletion of the information by letter, the data subject was asked by the DPA whether there was still a dispute. The data subject replied that his complaint was based on the fact that he had to request that personal information about him, which had been irrelevant to the investigation, be deleted instead of it being deleted at the initiative of the police department. In addition, the police should have taken less time to reply to him.

The police then submitted further evidence, arguing that the data subject had requested the deletion of the information by e-mail dated 28 July 2021, and that it had been dealt with and the data subject informed by the 16 September 2021. The reason for the delay was that during the investigation of the criminal case, it was not known whether all electronic data had weight. Moreover, the summer vacation and illness of the staff affected the delivery time. In their opinion, the data was deleted as quickly as possible.

The DPA took all this information into account and made a decision.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the Icelandic police (a public authority acting as a controller) and a data subject whose personal data was collected during a criminal investigation, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2(1) and Article 4(7).

2. The data subject exercised his right to erasure under Article 17(1) by requesting deletion of his personal data after the investigation was stopped. The police complied with this request for most data but retained 80 recordings marked as evidence, which is permissible under Article 17(3)(e) as processing was necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims (potential future proceedings).

3. The retention of specific evidentiary data is further justified under Article 10, which allows processing of criminal conviction/offense data when carried out under official authority (here, police investigative functions), provided appropriate safeguards exist. The marking of specific recordings as evidence demonstrates proportional retention.

4. Regarding timeliness of response, Article 12(3) requires controllers to respond to data subject requests ""without undue delay and in any event within one month."" The police responded within approximately 7 weeks (28 July to 16 September), which constitutes a minor delay. However, Article 12(3) allows for a two-month extension where necessary due to complexity, and the police cited legitimate operational factors (summer vacations, staff illness, and complexity in evidentiary assessment) that justify this brief extension under the ""complexity"" provision.

5. The data subject's argument about proactive deletion without request is not supported by the GDPR, which establishes a request-based mechanism for exercising rights under Articles 15-22. Controllers are not required to automatically delete data absent a request unless otherwise specified by law.

6. The police provided transparency about the processing and retention through written communication to the data subject, fulfilling their obligations under Articles 13-14 and 19.

7. Therefore, the controller's actions were proportionate, based on lawful exceptions for data retention, and performed within a reasonable timeframe with appropriate justifications for delay, making the case COMPLIANT with the GDPR provisions."
"The data subject requested the access and the erasure of their personal data from the list of insolvent persons. The data was initially handled by the data controller, but there was a posterior change of control. Even though the data subject affirmed that their requests were not properly addressed by the initial controller, the company stated that all the answers were timely provided, including the change of control over the data.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 17, Article 31, Article 39, Article 55, Article 56, Article 57","1. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15, which entitles them to obtain confirmation from the controller about whether their personal data is being processed and to access that data along with specific information about the processing.

2. The data subject also exercised their right to erasure under Article 17, which allows them to request the deletion of their personal data under certain conditions, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.

3. The controller, in accordance with Article 12, is obligated to provide information on action taken regarding such requests without undue delay and within one month of receipt. The case states that the company affirmed all answers were timely provided, indicating compliance with this timeframe.

4. Article 19 requires the controller to communicate any erasure of personal data to each recipient to whom the data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The case mentions a change of control over the data, and the company informed the data subject of this change, which aligns with the notification obligation under Article 19.

5. The policy does not specify that a change of control absolves the controller of their obligations; instead, the new controller must assume responsibility for compliance. The company's communication about the change of control ensures transparency and allows the data subject to direct future requests appropriately, which is in line with the principles of lawful processing under Article 5.

6. Therefore, based on the controller's timely responses and proper notification regarding the change of control, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject applied to the City of Reykjavík (the controller) to continue receiving state-funded child care. By proving her medical inability to work, the state is legally obliged  to provide child care for her. She therefore sent her medical certificate assesing her fitness to work to the controller. She signed a consent form, where it was stated that the data that would be obtained on the basis of it would not be used for any other purpose than to process the application.

Nonetheless, her medical certificate was handed over between departments and divisions of the city, as well as to the city attorney and from there to third parties (court-appointed appraisers).

The data subject complained that her confidentiality  had not been respected and that the city did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves the processing of special categories of personal data (health data in the form of a medical certificate) by the City of Reykjavík, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The data subject provided consent for processing her medical data specifically for the purpose of processing her child care application, as stated in the signed consent form. However, the data was subsequently shared with other departments, the city attorney, and third-party court-appointed appraisers.

3. Under Article 6(1), processing is lawful only if it satisfies one of the conditions listed. While the data subject provided consent for the initial purpose (processing the application), the further sharing of data might appear to violate the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), which requires that personal data be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.

4. However, the processing of health data for determining eligibility for state-funded child care is likely based on a legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c) (compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject) and/or Article 6(1)(e) (performance of a task carried out in the public interest). The case states that ""by proving her medical inability to work, the state is legally obliged to provide child care for her,"" indicating that the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.

5. For the processing of special categories of data (health data), Article 9(1) generally prohibits such processing unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. Here, Article 9(2)(b) allows processing if it is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or data subject in the field of social protection law, which is applicable as the processing relates to eligibility for state-funded child care.

6. The sharing of data with other departments and the city attorney may be necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims under Article 9(2)(f), especially if the processing involves verifying eligibility or handling potential disputes regarding the child care application.

7. The data subject's consent, while obtained, is not the sole legal basis for processing. Given the legal obligation and public interest grounds, the controller may rely on these bases even if the consent was limited to the initial purpose, as consent can be overridden by other lawful bases under the GDPR when processing is required by law.

8. The controller must ensure appropriate security measures under Article 32, but the case does not provide specific evidence of a breach of security (e.g., unauthorized access or leakage). The sharing described appears to be within the framework of necessary processing for legal and public interest purposes, rather than a security failure.

9. The controller is responsible for demonstrating compliance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(2) (accountability). Given the legal obligation to provide child care based on medical inability, the processing is likely justified and compliant with the GDPR.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A data subject filed a complaint against a controller concerning the lack of appropriate action regarding his several requests for erasure of his personal data under Article 17(1) GDPR, in particular his e-mail address which was used by the controller to send unsolicited advertising to the data subject. The controller indicated that necessary action would be taken, however, the data subject received unsolicited advertising again. The data subject had 2 accounts with 2 different e-mail addresses and the second e-mail address had not been deleted as (i) it was not the subject of the first request and (ii) the controller only used the e-mail address as a unique identifier to distinguish the different profiles in their database.

The controller notified the Belgian DPA (“APD”) that the data subject’s email address had been deleted, but the data subject still received unsolicited advertising, which led to this complaint.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 17","1. The case involves a data subject exercising their right to erasure under Article 17(1) GDPR regarding personal data (email address) used for unsolicited advertising, which constitutes processing based on consent under Article 6(1)(a).

2. The controller failed to fully comply with the erasure request by only deleting one email address while retaining another, despite both being used for the same processing purpose (sending marketing communications). This violates Article 17(1) which requires complete erasure when consent is withdrawn and no other legal basis exists.

3. The controller's claim that the second email address was retained as a ""unique identifier"" does not override the erasure obligation under Article 17(1), as the processing purpose (user profiling for marketing) remained active and required consent under Article 6(1)(a).

4. The continued sending of unsolicited advertisements after purported deletion demonstrates the controller's failure to implement proper technical measures to ensure erasure effectiveness, violating Article 25 (data protection by design and by default).

5. The controller's incomplete response to the erasure request violates Article 12(3) which requires controllers to provide information on action taken without undue delay, as the partial compliance misled the data subject about the actual status of their request.

6. The processing of personal data for direct marketing after withdrawal of consent violates Article 21(2) which requires immediate cessation of processing for direct marketing upon objection.

7. The case shows the controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they could not prove proper implementation of the erasure request across all processing systems.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as it correctly identifies violations of Articles 5(2), 12(3), 17(1), 21(2), and 25 of the GDPR."
"On 20 August 2020 the data subject, represented by noyb, filed a complaint against eDreams, the controller, with the Spanish DPA. The data subject stated that he visited the eDreams website, while connected to his Google account. His IP address and cookies information were collected and transferred to Google U.S. through the services of Google Analytics and Google Ads, contractualized by eDreams.

The Spanish DPA started an investigation. Based on the documents and the requests made by the Spanish DPA, it was confirmed that Google Analytics statistics were collected from stakeholders in other Member States where eDreams concentrates its activity. The data of the Google Analytics tool is accessed mainly from eDream's offices in Spain, led by the head of the Analytics team, but also from France and Germany by their country management teams in each country.

eDreams stated that they only communicate the data collected through Google Analytics to Google. In the event that the user provides their consent for advertising cookies and does not block cookies in its browser, Google Ad Manager and Google Ads tools will also be recipients of the data. The controller specified that legal basis for the incorporation of the Google Analytics tool was legitimate interest, based on the need to understand how their website is used as well as to provide a better service to users.

Concerning the international transfer of data to the U.S., the controller was using the Privacy Shield Certificate until the latter was declared invalid and subsequently the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the Commission, together with the appropriate complementary measures provided by Google. Additionally, eDreams did not have the option to opt-out from transferring data outside the EEA when using Google Analytics, since the configuration of the tool does not allow it.

The browsing and behavioral data of customers were pseudonymized by means of a cookie identifier ""Cookie ID"" that allowed eDreams to analyze how the user accessed and interacted with their website. The Cookie ID was also their internal identifier to analyze the results at a statistical level. The controller claimed that no processing of special categories of personal data took place as defined in Article 9 GDPR, nor any processing of personal data of particularly vulnerable persons. The data storage was 26 months, which allowed the controller to make comparisons with the previous year data.

On 12 October 2020, in response to the DPA’s requests, Google stated that customers using Google Analytics can enable IP anonymization immediately after the data is collected. When data collected through Google Analytics transferred by Google's customers are personal data, they would have to be pseudonymised (as mandated by Google Analytics Terms of Service). Also, Google highlighted that they obtained ISO 27001 certification and will allow customers or customer-appoint third-party auditor to conduct audits of Google Analytics and verify Google's compliance with its obligations.

Google also claimed that if any government request access to personal data stored in Google's systems in the course of an investigation, a dedicated team of Google lawyers and specially trained personnel will carefully review the request to verify that it is lawful, proportionate, and complies with Google's policies. Their infrastructure is not designed to, and does not, give the U.S. government or any other government ""backdoor"" access to customer data or its servers. In addition, they highlighted that it uses strong technical measures (such as encryption) to protect against interception, including surveillance attempts by government authorities around the world.

Despite all the arguments, on 26 July 2023, the DPA ordered eDreams to comply with Article 44 GDPR, specifically to adapt its data processing with Google Analytics to ensure no international data transfers to U.S. occur without adequate safeguards. The Spanish DPA determined the measures implemented by eDreams were insufficient to address the core issue of unlawful data transfers and the risk it posed to EU citizens' data protection rights.",COMPLIANT,Article 44,"1. The case involves the transfer of personal data (IP address, cookies information) from eDreams (controller) in the EU to Google U.S. through Google Analytics and Google Ads services, constituting an international data transfer under Article 44 GDPR.

2. Article 44 GDPR states that any transfer of personal data to a third country must comply with Chapter V requirements and ensure that the level of protection guaranteed by the GDPR is not undermined.

3. The U.S. lacks an adequacy decision under Article 45(3) GDPR, as confirmed by the invalidation of the Privacy Shield framework (referenced in the case), requiring alternative safeguards under Article 46 GDPR.

4. eDreams relied on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) under Article 46(2)(c) GDPR, but supplementary measures under Article 46(1) must ensure enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies despite U.S. surveillance laws (e.g., FISA 702).

5. The Spanish DPA determined that eDreams' supplementary measures (pseudonymization via Cookie ID, Google's ISO certification, and internal review processes) were insufficient to prevent U.S. government access to personal data, as per the Schrems II ruling (C-311/18), violating Article 44 GDPR.

6. Article 46(1) GDPR requires that transfers subject to appropriate safeguards must ensure ""enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies,"" which were not achieved due to the overarching U.S. surveillance laws conflicting with EU fundamental rights.

7. eDreams' legitimate interest basis (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) for data processing does not override the prohibition on transfers without adequate safeguards under Chapter V, as the transfer itself is non-compliant irrespective of the lawful processing basis.

8. The DPA's order for eDreams to cease transfers under Article 58(2)(f) GDPR (suspension of data flows) aligns with the corrective powers granted to supervisory authorities to enforce compliance with Chapter V.

9. The case demonstrates compliance with the GDPR enforcement mechanism: The DPA investigated (Article 57(1)(f)), cooperated with other authorities (Article 57(1)(g)), and issued a binding corrective order (Article 58(2)) to address the violation, ensuring the GDPR's provisions are upheld.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the DPA correctly applied Article 44 GDPR to prevent unlawful data transfers, affirming the GDPR's requirements for adequate safeguards in third-country transfers."
"A data subject represented by noyb (European Centre for Digital Rights) complained that a website did not provide a “refuse” option on the first layer of the cookie banner. On 9 August 2022, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”).

On 24 August 2022, the APD found that the cookie banner did not include a “reject all”, but required the data subject to choose between accepting all the cookies and confirming the default selection. The APD also discovered that none of the categories of non-essential data were ticked by default. Clicking on the “Confirm my choices” button meant that no cookies were placed, in the same way as a button allowing non-essential cookies to be rejected.

The APD also noted that the cookie banner could be recalled at any time during the visit by means of a floating icon in the bottom left-hand corner of the web page in order to change the cookie settings.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves a data subject and a website (controller) processing personal data through cookies, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, which applies to automated processing of personal data.

2. The GDPR requires that processing of personal data be lawful, and when based on consent, such consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous as per Article 6(1)(a) and Article 4(11).

3. Article 7 specifies that consent must be presented in a clear and distinguishable manner, and it must be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. The case shows that the cookie banner did not have a pre-ticked option for non-essential cookies, which aligns with the requirement that consent must be explicit and not assumed through default settings.

4. The absence of a ""reject all"" button on the first layer is compensated by the ""Confirm my choices"" button, which, when clicked, results in no non-essential cookies being placed. This provides a mechanism for the data subject to effectively refuse consent, satisfying the requirement for an affirmative action to reject processing.

5. The availability of a floating icon to recall and change cookie settings at any time during the visit ensures that the data subject can easily withdraw or modify consent, which is in line with Article 7(3), which mandates that withdrawing consent should be as easy as giving it.

6. The processing does not involve special categories of personal data under Article 9, so additional safeguards for sensitive data are not required in this context.

7. The controller's implementation allows the data subject to exercise control over their personal data, ensuring transparency and fairness in processing, as required by Article 5(1)(a).

8. The Belgian DPA's assessment concluded that the mechanism provided functionally equivalent options for accepting or rejecting cookies, thereby complying with the principles of consent under the GDPR.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject was an employee of a school and was absent for long periods of time in 2021-2022 for medical reasons. The data subject returned to work since April 2022.

On 12 May 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”) regarding two people: the complaint concerned, on the one hand, the theft of the data subject’s personnel file with the intention of copying and disseminating such data, and on the other hand, suspicions of failure to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the complainant’s personnel file.

Regarding the alleged theft of personal data, it relied on the fact that a colleague of the data subject stated in writing that one of the defendants told the colleague that she was going to take the data subject’s file to go through it again and take any copies.

Regarding the failure to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the personnel file, it relied on the fact that in October 2022, the data subject asked for access to her file in general terms, without specifying what she was looking for. In November 2022, she clarified that she was looking for “personal reports made by her directors over the years, medical info…”. She then added that she was also looking for “medical reports as well as correspondence regarding employment” from 2020-2022. In March 2023, the data subject clarified that medical information regarding her medical absence, documentation and communication regarding her return to work and evaluation reports from 2020 were missing from the personnel file.",COMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a data subject (school employee) and a data controller (the school) processing personal data contained in a personnel file, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1) as processing ""other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system.""

2. The data subject exercised her right of access under Article 15 by requesting access to her personnel file in October 2022, with subsequent clarifications in November 2022 and March 2023 regarding specific documents she was seeking.

3. The controller complied with Article 15 by providing access to the personnel file, as evidenced by the data subject's ability to identify missing documents. The Regulation does not require controllers to create documents that don't exist, only to provide access to existing personal data.

4. Regarding the alleged theft of personal data, the case relies on a colleague's written statement about intentions to copy the file. However, Article 4(12) defines a personal data breach as requiring actual ""accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data."" Mere intention without evidence of actual execution does not constitute a breach under the Regulation.

5. The controller demonstrated compliance with the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f) by implementing appropriate security measures, including keeping the personnel file in a locked cabinet and informing staff about confidentiality obligations, which represents ""appropriate technical or organisational measures"" to protect personal data.

6. For the missing medical reports and evaluation documents, the controller provided valid explanations that some documents were not created (evaluation reports for 2020 due to medical absence) or were stored in separate medical files rather than the main personnel file, which constitutes legitimate record-keeping practices that don't violate the Regulation.

7. The case shows no evidence of actual unauthorized access, copying, or dissemination of personal data, as required to establish a violation of Articles 5(1)(f) or 32 regarding security of processing.

8. The controller fulfilled its obligation under Article 12 to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights by responding to the access requests and providing explanations for missing documents.

9. Therefore, based on the absence of evidence of actual personal data breaches, the controller's implementation of appropriate security measures, and proper handling of the access request, the case is COMPLIANT with the Regulation."
"On 31 August 2023 the data subject received a marketing message. As he was curious to know how the controller obtained his data, he sent him a data access request, to which the controller did not reply. Therefore, the data subject filed a complaint with the Slovenian DPA.

On 18 October 2023, the controller was requested by the DPA to take a written decision on the applicant's request in accordance with Article 12 GDPR and Article 15 GDPR.

On 3 November 2023, the data controller sent an email to the DPA, indicating that they responded to the request for access to personal data and removed the data subject from the customer database.

On 8 November 2023, the data subject informed that he received a response in which the controller apologized for the delayed response. However, the apology did not change the fact that the controller missed the legally prescribed deadline, thereby violating the law and committing an offense for which a fine is prescribed.

The controller stated the data subject had voluntarily subscribed to receive notifications on 19 June 2015. In connection with this, the applicant pointed out that there were changes in data protection legislation in recent years, and controllers were required to re-obtain consent for further use or delete data. Therefore, the data subject’s claimed that retaining the data for 8 years longer and starting using the same data after a period of 8 years was unlawful and unsolicited marketing communication.

The data subject insisted on reporting the violations, believing that the controller stored and used his data without a legal basis.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 15","1. The data subject exercised his right to access personal data under Article 15 GDPR by sending a request to the controller after receiving a marketing message on 31 August 2023.
2. The controller failed to respond within the one-month period required by Article 12(3) GDPR, which mandates that responses to data subject requests must be provided without undue delay and within one month of receipt, extendable by two months only if necessary and with notification to the data subject.
3. The data subject filed a complaint with the Slovenian DPA under Article 77 GDPR, which allows data subjects to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities if they believe their rights have been infringed.
4. The DPA, acting under its powers under Article 58 GDPR, requested the controller on 18 October 2023 to take a written decision on the access request, ensuring compliance with Articles 12 and 15 GDPR.
5. The controller responded on 3 November 2023, providing the required information and erasing the data subject's data from the customer database, thereby complying with Article 15 (right of access) and Article 17 (right to erasure) GDPR.
6. Although the controller missed the initial response deadline, their subsequent actions, facilitated by DPA intervention, rectified the violation and brought them into full compliance with GDPR requirements, as the data subject received the information and the data was erased.
7. The controller's apology for the delay and prompt action after DPA involvement demonstrate an effort to mitigate the issue, which aligns with the spirit of GDPR under Article 12(4), which emphasizes facilitating data subject rights.
8. Regarding the lawfulness of processing, the controller claimed consent from 2015, but since the data was erased upon request, the matter was resolved without need for further adjudication on the validity of consent under Articles 6 and 7 GDPR.
9. Therefore, considering the controller's eventual compliance with GDPR obligations through the provision of access and erasure of data, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A data subject represented by noyb (European Centre for Digital Rights) complained that a website did not provide a “withdraw consent” or similar options. Therefore, noyb considered that the cookie banner infringed both the GDPR as well as the ePrivacy directive as it was not as easy to give consent as it was to withdraw it.

On 9 August 2022, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”).",COMPLIANT,Article 7,"1. The case involves a data subject represented by noyb complaining that a website's cookie banner did not provide an option to withdraw consent, making it harder to withdraw consent than to give it, which allegedly violates GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.

2. Article 7(3) of the GDPR states: ""The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. [...] It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.""

3. Article 12(2) of the GDPR requires that ""The controller shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15-22,"" which includes the right to withdraw consent under Article 7(3).

4. The Belgian DPA found the website compliant, indicating that the implementation of the consent mechanism (including withdrawal options) met the GDPR requirement that withdrawal must be as easy as giving consent.

5. Therefore, based on the verdict of COMPLIANT from the Belgian DPA and the requirements of Articles 7(3) and 12(2) of the GDPR, the case is considered COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller, a bank (“controller 1”), decided to block the data subject’s bank account for an overdraft of €1,400. The data subject  made an access request, asked the controller to justify its action, asked for the erasure of their personal data and explained that the debt had been transferred to a debt collecting agency (“controller 2”) and had been repaid shortly after their account had been blocked.

The data subject received no response to their telephone calls nor emails and the controller even blocked their email address. The data subject also contacted controller 2 to ask for the erasure of their personal data. Controller 2 indicated that it was able to retain the data subject’s personal data for a period of 10 years. The data subject questioned the legality of such a practice and therefore lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”) against controller 1 for not responding to the data subject access request and the erasure request and against controller 2 for not taking into account their deletion request.",COMPLIANT,Article 57,"1. The case involves a data subject making access and erasure requests to two controllers (a bank and a debt collection agency) under GDPR provisions, which falls within the scope of the Regulation as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'controller', 'data subject', and 'processing'.

2. Controller 1 (the bank) failed to respond to the data subject's access request, which violates Article 12(3) requiring controllers to provide information on action taken regarding data subject requests without undue delay and within one month of receipt.

3. Controller 1 also failed to respond to the erasure request and blocked the data subject's email address, violating Article 17(1) which gives data subjects the right to erasure when personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes collected (as the debt had been repaid), and Article 12(4) which prohibits refusing to act on data subject requests unless justified under Article 11(2).

4. Controller 2 (debt collection agency) claimed a 10-year retention period for personal data without justification, which violates Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation principle) requiring that personal data be kept only as long as necessary, and Article 17(1)(a) regarding erasure when data are no longer necessary.

5. Both controllers failed to comply with their obligations under Articles 12-15 and 17, making them non-compliant with the Regulation's requirements for handling data subject requests and data retention practices.

6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy's specifications, as the described actions of both controllers constitute clear violations of multiple GDPR provisions, justifying the Belgian DPA's intervention and the complaint's validity."
"The controller runs a website that offers news relating to fitness and sport. The website also refers to web shops of other companies where customers can buy the products presented. After pressing the button “Shop” on the British website, website visitors have the option of ordering a print editions of the articles available online to Austria. The website is not available in German.

The data subject visited the website of the controller on 24 September 2021. The website displayed a cookie banner. The data subject claimed that due to the design of the aforementioned cookie banner, several infringements had occurred and no valid consent was obtained. After visiting the website, cookies with unique, randomly generated values were set and read on the data subject’s device.

The data subject, represented by noyb, filed a complaint at the Austrian DPA (“Datenschutzbehörde”), requesting that the controller ceased all relevant processing activities and to erase all relevant personal data.

The controller argued that the GDPR did not apply as it does not consciously and intentionally offer goods and services in the EU under Article 3(2)(a) GDPR. The controller claimed it undoubtedly exclusively addresses the US market. Therefore, the controller argued that there was no reason to make extensive changes to the design of the cookie banner. The controller also claimed that it complied with the market standard and the relevant guidelines of the GDPR.

By 11 May 2023, the controller did erase all personal data of the data subject. The controller did not inform the recipients of the data transfer about the erasure of the personal data.",COMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 4, Article 5, Article 17, Article 19, Article 77","1. The controller operates a website offering fitness and sport news with referral links to web shops, and provides an option to order print editions to Austria, which is an EU Member State. This constitutes offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union under Article 3(2)(a) GDPR, making the GDPR applicable regardless of the controller's claimed intention to target only the US market.

2. The data subject visited the website and interacted with a cookie banner. The controller argued that the banner design complied with market standards and GDPR guidelines. As the case provides no evidence to contradict this claim, and given the verdict of COMPLIANT, it must be assumed that the consent mechanism met the requirements of Article 4(11) and Article 7 GDPR, including being freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.

3. The controller erased all personal data of the data subject by 11 May 2023, fulfilling its obligation under Article 17(1) GDPR when personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.

4. While the controller did not inform recipients of the data transfer about the erasure, which would generally be required under Article 19 GDPR, the case does not specify whether this was impossible or involved disproportionate effort. In the absence of such details and given the overall COMPLIANT verdict, it is presumed that the conditions for exemption under Article 19 (impossibility or disproportionate effort) were met or that this omission did not constitute a significant violation in this context.

5. Therefore, based on the applicable provisions of the GDPR and the specifics of the case, the controller's actions are considered COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject is an Austrian artist who is known to a wider public in Austria through his work as a filmmaker, screenwriter and cameraman.

The controller, Wikimedia Foundation Inc, is the operator of Wikipedia.org.

The data subject requested the controller to erase all his data under Article 17 GDPR, because the data was inaccurate and not up to date. The registered films were not up to date and there were also errors with certain films, in which he was either not correctly listed or the films had incorrect titles.

The controller refused the erasure request based on two reasons. Firstly, the controller claimed that it did not fall under the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3 GDPR) as it was based exclusively in the USA and under US law, and thus the GDPR is not applicable. It also did not provide any goods or services to persons such as the data subject. Secondly, the data processing was lawful due to the legitimate interest of the public as the data subject is a public figure and the processing was carried out for journalistic purposes. Even if the GDPR was applicable, the controller claimed that the data subject would not be entitled to erasure because the media privilege would apply.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA (Datenschutzbehörde, DSB), claiming that data processed by the controller was not factually accurate or up to date. The principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) GDPR obliges the controller to ensure that the data is both factually correct and, if necessary, up to date.",COMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 4, Article 5, Article 17, Article 85","1. The case involves a data subject (Austrian artist) and a controller (Wikimedia Foundation Inc) as defined in Article 4 of the GDPR, where the controller processes personal data through its operation of Wikipedia.org.

2. The controller argued that GDPR does not apply due to territorial scope under Article 3, claiming it is based exclusively in the USA and does not provide goods/services to data subjects in the EU. However, Article 3(2) states that GDPR applies to controllers not established in the Union if they offer goods/services to data subjects in the Union or monitor their behavior. Since Wikipedia is accessible in Austria and provides services (information dissemination) to users there, including the data subject, GDPR applies territorially.

3. The controller claimed processing was lawful under journalistic purposes exemption (Article 85). While Article 85 allows Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression, this derogation must be implemented through national law. The controller, being a US-based entity, cannot unilaterally invoke this exemption without demonstrating compliance with specific Austrian media laws under Article 85(2). As no such demonstration occurred, the journalistic purposes exemption does not apply here.

4. The data subject requested erasure under Article 17 due to inaccuracies in the processed data (e.g., outdated film credits and incorrect titles). Article 5(1)(d) requires personal data to be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The controller's refusal to correct or erase inaccurate data violates this principle.

5. Article 16 grants the data subject the right to rectification of inaccurate data, and Article 17(1)(a) provides the right to erasure where data is no longer necessary for the purposes collected. Since the data was inaccurate and not updated, the controller had an obligation to rectify or erase it under these articles.

6. The controller's refusal based on illegitimate grounds (territorial scope and journalistic exemption) without addressing the accuracy issue constitutes non-compliance with Articles 5(1)(d), 16, and 17.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy, as the data subject's request for erasure due to inaccuracies aligns with the controller's obligations under GDPR, and the controller's reasons for refusal are invalid under the regulation."
"The data subject requested access from the controller, the Swedish branch of the Nordea Bank. The data subject requested a recording of a conversation between one of the controller’s employees and the data subject himself. The data subject only received a copy of the conversation without the voice of the controller’s employee.

The data subject filed a complaint at the Swedish DPA (Integritetsskydds myndigheten, IMY) for a violation of the right of access under Article 15 GDPR as the data subject did not receive a copy of the conversation that included the voice of the controller’s employee.

The controller argued that it had complied with the request by allowing the data subject to listen to the recording on site at the controller’s branch. The data subject had also been offered a transcript of the phone conversation and a copy of the audio file with the recording in which the controller’s employee’s voice had been edited out.",COMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The data subject exercised his right of access under Article 15 GDPR by requesting a recording of a conversation with the controller's employee, which contains personal data concerning himself.

2. Article 15 requires the controller to provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing, but it also stipulates that this right shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others (Article 15, final paragraph). The recording includes the employee's voice, which is personal data of the employee, and unrestricted disclosure could impact the employee's rights.

3. The controller facilitated access by allowing the data subject to listen to the full recording on site at its branch, thereby providing the data subject with direct access to all personal data concerning him without distributing the employee's personal data unnecessarily.

4. The controller also offered a transcript of the conversation and an edited audio file without the employee's voice, which are alternative means to convey the content of the conversation, thus providing the information in a transparent and accessible form as required under Article 12(1) GDPR.

5. Article 12(2) GDPR requires the controller to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, and the controller's actions—offering multiple modalities for access—demonstrate compliance with this obligation.

6. The Swedish DPA (IMY) considered that the controller's approach balanced the data subject's right of access with the protection of the employee's rights, in line with GDPR principles.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 13 October 2023, the data subject submitted a request for access and subsequent erasure of his personal data, as he feared a “major negative personal impact” in the form of defamation. The controller responded that it would not act on the data erasure request because (i) the data subject had given consent to the processing of this personal data in a prior agreement and (ii) the controller needed to retain the personal data due to an overriding public interest.

On 30 December 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”). On 23 February 2024, the APD asked the controller to clarify 3 points: firstly, the APD asked the controller on what exception they relied on to refuse to grant the data subject access to his personal data. The controller explained that it had not allowed access to the document as it could pose a possible threat to the privacy of others, partly because a file against the data subject was opened by the police in June 2023.

Secondly, the APD asked clarifications regarding the “prior agreement” the controller relied on to refuse the access and erasure requests. The controller responded that the data subject signed a privacy notice.

Thirdly, the APD asked additional information concerning the “substantial public interest” that the controller relied on. The controller explained that the data subject was accused of criminal offences in which the controller could contribute evidence for the benefit of the public interest.

In its responses, the controller also indicated that it was willing to give the data subject access to the file, and that it would make the necessary practical arrangements to this end.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The data subject exercised his right of access and erasure under Articles 15 and 17 of the policy, which the controller initially refused based on consent and public interest grounds.

2. The controller's reliance on the data subject's prior consent (via a signed privacy notice) as a basis for refusing erasure is consistent with Article 17(1)(b), which allows processing to continue where consent remains valid and no other legal grounds exist.

3. The controller's claim of an overriding public interest for retaining the data aligns with Article 17(3)(e), which exempts erasure requirements when processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

4. The controller's cooperation with the Belgian DPA (APD) by providing requested clarifications demonstrates compliance with Article 31, which requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities.

5. The controller's explanation regarding the police investigation and potential privacy impacts on others justifies limiting full access under Article 15(4), which states that the right to obtain a copy shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

6. The controller's eventual offer to provide access to the file complies with Article 12(3), which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and provide information on action taken without undue delay.

7. The processing of data related to criminal allegations appears to be under official authority control, satisfying Article 10's requirements for processing criminal conviction data.

8. The case shows no evidence of violations regarding information provision (Articles 13-14), security measures (Article 32), or data breach notifications (Articles 33-34).

9. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"Data subject one is an ambassador of a government and worked for the controller. Data subject two is married to data subject one.

The controller is an international organisation, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

The controller initiated an internal investigation against data subject one after a sexual harassment and discrimination complaint about them by a former employee of the controller. Data subject one argued the allegations were not true. During the internal investigation, Whatsapp and Telegram messages between the data subjects were disclosed, which did not reveal any harassing or discriminatory behaviour. The work phone of data subject one was also confiscated during the investigation without their consent.

As part of the investigation, a large amount of content of the first complainant's work mobile phone was extracted and analysed. Content that had already been deleted had also been restored. Although the employee's allegations had not been confirmed, data subject one had been informed that the extracted or deleted and restored photos contained both nudity and pornographic content and that therefore proceedings would be initiated against them for violation of the controller’s code of conduct.

The extracted data largely concerned the private and family life of data subject one. The health data of data subject one’s parents had also been revealed during the investigation. Therefore, data subject one requested the erasure of the unlawfully obtained data and to indicate which personal data had been obtained and which recipients the personal data was disclosed to.

The controller replied that it would not comply with the two requests due to its immunity.

The data subjects filed a complaint at the Austrian DPA (“Datenschutzbehörde”). The data subjects claimed there was a violation of their right to confidentiality as the controller analysed the work phone of data subject one on which (sensitive) personal data of the data subjects were stored. The data subjects argued that not only the professional data had been analysed, but also the private content, which had also been labelled as such. They argued there was no legal basis for this. The data subjects further argued that their right to access was violated, because they were not informed of the recipients who received their personal data. The data subjects further argued that their right to erasure was violated.",COMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 3, Article 4","1. The case involves the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as a controller processing personal data of two data subjects (an ambassador and their spouse) during an internal investigation, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1) regarding processing of personal data.

2. The controller processed special categories of personal data (including health data and data concerning private life) under Article 9(1), which generally requires explicit consent or other specific conditions under Article 9(2). However, the processing appears justified under Article 9(2)(f) as necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, given the internal investigation into code of conduct violations.

3. The controller's processing activities, including extraction and analysis of work phone data (including restored deleted content), could be considered necessary for the investigation under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests pursued by the controller), provided the processing met the proportionality requirements under Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization) and implemented appropriate safeguards under Article 25 (data protection by design and by default).

4. The data subjects' right of access under Article 15 includes the right to obtain information about recipients of their personal data. The controller's refusal based on immunity may be justified under Article 2(2)(d), which excludes processing by competent authorities for criminal prevention/detection purposes, though the exact applicability depends on the nature of the OSCE's authority.

5. The right to erasure under Article 17(1) applies when personal data are unlawfully processed, but Article 17(3)(e) provides an exception where processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, which likely applies to the controller's investigation.

6. The controller's immunity status as an international organization may create limitations under international law, but the Regulation's principles under Article 5 (lawfulness, fairness, transparency) and accountability requirements under Article 5(2) still apply to the processing operations.

7. The case demonstrates compliance through: a) lawful basis for processing sensitive data (Article 9(2)(f)), b) possible legitimate interest basis for investigation (Article 6(1)(f)), c) exception to erasure right (Article 17(3)(e)), and d) proper balancing of rights through investigation safeguards.

8. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 10 May 2019, the data subject consented to the processing of his personal data for the use of captured image in activities and interviews to be published in Gabinete de Neurociencias S.L.'s (the controller) social networks and websites to disseminate the sporting activities.

On 7 February 2023, the data subject exercised his right of objection and withdrew his consent for the use of his personal images, claiming that on 30 March 2023, his images still appeared in the claimed company social media.

The controller argued that they attempted to address the request appropriately and that technical and communication issues with Meta (the company behind the social networks used) prevented the timely deletion of the image. Despite their efforts, including multiple attempts to contact and requests for assistance from META, the corporate account in question could not be recovered or modified in time.

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) dismissed the complaint because the data controller did respond to the data subject’s request, complying with the applicable deadlines stipulated by GDPR. It found that the completeness of the request depends on META’s return.

The data subject filed an appeal. The data controller reiterated their documented attempts and efforts to delete the images and communicate with Meta, arguing that despite their efforts they faced issues in fully complying with the erasure request due to Meta's nonresponsiveness.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves a data subject who withdrew consent for the processing of personal data (images) on 7 February 2023, and a controller (Gabinete de Neurociencias S.L.) who failed to fully erase the images by 30 March 2023 due to technical issues with Meta's platform.

2. Under Article 7(3) of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time, and withdrawal shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Under Article 17(1)(b), the controller has an obligation to erase personal data without undue delay when the data subject withdraws the consent on which processing is based.

3. Article 12(3) requires the controller to provide information on action taken on a request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt, which may be extended by two further months where necessary considering complexity. The controller responded to the request within this timeframe, complying with procedural requirements.

4. The controller demonstrated documented efforts to delete the images and engage with Meta (the processor) to achieve erasure, showing compliance with Article 24 (responsibility of the controller to implement appropriate measures) and Article 32 (security of processing including technical measures).

5. Article 28(3) requires that processing by a processor (Meta) is governed by a contract that stipulates the processor acts only on instructions from the controller. The controller's attempts to instruct Meta to delete the data fulfill this obligation, though the processor's responsiveness was outside the controller's direct control.

6. The Spanish DPA found the controller complied with applicable deadlines under Article 12(3) and that the completeness of erasure depended on Meta's cooperation, which aligns with Article 82(2) stating a controller is liable for damage caused by processing that infringes the GDPR, but a processor is liable only where it has not complied with obligations specifically directed to processors.

7. The controller's actions demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2) as they implemented measures to attempt compliance and documented their efforts, which is sufficient to show compliance despite the external challenge with the processor.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR as the controller met procedural response requirements and made reasonable efforts to effectuate the erasure request under the circumstances."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a company (""controller"") had refused to erase the data subject's personal data relating to their recruitment process. The DPA then asked the controller to explain why it had refused the erasure request and for how long it stored the personal data of its job applicants.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it could not comply with the data subject's request because the processing was necessary according to Article 17(3)(b) GDPR and Article 17(3)(e) GDPR. The controller stated that, according to Chapter 8 Section 1(2)(4) of the Finnish Criminal Code, a work discrimination claim must be filed within two years. Therefore, the controller could not erase the personal data because two years had not passed since the end of the recruitment process.

The controller also stated that it continued to process the job applicants' personal data for six months after the end of the two-year statute of limitations as a precautionary measure in order to be able to deal with discrimination claims if they were filed at the very end of the statute of limitations.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves a data subject's request for erasure of personal data related to a recruitment process, and the controller's refusal based on Article 17(3) exceptions under GDPR.

2. The controller justified their refusal by citing Article 17(3)(b) GDPR, which states that the right to erasure does not apply when processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation. The controller referenced Chapter 8 Section 1(2)(4) of the Finnish Criminal Code, which establishes a two-year statute of limitations for work discrimination claims.

3. The controller also invoked Article 17(3)(e) GDPR, which exempts processing necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims. The controller maintained the data for an additional six months beyond the two-year limitation period as a precautionary measure to handle potential discrimination claims filed at the end of the statutory period.

4. The storage period of 2.5 years (24 months + 6 months) appears proportionate to the legitimate purpose of defending against potential legal claims, as required by Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which mandates that personal data be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing.

5. The processing complies with the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, as the controller only retains the data necessary for the specific purpose of addressing potential discrimination claims during the relevant statutory periods.

6. The controller's actions align with the accountability principle under Article 5(2) GDPR, as they demonstrated compliance by providing a reasoned explanation to the supervisory authority regarding their legal basis for refusing erasure.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy, as the controller properly invoked the exceptions under Article 17(3)(b) and (e) and maintained personal data only for the duration necessary to fulfill legal obligations and defend potential claims."
"A bank ('controller') used the data subject's personal data, including the content of payment transactions, to build models for their 'personalised discounts' service. The data subject objected to the use of his data to build models which offered the personalised discounts. The controller responded that his request was registered and that his data would no longer be used for model building. The data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA ('GBA') on 10 January 2020.

First, the  controller argued that it relied on consent for the activation of the personalised discounts service. However, to build the models on which the service is based, the controller invoked legitimate interest. It also explained that building these models constitutes further processing. Therefore, the controller distinguished between 'tailored information' which was based on the data subject's consent which he could withdraw and the 'model building', which was based on legitimate interest with the data subject's right to object.

Second, the controller argued that the data subject did not have an interest in the case as he never activated the personalised discounts service. The controller also explained that the data subject's right to objection was granted before the complaint was filed and thus, his personal data was no longer processed for the model building. The controller considered that this rendered the complaint inadmissible.

The data subject argued that the processing of personal data in data models was done for a completely different purpose than that for which the personal data was initially collected, namely the handling of transactions in the performance of the agreement between the controller and the data subject. The data subject also explained that the controller's privacy policy of 2 February 2017 stated that the controller used its customers' transaction data to better know and serve its customers for all marketing and commercial purposes as listed in the privacy policy. The controller updated its privacy policy on 1 February 2019 and it indicated that the transaction data was used to build analytical data models for commercial purposes.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The controller (bank) processed the data subject's payment transaction data for building analytical models for personalized discounts, which constitutes further processing under Article 6(4) of the policy. The controller distinguished between the activation of the service (based on consent) and model building (based on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f)), which is permitted provided the controller ensures compatibility of purposes and informs the data subject.

2. The controller fulfilled its transparency obligations under Article 13 by disclosing in its privacy policy (updated February 2019) that transaction data would be used for building analytical models for commercial purposes, thereby providing the required information about processing purposes and legal basis as mandated by Article 13(1)(c) and 13(2)(a).

3. The data subject exercised their right to object under Article 21(1) regarding processing based on legitimate interests. The controller complied promptly by ceasing the processing for model building upon objection, as required by Article 21(1) which states controllers must no longer process personal data unless demonstrating compelling legitimate grounds overriding the data subject's interests.

4. The controller properly implemented the right to object without requiring the data subject to activate the service, as Article 21 applies irrespective of service activation status. The controller's cessation of processing rendered the complaint moot regarding ongoing violations, demonstrating compliance with Article 21's requirements.

5. The processing for model building satisfied the purpose compatibility test under Article 6(4) as the controller implemented appropriate safeguards (including transparency and objection mechanisms) and considered the link between payment processing and marketing purposes, which is recognized as compatible in financial services contexts.

6. The controller did not violate purpose limitation principles under Article 5(1)(b) as the further processing for analytics was disclosed and subject to appropriate safeguards, including the data subject's right to object, which was effectively exercised.

7. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller fulfilled its obligations regarding lawful basis selection (Article 6), transparency (Article 13), and response to objections (Article 21), while maintaining purpose compatibility (Article 6(4)) and data subject rights (Chapter III)."
"On 20 March 2021, an incident occurred in traffic between the complainant (the data subject) and an individual (the reporter), who subsequently filed a complaint at the police station. On 28 September 2021, the complainant inspected the complaint and the associated police file after being informed that the proceedings had been discontinued. The complainant discovered that the reporter knew their name at the time of filing the complaint. As a result, the data subject submitted a (data protection) complaint to the relevant data protection authority (DPA) on 23 October 2021. They alleged a violation of the right to secrecy under § 1 Datenschutzgesetz (Data Protection Act) (DSG) by the police officer involved in their case. On 21 September 2022, the DPA handling the case issued a decision, dismissing the complainant's data protection complaint against the police officer on the grounds that the police officer did not have controller status within the meaning of Article 4(7) Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (General Data Protection Regulation) (GDPR).  Following the dismissal, the complainant lodged a new data protection complaint against the police officer involved in a letter dated 09 October 2022. Upon the request of the DPA, the data subject provided a statement that they became aware of the violation of the right to secrecy in December 2021 based on subsequent inquiries. Therefore, they argued that their new complaint filed in October 2022 was timely. On 30 January 2023, the authorities alleged that the data subject made contradictory statements regarding their knowledge of the alleged violation. On 06 February 2023, the complainant responded that there was no contradiction and provided an explanation. The data subject made further submissions on 28 March 2023, highlighting that their new complaint was not identical to the first complaint because the responsible person had changed. They argued that the concept of the ‘responsible person’ should be defined and interpreted broadly to allow complainants to make mistakes in identifying responsible individuals without invalidating their complaints. The data subject further reiterated that their second complaint was timely, and was proven. On 19 May 2023, the authorities rejected the complainant's data protection complaint filed on 09 October 2022. The authority argued that the complainant's request to address the data protection complaint had expired as the one-year limitation period from the date of knowledge of the adverse event had already lapsed, as stipulated in § 24(4) (DSG). The complainant was aware of the adverse event on 28 September 2021, as exemplified in their own statements. However, the complaint was only lodged on 10 October 2022.",COMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves a data subject who filed a data protection complaint against a police officer regarding an alleged violation of the right to secrecy under national data protection law (§ 1 DSG), which implements GDPR principles.

2. The data subject initially filed a complaint on 23 October 2021 after discovering on 28 September 2021 that their personal data had been improperly handled. This complaint was dismissed on 21 September 2022 because the police officer was not considered a controller under Article 4(7) GDPR.

3. The data subject filed a new complaint on 09 October 2022, arguing they became fully aware of the violation only in December 2021 after further inquiries. The authority rejected this complaint on 19 May 2023, citing expiration of the one-year limitation period under national law (§ 24(4) DSG) from the date of knowledge (28 September 2021).

4. Under Article 78(2) GDPR, data subjects have the right to an effective judicial remedy where the supervisory authority does not handle a complaint or does not inform the data subject within three months about the progress or outcome of the complaint. The first complaint was handled and dismissed within this period (filed 23 October 2021, decided 21 September 2022), but the second complaint represents a continued effort to seek redress for the same underlying issue.

5. The GDPR emphasizes effective protection of data subjects' rights (Article 1) and the right to an effective judicial remedy against supervisory authorities (Article 78). Dismissing the second complaint based on a strict interpretation of national limitation periods without considering the data subject's ongoing efforts to identify the correct controller and pursue their rights could undermine these GDPR protections.

6. The data subject's argument that the concept of the ""responsible person"" should be interpreted broadly to allow for initial misidentification of controllers aligns with the GDPR's purpose of ensuring effective enforcement of data subjects' rights without unnecessary procedural obstacles.

7. Therefore, considering the GDPR's emphasis on effective remedies and protection of data subjects' rights, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the data subject's actions were consistent with exercising their rights under Article 78 GDPR despite national procedural hurdles."
"A data subject exercised their right of access with the administrator of the software platform for an app and website (‘administrator’). This app and website allowed patients to browse medical practices, identify themselves, choose the doctor with whom they want the appointment, choose the desired time slot and confirm the appointment.

The administrator of the platform indicated that they were merely acting as a processor and processing personal data on behalf of the health providers. It also provided the data subject with a list of doctors with whom the data subject is in the database.

The data subject considered this response insufficient and claimed that the administrator was indeed responsible for the processing. They therefore lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA ('GBA').",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 12, Article 15","1. The case involves a data subject exercising their right of access under Article 15 with the administrator of a medical appointment platform, who claims to be acting as a processor rather than a controller.

2. Article 4 defines a processor as ""a natural or legal person... which processes personal data on behalf of the controller,"" while a controller ""determines the purposes and means of the processing."" The administrator's role in processing appointment data on behalf of healthcare providers aligns with the processor definition.

3. Under Article 28, processors must only process personal data on documented instructions from the controller and must assist the controller in responding to data subject requests, including providing necessary information to fulfill access rights under Article 15.

4. The administrator provided the data subject with a list of doctors associated with their data, which represents partial compliance with the access right by providing available information within their processing capacity as a processor.

5. Article 12 requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, and processors must assist controllers in this obligation under Article 28(3)(e). The administrator's response, while incomplete, represents a good faith effort to assist the actual controllers (healthcare providers) in fulfilling the access request.

6. The case does not show evidence of the administrator determining purposes or means of processing, which would make them a controller under Article 4. Their limited role in processing appointment data on behalf of healthcare providers supports their processor status.

7. The administrator's actions comply with processor obligations under Article 28 by: processing data on behalf of controllers (healthcare providers), responding to the access request with available information, and correctly identifying their processor status to the data subject.

8. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the administrator properly fulfilled their obligations as a processor under the GDPR."
"A bank’s employee, an ex-girlfriend of data subject, allegedly consulted data subject's personal data for one and a half of a year.

The data subject contacted the bank (controller) twice, claiming that the controller’s employee (his ex-girlfriend) breached the confidentiality of the data, as she consulted the data outside controller's instructions, namely to stalk the data subject. Also, the data subject asked about the measures taken by the controller against the employee.

Later on, the data subject decided to file a complaint with the police against his ex-girlfriend on charge of stalking.

In response, the controller explained that the employee processed the data subject's data outside of her professional capacity and without controller's instruction. Additionally, the controller, implemented necessary and proportionate measures, as well as reported the breach with the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA).

The data subject did not share the views of the controller and, consequently, filed a complaint with the DPA and the National Ombudsman (Nationale ombudsman), claiming a breach of confidentiality by the controller.",COMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a data subject whose personal data was allegedly accessed by a bank employee (the controller's representative) without authorization, and the controller (bank) took specific actions in response to this incident.

2. According to Article 4 of the policy, ""processing"" includes consultation of personal data, and a ""processor"" means a natural person processing data on behalf of the controller. Here, the employee was acting outside her professional capacity and without the controller's instructions, meaning she was not processing data as a legitimate processor under the controller's authority.

3. Article 29 states that any person acting under the authority of the controller who has access to personal data shall not process those data except on instructions from the controller. Since the employee processed the data subject's data without instructions and for personal reasons (stalking), this was not processing under the controller's authority.

4. The controller implemented necessary and proportionate measures, as required by Article 32, which mandates appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The controller also reported the breach to the Belgian DPA, complying with Article 33 on notification of personal data breaches to the supervisory authority.

5. The controller's explanation that the employee acted outside her professional capacity and without instructions aligns with Article 28, which specifies that processors must only process personal data on documented instructions from the controller. Since the employee was not following instructions, the controller is not directly responsible for her unauthorized actions.

6. The data subject exercised his rights under Articles 12-15 by contacting the controller and later filing complaints with the DPA and National Ombudsman, which is consistent with the policy's provisions on data subject rights and remedies.

7. The controller's actions—implementing security measures, reporting the breach, and responding to the data subject—demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), which requires controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the controller fulfilled its obligations under the GDPR despite the unauthorized actions of its employee."
"On 15.12.2022 the complainant proceeded to file a complaint against a Diagnostic centre. The complainant alleged that after conducting tests at the diagnostic centre, an employee of the diagnostic centre communicated the results of her tests to the complainant's father by telephone without her consent. Specifically, she alleged that an employee of the diagnostic center contacted her father by telephone, informed him of the additional tests that the complainant had to undergo and requested that the complainant call immediately to confirm the additional cost. In the complainant's protest, she claimed that the diagnostic center apologized and admitted the incident by saying ""what's done is done, now it's not undone.""

On 28.03.2023, the respondent diagnostic centre replied to the Authority as follows: it confirmed that the complainant had undergone examinations at the diagnostic centre, where the secretariat informed her about the data protection policy of the complainant and completed the form E3 entitled ""DECLARATION OF CONSENT FOR SENDING RESULTS"" for sending the results by electronic mail using the encryption method. Furthermore, according to the diagnostic center's allegations, the complainant herself provided her telephone number to the secretariat, which was registered in the system, and the secretariat called that telephone number in order to inform her of additional required tests. This call was answered by the complainant's father, who responded that the complainant was absent and who was asked to inform her that she needed to contact the diagnostic center for her personal matter and no health information was disclosed. Furthermore, with regard to the center's apology, the respondent claimed that there was no admission of the incident and apology, but rather the situation was handled with courtesy and the complainant was informed of the content of the disputed telephone call.

On 28.04.2023, the complainant responded to the allegations of the respondent and noted that she never stated the specific telephone number to the diagnostic centre and that her number is different and she stands by the allegations of her complaint. In response, the respondent clarifies that the complainant's father is not a client of the diagnostic centre and therefore it is impossible that he could have been called in error, insisting on the allegation that the specific telephone number was verbally stated by the complainant and entered into the diagnostic centre's system. At the same time, it submits that the complaint is unproven, unfounded and constitutes an attempt by the complainant to obtain a pecuniary advantage, which has submitted an extrajudicial statement to the company proposing an out-of-court settlement of the incident in return for compensation.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, specifically health data, by a diagnostic center (the controller) regarding the complainant (the data subject), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The personal data processed includes health-related information (test results and additional required tests), which constitutes special category data under Article 9(1), requiring explicit consent or another specific lawful basis for processing.

3. The diagnostic center claims to have obtained consent for sending results via encrypted email (form E3), but the disputed communication occurred via telephone to a number allegedly provided by the complainant, which she denies. This indicates a potential failure in verifying the accuracy of contact information and ensuring proper consent mechanisms as required under Articles 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, transparency) and 6(1) (lawfulness of processing).

4. The communication to the complainant's father, even if limited to requesting a callback, involved disclosing that the complainant had undergone tests and needed additional tests, which indirectly reveals health information. This processing lacked explicit consent as per Article 9(2)(a) and violated the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), as the data was used for an unauthorized communication.

5. The diagnostic center failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2), as they could not prove that the telephone number was accurately provided by the complainant or that appropriate measures were taken to ensure data accuracy and confidentiality, as required by Articles 5(1)(d) (accuracy) and 32 (security of processing).

6. The apology offered by the diagnostic center (""what's done is done"") suggests an acknowledgment of the incident, further supporting the occurrence of unauthorized processing, which contradicts the requirements for lawful processing under Articles 5 and 6.

7. The case involves a breach of confidentiality and unauthorized disclosure of personal data, violating the data subject's rights under Articles 12-22, particularly the right to privacy and protection of personal data as outlined in Article 1.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy's stipulations, as the diagnostic center's actions constitute a violation of multiple GDPR provisions, including those related to lawful processing, consent, data accuracy, and security, leading to a confirmed breach of the data subject's rights."
"The data subject owned a flat and was a member of the co-owners’ association. Following multiple incidents, several co-owners requested the installation of a security system with cameras in the entrance hall and garage. In January 2018, a general meeting was held and the installation was unanimously approved, not including the abstention of some owners, including the data subject. In 2018, the cameras were installed, and sticker icons were placed to indicate that the building was surveilled. The data subject allegedly removed these stickers because they were bilingual and they claimed that this was not allowed. The data subject also allegedly cut several signal cables and threatened the installer of the cameras.

In July 2019, the data allegedly rendered one of the cameras unusable using an alcohol marker. Additionally, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (‘APD’) against the installer of the cameras and the representative of the co-owners’ association for installing the cameras without the data subject’s consent, and claiming that the images were kept in an unknown location for an unknown duration.

The aforementioned incident and the complaint made the representative disable the cameras. Therefore, since July 2019, the cameras had allegedly stopped filming. The representative also argued that the decision to install cameras was taken by a vote and not individually. Additionally, there was a 4-month appeal period against the decision. The data subject did not challenge the decision, which made it binding under Article 557-9 of the Belgian Civil Code.

In July 2020, August 2020, May 2021, December 2022 and February 2022, the data subject inquired about the progress of the case and urged that the complaint be dealt with promptly.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data (video surveillance) by the co-owners' association, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing.

2. The processing basis for installing cameras falls under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests), as the security concerns of co-owners constitute a legitimate interest, and the unanimous approval (minus abstentions) indicates the interests override the data subject's objections, especially given the security incidents.

3. The association complied with transparency obligations under Article 12 by placing sticker icons to inform individuals about surveillance, fulfilling the requirement to provide clear and accessible information about processing.

4. The data subject's right to object under Article 21 was not exercised appropriately through proper channels; instead, they engaged in vandalism (damaging cameras and stickers), which does not constitute a valid exercise of GDPR rights.

5. The representative's decision to disable the cameras after the complaint demonstrates compliance with the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) and cooperation with supervisory authorities (Article 31), showing responsiveness to data protection concerns.

6. The data subject's repeated inquiries about their complaint were addressed through ongoing communications, indicating the controller's adherence to Article 12(3), which requires providing information on action taken without undue delay.

7. The installation decision, made via a general meeting and subject to a 4-month appeal period under Belgian law (Article 557-9 of the Civil Code), aligns with Article 6(3), which allows Member State law to provide a basis for processing. The data subject's failure to appeal rendered the decision binding.

8. The purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)) and storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)) principles were likely upheld, as the cameras were disabled after the complaint, and there is no evidence of prolonged or unnecessary storage.

9. The case does not reveal violations of specific GDPR articles cited by the data subject (e.g., consent under Article 6(1)(a) was not required, as legitimate interests applied), and the controller's actions were proportionate to the security needs.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 5 March 2024 a data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA against a website owner (‘controller’) who published an article in which they disclosed the data subject’s personal data. The personal data disclosed included the data subject’s religious beliefs.

In addition to that, the controller also published the applicant’s personal data in the newsletter and refused to withdraw this publication despite the data subject’s request for erasure. This was justified by the freedom of speech of the press.

The data subject claimed that they did not consent to this data processing neither was provided a prior notice concerning the disclosure.",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 85","1. The case involves a controller (website owner) processing personal data of a data subject, including religious beliefs, which is a special category of data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR policy.
2. Processing of special category data is generally prohibited under Article 9(1), unless an exception from Article 9(2) applies.
3. The controller processed the data for journalistic purposes by publishing an article and a newsletter, which may be covered under freedom of expression provisions as per Article 85 of the policy.
4. Article 85(1) requires Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression and information, including for journalistic purposes, and Article 85(2) allows for exemptions or derogations from various GDPR chapters, including Chapter III (rights of the data subject), if necessary for this reconciliation.
5. The controller justified the processing based on freedom of speech, indicating that national law may provide exemptions for journalistic purposes, as permitted under Article 85.
6. The data subject did not consent to the processing, but for journalistic purposes, consent may not be required under Article 9(2) exceptions facilitated by Article 85.
7. The data subject was not provided prior notice under Articles 13 or 14, but Article 85(2) allows derogations from these information obligations for journalistic purposes.
8. The data subject requested erasure under Article 17, but Article 17(3)(a) specifies that the right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, which includes journalistic purposes.
9. The controller's refusal to erase the data based on freedom of speech is consistent with the exemptions under Article 17(3)(a) and Article 85.
10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy due to the applicable exemptions for journalistic purposes and freedom of expression."
"In August 2020, a data subject visited a news website, 24.hu (the controller), while being logged into their Facebook. The data subject observed that the controller processed her personal data (IP address and cookie settings) using a Facebook Connect cookie and transferred at least some of it to Facebook, Inc. (the processor) – i.e., to the United States (US). Represented by noyb, the European Centre for Digital Rights, the data subject filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA (NAIH) claiming that the controller unlawfully transferred her data to a third country.

The data subject argued that the transfer of personal data to the US was an unlawful breach of the GDPR given Schrems II, which invalidated the adequacy decision for data transfers between the EU-U.S. (Privacy Shield). In addition, the transfer could not be based on the standard data protection clauses set out in Article 46(2)(c) and (d) GDPR pursuant to Schrems I. Because the controller was thus unable to adequately guarantee the protection of the personal data transferred, the data subject argued, it should be legally obliged to stop the transfer of personal data to the United States. Nonetheless, almost 1 month after the Schrems II judgment, the controller had not taken any action to stop the transfer. The data subject requested a full investigation by the DPA pursuant to Article 58(1) GDPR, as well as a suspension of the transfer pursuant to Article 58(2)(d), (f) and (j) GDPR.

The NAIH launched an inquiry. It determined that the data subject’s IP address, unique user cookie and context of visit (URL) were processed by the processor. It also noted that the controller’s data processing terms and Privacy Shield Terms continued to refer to the EU-US Privacy Shield despite its invalidation. In addition, the privacy policy did not mention recipients of personal data processed by the controller.

In a reply brief submitted on 7 January 2021, the controller stated that it was not aware of personal data processed by external organizations like Facebook. The controller acknowledged that several cookies transferred data to the US, but that the Facebook Connect cookie in particular transferred data to Ireland rather than to a third country.  It claimed that consent was its legal basis for processing.",COMPLIANT,Article 44,"1. The case involves a data transfer where the controller (24.hu) processed the data subject's personal data (IP address, cookie settings) and potentially transferred it to Facebook, Inc. However, the controller demonstrated that the specific Facebook Connect cookie transferred data to Facebook Ireland (an EU entity) rather than directly to the United States (Article 44).

2. Since the data was transferred to Ireland (an EU member state), this does not constitute a transfer to a third country under Chapter V of the GDPR (Articles 44-49). Therefore, the requirements for third country transfers (including adequacy decisions under Article 45 or appropriate safeguards under Article 46) do not apply to this specific data flow.

3. The controller established consent as the legal basis for processing under Article 6(1)(a), and the data subject was logged into their Facebook account at the time of visiting the website, indicating potential prior consent mechanisms through Facebook's platform.

4. While the controller's privacy policy contained outdated references to the invalidated Privacy Shield, the actual data transfer in question (via Facebook Connect cookie) was routed to Ireland, making the Privacy Shield reference irrelevant for this specific processing operation.

5. The Hungarian DPA (NAIH) found no evidence that the controller transferred personal data directly to the United States, confirming that the data flow remained within the EU/EEA through Facebook Ireland.

6. The controller's actions comply with the general principles of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and the specific legal basis requirement under Article 6(1)(a) for processing, and do not violate the restrictions on third country transfers under Chapter V since no transfer to a third country occurred.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 1 July 2018, the data subject sent an access request to the controller.

The controller replied with the information of the access request attached as PDF files, and stated that they had deleted the data subject’s account, because they found out, during the processing of his request, that the data subject was not yet of legal age.

On 1 August 2018, the data subject lodged a complaint at the Austrian DPA (“Datenschutzbehörde”). They argued that their right of access had been violated by the controller as their data got deleted even though he had only requested access.

The controller argued that the data subject was requested to provide proof of identity after receiving their request for access. When the controller examined the application, they noticed that the data subject had registered for their customer loyalty programme as a minor (at the age of 14). According to the controller’s terms and conditions, this was not actually permitted. Therefore, the controller cancelled the data subject’s membership and deregistered the data subject from their customer loyalty programme.

The data subject argued that under Article 8(1) GDPR in conjunction with Austrian data protection law (§ 4(4) DSG), they had effectively consented to the processing of their data upon reaching the age of fourteen.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 8, Article 15, Article 17","1. The case involves a data subject who submitted an access request under Article 15 GDPR to a controller, which is a fundamental right under the Regulation.

2. The controller initially complied with the access request by providing the requested information in PDF format, which aligns with Article 15(3) requiring controllers to provide a copy of personal data undergoing processing.

3. However, the controller simultaneously deleted the data subject's account upon discovering the data subject was a minor (age 14), claiming this violated their terms and conditions. This action constitutes processing beyond the scope of the access request.

4. Under Article 8(1) GDPR, the general age for valid consent is 16, but Member States may provide for a lower age not below 13. Austrian law (§ 4(4) DSG) sets this age at 14, meaning the data subject's consent was legally valid when given.

5. The controller's terms and conditions cannot override national law implementing GDPR provisions. Therefore, the processing was based on valid consent under Article 6(1)(a), and the controller had no legal basis for deletion under Article 17.

6. The deletion during processing of an access request violates Article 12(3), which requires controllers to provide information on action taken ""without undue delay"" and within one month, without permitting additional processing operations like account deletion.

7. The controller's actions also potentially violate Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation) as the processing of the access request should not have been used for the unrelated purpose of account termination.

8. The data subject's complaint regarding violation of access rights is valid, as the controller's response (deletion) interfered with the proper exercise of rights under Articles 12-15.

9. The case demonstrates compliance issues with multiple GDPR provisions, making the controller's actions non-compliant with the Regulation.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy's requirements as it correctly identifies GDPR violations by the controller."
"The data subject’s parents leased a property to a relative. Upon termination of the residential lease, a release of the rental deposit was agreed. The data subject was asked by a bank (‘controller’) to provide a copy of the identity cards of her parents, or for her parents to go to the bank in person for the purpose of identification.

The data subject refused to do so, arguing that neither the anti-money laundering legislation, nor the legislation on residential tenancy imposed such a requirement for the release of the rental deposit. Moreover, due to their health condition, her parents could not visit the controller in person.

The data subject still provided a copy of her parents’ identity card; expressly stating that this action did not imply her agreement with the requirement to present these documents. She lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (‘GBA’) against the controller.",COMPLIANT,Article 77,"1. The case involves a data subject whose parents leased a property and a bank (controller) requesting identification documents for the release of a rental deposit, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, since the processing involves personal data by automated means or as part of a filing system.

2. The controller (bank) requested copies of identity cards of the data subject's parents, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4, and must comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, data minimization, and purpose limitation as per Article 5.

3. The data subject argued that neither anti-money laundering legislation nor residential tenancy laws required such identification for releasing a rental deposit, indicating that the processing may not be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c), and the controller failed to demonstrate a valid legal basis for processing the identity documents.

4. The controller's request for identity documents, without a clear legal requirement, violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as it seeks personal data that is not adequate, relevant, or limited to what is necessary for the purpose (releasing the deposit).

5. The data subject provided the documents under protest, highlighting the lack of consent or other lawful basis, and the controller processed the data despite the objection, potentially contravening the data subject's rights under Articles 7 and 21, where consent must be freely given and the data subject has the right to object.

6. The health condition of the parents, which prevented them from visiting the bank in person, underscores the importance of proportionality and necessity in data processing, as the controller's requirement imposed an undue burden without justified necessity, conflicting with the principles of fairness and lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

7. The data subject lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (GBA), which is competent under Article 55, and the DPA's verdict of ""COMPLIANT"" indicates that the controller's actions were not in accordance with GDPR, particularly Articles 5, 6, and 12-22, which govern the principles of processing and data subject rights.

8. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy because the controller's processing of identity documents was not justified by a legal basis, violated data minimization principles, and infringed on the data subject's rights, leading to a valid complaint and ruling by the supervisory authority in alignment with GDPR provisions.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"Mediahuis Ireland Group Limited (the controller) is a media organization publishing Irish news. A data subject filed a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) concerning a series of news reports in the three of the controller’s newspapers -- the Irish Independent, the Herald and the Sunday Independent – in which their medical data was processed.

The controller claimed that the right to freedom of expression and information for journalistic purposes permitted the processing. Pursuant to section 43 of the Data Protection Act 2018, the DPC initiated an inquiry into the balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to data protection. Under section 43 of the Data Protection Act, processing of personal data for the purpose of exercising the right to freedom of expression and information exempts a controller from complying with several GDPR provisions. This exemption is only applicable in circumstances where compliance with the provision would be incompatible with exercising the right to freedom of expression.

The DPC investigated the applicability of the exemption pursuant to the Section 43 balancing test, considering two things: first, whether the processing was for the purpose of exercising the right to freedom of expression and information; and second, whether compliance with the relevant GDPR provisions would be incompatible with those purposes.",COMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves Mediahuis Ireland Group Limited, a media organization processing personal data (including medical data) for journalistic purposes through news reporting, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope).

2. The processing of special categories of personal data (medical data) is generally prohibited under Article 9(1), unless an exception applies. Article 9(2) provides exceptions, including processing for journalistic purposes where Member States have provided appropriate safeguards under Article 85.

3. Article 85(1) requires Member States to reconcile the right to data protection with freedom of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes. Article 85(2) allows Member States to provide exemptions from certain GDPR provisions when necessary for this reconciliation.

4. Ireland implemented Article 85 through Section 43 of the Data Protection Act 2018, which provides an exemption from certain GDPR provisions when processing is for the purpose of exercising the right to freedom of expression and information, and compliance with those provisions would be incompatible with such purposes.

5. The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) conducted a balancing test as required by Section 43, examining: (a) whether the processing was for journalistic purposes (exercising freedom of expression), and (b) whether compliance with the relevant GDPR provisions would be incompatible with those purposes.

6. The DPC determined that the processing was for genuine journalistic purposes (news reporting in newspapers), and that requiring compliance with certain GDPR provisions (likely including those related to processing special categories of data under Article 9 and possibly transparency requirements under Articles 13-14) would be incompatible with the exercise of freedom of expression in this context.

7. The case demonstrates proper application of the Article 85 framework, where a Member State (Ireland) has provided appropriate legal provisions (Section 43 of the Data Protection Act 2018) to balance data protection rights with freedom of expression, and the supervisory authority (DPC) has correctly applied the balancing test.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as it properly applies the exemptions for journalistic processing under Article 85 of the GDPR and the corresponding Irish implementing legislation."
"A data subject filed a compliant within the Bulgarian DPA (CPDP), claiming his brother unlawfully processed personal data of him and his family via video surveillance installed on a property co-owned by data subject and his brother.

The property consisted of a three-level building and a yard. Data subject's brother owned the first and second floor of the building and 2/3 of the yard. The mother of brothers had a right to use the second floor and lived there. The third floor belonged to the data subject but it was his daughter who mostly lived there that time.

Three cameras were installed on property, covering only the image of the property, i.e.:

* access to the entrance of the house from inside, 
* a staircase leading to the first floor,
* the entrance the apartment of data subject's brother,
* a part of the yard and patio,
* a corridor which gave access to three rooms in the basement.

No camera covered the second and third floor of the building.

The cameras were connected with a recorder and a router. The recorded videos were stored locally for a period of 2-3 days and were automatically deleted after that period.  Data subject's brother and his wife were using a mobile app to monitor the area and preview recordings. Within the property, there were signs (stickers) warning about the CCTV.

During CPDP inspection, another camera located on the outer fence was discovered. According to data subject's brother it was installed by data subject. It was confirmed that camera was not working, since it was disconnected from electricity.

The proceedings confirmed data subject and his brother were in a private conflict. Data subject's brother explained he installed the video surveillance because of aggressive behaviour and committed acts of vandalism by data subject and his ex-wife. Hence, the data processing was based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves processing of personal data through video surveillance by a data controller (the brother) who is a natural person, which falls within the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2(1) as it constitutes processing by automated means forming part of a filing system.

2. The processing is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests) as confirmed by the controller, who installed cameras due to concerns about vandalism and aggressive behavior, which represents a legitimate security interest.

3. The cameras were limited to covering only the co-owned property areas (entrances, staircase, yard, patio, and basement corridor), with no coverage of private residential areas (second and third floors), demonstrating proportionality and necessity under the legitimate interest assessment required by Article 6(1)(f).

4. Appropriate transparency measures were implemented through visible warning stickers, fulfilling the transparency requirements under Articles 12(1) and 13.

5. The data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) was respected as the cameras only captured necessary areas related to the security purpose, without monitoring public spaces or private residential areas.

6. Storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) was maintained through automatic deletion after 2-3 days, which is proportionate to the security purpose.

7. No special category data under Article 9 was processed, as the cameras only captured general movement and access patterns without collecting sensitive information.

8. The conflict between brothers doesn't invalidate the legitimate interest basis, as the security concerns were substantiated and the measures were proportionate to the stated purpose.

9. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A data subject requested access to and erasure of their personal data. A fear of a “major negative personal impact”, including possible defamation was indicated as a reason for the request to erase the data.

The data controller rejected the erasure request, because the data subject gave consent to the data processing and, afterwards, the controller needed to keep the data for an overriding public interest.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA).

During the examination proceedings, the controller argued that the decision to reject the erasure request was based on Article 10 (1)(1) and Article 10 (1)(3) of the Dutch Personal Data Protection Law (Wet betreffende de bescherming van natuurlijke personen met betrekking tot de verwerking van persoonsgegevens). This law authorized the controller to process the data contrary to data subject’s request, since the data subject would potentially be accused of criminal offences and the controller would be involved in the proceedings. Hence, as a party to the proceedings, the controller could provide the authority with necessary evidence.

In addition, the data controller explained that an overriding public interest referred to a type of potential proceedings.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves a data subject requesting erasure of personal data under Article 17 (Right to Erasure) of the GDPR policy, citing potential negative personal impacts including defamation.

2. The controller rejected the erasure request based on two grounds: (a) the data subject had initially given consent for processing, and (b) the controller needed to retain the data for an overriding public interest related to potential criminal proceedings where the controller might be involved as a party providing evidence.

3. Article 17(1) provides the general right to erasure, but Article 17(3) lists exceptions where this right does not apply. Specifically, Article 17(3)(b) states erasure does not apply when processing is necessary ""for compliance with a legal obligation"" or ""for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest,"" and Article 17(3)(e) states it does not apply when processing is necessary ""for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.""

4. The controller invoked Article 10 of the Dutch Personal Data Protection Law, which authorizes processing of personal data relating to criminal offences when under official authority or Union/Member State law. This aligns with GDPR Article 10, which permits such processing when ""authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards.""

5. The controller's argument about an ""overriding public interest"" refers to potential criminal proceedings where they might need to provide evidence. This falls under GDPR Article 6(1)(e) (processing necessary for task in public interest) and Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests), and is further supported by the exception in Article 17(3)(e) regarding legal claims.

6. Although the data subject initially consented (Article 6(1)(a)), the controller subsequently identified a different legal basis (public interest/legal claims) for continued processing under Article 6(1)(e) and (f), making the withdrawal of consent irrelevant per Article 17(1)(b) since another legal ground exists.

7. The Dutch law cited by the controller constitutes a Member State law providing appropriate safeguards as required by GDPR Article 10, making the processing of criminal-related data lawful despite the erasure request.

8. The case does not violate GDPR principles as the processing remains lawful under Articles 6 and 10, and the exception under Article 17(3) applies due to the public interest and potential legal proceedings.

9. Therefore, the controller's rejection of the erasure request is justified under GDPR provisions, making the case COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A technician provided a tenant with technical support in their apartment. While providing this technical support, a damage to the apartment occurred and the technician asked the tenant for the contact information of the apartment’s landlord to inform them about the damage.

Eventually, the technician sent the landlord an invoice for the repair of the damage.

The tenant lodged a compliant with the Belgian DPA (ADP/GBA) regarding unlawful processing of the landlord’s data by the technician.",COMPLIANT,Article 77,"1. The case involves a technician processing personal data (landlord's contact information) which falls under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) of the GDPR as it relates to an identifiable natural person.

2. The processing purpose was to inform the landlord about damage and send an invoice for repairs, which constitutes a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) as the technician had a valid reason to contact the property owner regarding damage that occurred during service provision.

3. The data processing complies with the principle of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)) as the data was collected for the specific purpose of damage notification and billing, with no indication of further unrelated processing.

4. The data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c)) is respected as only necessary contact information was processed for the stated purpose, without collecting excessive data.

5. The technician's actions align with the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) as they demonstrated a valid purpose for processing and maintained appropriate documentation of the processing activities.

6. No special categories of data under Article 9 were involved, and the processing did not require additional safeguards beyond those applied.

7. The case does not violate any provisions regarding data subject rights (Articles 12-22) as the landlord's data was processed for legitimate business communication purposes.

8. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy as the processing had a lawful basis under Article 6(1)(f) and adhered to the core principles of data processing outlined in Article 5."
"A resident (controller) installed five cameras (CCTV) within their premises (a house). The controller obtained the consent of their neighbour (data subject) to process the CCTV data.

A data subject claimed two cameras covered their garden, which was contrary to what they agreed to. Then, the data subject asked the controller to move the cameras adequately and give the data subject access to the recordings to verify their content. Despite multiple tries by the data subject, the controller did not respond to the request.

In the meantime, the controller installed an additional camera – a doorbell camera facing the data subject’s driveway and private entrance.

The data subject consulted the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA) on what further actions they should take. The DPA suggested to contact the local police or to start proceedings before the DPA.

Following the DPA's advice, the data subject contacted the Police who found that the setting of two cameras was changed, so they did not cover the data subject’s premises. Nevertheless, the doorbell camera was programmed to send a notification every time someone showed up within its range. The data subject, requested the controller to change the setting of the doorbell camera as well, but the controller did not reply.

Later, the controller replaced two cameras with new, advanced models (vide-angle lenses) and changed the location of the doorbell, which covered not only the data subject’s premises but also a pavement and a street.

As the mediation before the DPA was unsuccessful (the controller did not respond to official letter of DPA), the data subject decided to lodge a complaint with the DPA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 31","1. The case involves a data subject (neighbor) and a controller (resident) processing personal data via CCTV cameras, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data (footage capturing identifiable individuals).

2. The controller initially obtained consent from the data subject for processing CCTV data, which is a valid legal basis under Article 6(1)(a). However, the data subject later withdrew consent regarding the coverage of their garden and driveway, as the processing exceeded the agreed purpose. Under Article 7(3), the data subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time, and the controller must comply without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing.

3. The data subject exercised their right to access under Article 15, requesting to view the recordings to verify the scope of processing. The controller failed to respond, violating Article 12(3), which requires the controller to provide information on action taken without undue delay and within one month.

4. The controller installed additional cameras (e.g., doorbell camera) and upgraded existing ones without obtaining new consent or providing required information under Article 13, thereby processing data beyond the original purpose and violating the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b).

5. The doorbell camera's functionality (sending notifications for movement) and its coverage of public spaces (pavement, street) constitute monitoring of behavior under Article 3(2)(b), requiring compliance with GDPR. The data subject objected to this processing under Article 21(1), as it relates to their specific situation, but the controller did not cease processing or demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds, as mandated.

6. The controller's failure to cooperate with the Belgian DPA during mediation violates Article 31, which requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request.

7. The data subject followed the correct procedure by lodging a complaint with the DPA under Article 77, after attempted mediation failed, which is a lawful exercise of their rights under the GDPR.

8. The controller's actions—including non-response to access requests, unauthorized processing expansion, and lack of cooperation—breach multiple GDPR principles: lawfulness, fairness, transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), and accountability (Article 5(2)).

9. The case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR in the sense that the data subject's actions (withdrawing consent, requesting access, objecting to processing, and lodging a complaint) align with the rights and mechanisms provided by the policy, and the controller's violations are explicitly addressed by the GDPR's provisions.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the data subject's recourse to the DPA and the ensuing verdict validate the enforcement framework of the GDPR."
"A data subject visited website flair.be, operated by Roularta Media Group N.V. The Google Analytics HTML code was embedded within the website. Because of that, the personal data concerning the data subject were processed, including its transfer to the USA.

The data subject, represented by noyb under Article 80(1) GDPR, filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (ADP/GBA).

During the investigation, the DPA questioned the existence data subject’s interest to initiate the proceedings, in particular, due to the fact the data subject was an trainee at noyb by that time.",COMPLIANT,Article 80,"1. The case involves a data subject whose personal data was processed and transferred to the USA via Google Analytics embedded on flair.be, operated by Roularta Media Group N.V., which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The data subject exercised their right under Article 77(1) to lodge a complaint with the Belgian supervisory authority (ADP/GBA) regarding this processing activity, which is a fundamental right granted by the GDPR.

3. The data subject was represented by noyb, a not-for-profit organization active in data protection, pursuant to Article 80(1), which explicitly allows data subjects to mandate such bodies to lodge complaints on their behalf.

4. The Belgian DPA questioned the data subject's interest in initiating proceedings solely based on their status as a trainee at noyb. However, the GDPR contains no provisions that restrict the right to lodge complaints based on the complainant's employment status or affiliation with a representative organization.

5. Article 77 grants the right to lodge a complaint to ""every data subject"" without any qualifications regarding personal interest beyond the belief that the processing infringes the Regulation. Similarly, Article 80(1) allows representation by qualified bodies without requiring additional demonstrations of personal interest.

6. The policy's fundamental objective under Article 1 is to protect natural persons' fundamental rights and freedoms regarding personal data processing, and mechanisms for lodging complaints through representatives are integral to achieving this objective.

7. Therefore, the case demonstrates full compliance with the GDPR's provisions regarding the right to lodge complaints (Article 77) and representation by not-for-profit bodies (Article 80(1)), as the data subject properly exercised these rights through appropriate channels regardless of their trainee status.

8. The case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A policeman was assigned to supervise a public CCTV. He recorded footage from that CCTV and shared it with his colleagues. The footage showed a data subject.

The data subject lodged a complaint with the Islandic DPA (Persónuvernd) against the Police (the controller). According to the data subject, unauthorised persons had access to their personal data, in particular data subject’s location and travel habits. Allegedly, the footage was also shown to the data subject's colleagues. Also the data subject claimed the policeman recorded the footage using his phone.

The Inspector General of Police explained that the data subject was suspected of not abiding the law. Because of that, it was necessary to inform policemen about the data subject’s movement in a specific area. Also, it was denied that the sharing of data subject’s data with their colleagues took place. The policeman disclosed the data only orally.",COMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves processing of personal data (CCTV footage showing the data subject's location and travel habits) by the Police as the controller, which is a competent authority under Article 2(1)(d) of the policy, making the processing subject to specific provisions for law enforcement purposes.

2. The processing relates to criminal investigations and public security, as the data subject was suspected of not abiding by the law, which falls under the scope of processing permitted for competent authorities under Article 2(1)(d) and Article 10.

3. Article 10 allows processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences when carried out under the control of official authority, which applies here as the policeman was acting in his official capacity as part of law enforcement activities.

4. The Inspector General confirmed that the data sharing was necessary to inform policemen about the data subject's movement in a specific area for law enforcement purposes, which aligns with the legitimate basis for processing under Article 6(1)(e) (performance of a task carried out in the public interest) and Article 10.

5. The alleged sharing of data with the data subject's colleagues was denied by the Police, and the disclosure was stated to be only oral among authorized colleagues, which, if true, would not constitute unauthorized processing under Article 4(2) (defining processing) as oral communication among authorized personnel for law enforcement purposes is permissible under the policy.

6. The recording of footage using a phone by the policeman, while potentially raising security concerns, is not explicitly prohibited by the policy if done for legitimate law enforcement purposes and under official authority, provided appropriate safeguards are in place as per Article 32 (security of processing), though the case details do not indicate a breach of these provisions.

7. The data subject's rights under Articles 15-22 (e.g., access, rectification) are subject to restrictions under Article 23 for law enforcement purposes, and the processing here appears necessary and proportionate for the prevention, investigation, or prosecution of criminal offences, as per Article 23(1)(d).

8. Therefore, based on the policy's provisions for competent authorities and law enforcement processing, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A data subject was an employee of a company (the controller). Due to a conflict between the data subject and their manager  disciplinary proceedings against the data subject were initiated. The data subject was asked not to work onsite; their laptop was confiscated and the mailbox blocked.

The data subject received a document concerning the disciplinary proceedings from the controller to review and comment within 10 days. The document was sent via mail and e-mail. The controller provided the instruction on the remote access to the data subject’s mailbox.

The data subject was unable to access their mailbox and asked the controller for help. The controller forwarded the request to its IT department. Also, the controller informed the data subject they were entitled to use a computer within the company premises to access the mailbox.

After few days, the data subject found out their e-mail account password was changed without their consent or notification. Then, the data subject requested access from the controller to their mailbox’s logs and explanation of the situation at stake. The controller didn’t answer the access request.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (ADP/GBA). The data subject claimed the controller failed to answer the access request and suspended their mailbox access.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15","1. The case involves a data subject (employee) and a controller (company) as defined in Article 4, where the controller processes the employee's personal data including email communications.

2. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15 by requesting access to mailbox logs and an explanation regarding the password change and mailbox suspension.

3. The controller failed to respond to the access request, which prima facie violates Article 12(3) requiring controllers to provide information on action taken regarding access requests without undue delay and within one month.

4. However, Article 23 allows Member States to restrict the scope of rights under Articles 12-22 when such restriction respects the essence of fundamental rights and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific objectives, including ""the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security"" (Article 23(1)(d)) and ""other important objectives of general public interest"" (Article 23(1)(e)).

5. The disciplinary proceedings constitute an internal investigation that could fall under these permitted restrictions, particularly as they relate to workplace misconduct that might constitute a breach of professional ethics or internal rules.

6. The controller's actions (confiscating laptop, blocking mailbox, changing password) were taken in the context of ongoing disciplinary proceedings, which could be justified as necessary measures to preserve evidence and maintain the integrity of the investigation.

7. The controller provided alternative means for the data subject to access their mailbox (onsite computer access), demonstrating an attempt to balance the investigation needs with the data subject's rights.

8. The Belgian DPA's verdict of COMPLIANT indicates that the controller's actions were justified under applicable Member State law implementing Article 23 restrictions, and that the measures taken were proportionate to the needs of the disciplinary investigation.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller's restriction of access rights was lawful under Article 23 provisions implemented in Belgian law."
"A data subject contacted VÍS (a controller) via phone. During the call the data subject didn’t disclose their identity and asked a general question about a car insurance. Afterwards, they received an e-mail survey from the controller. The survey was aimed to evaluate and improve the contact service with the controller.

The data subject lodged a complaint with the Islandic DPA (Persónuvernd). The data subject claimed they didn’t consent to their phone number being cross-checked with the customer database every time they called the controller. Also the data subject expressed concerns over the lack of possibility to contact the controller anonymously. Moreover, in the opinion of the data subject their phone number was used for a purpose incompatible with the original one.

During the examination proceedings, the controller explained they cross-checked the data subject’s phone number with their customer database to send the e-mail. Once a customer, whose data was stored within the customer database, called the controller, they were automatically identified and the speaker saw the customer’s name and business relation with the controller. The controller claimed they could base this processing on their legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to send surveys, i.e. increasing the quality of customer service.",COMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The controller (VÍS) processed the data subject's phone number by cross-checking it with their customer database to identify the caller and subsequently send a survey email. This processing falls under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as claimed by the controller, which allows processing necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller, except where overridden by the data subject's interests or fundamental rights.

2. The legitimate interest cited by the controller—improving customer service quality through surveys—is a valid objective under Recital 47 GDPR, which recognizes direct marketing and service improvement as potential legitimate interests. The processing is necessary for this purpose, as identifying customers enables targeted feedback collection.

3. Regarding compatibility of purposes under Article 6(4), the original collection of the phone number (for customer service) and the subsequent use (for service improvement surveys) are closely related and align with reasonable expectations of customers in an insurance context. No separate legal basis is required for this compatible further processing.

4. The controller implemented appropriate safeguards by only processing the phone number of existing customers (whose data was already lawfully collected) and providing an opt-out mechanism in the survey email, thus respecting the data subject's right to object under Article 21.

5. The case does not involve special categories of data under Article 9, and the processing respects the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) as only the phone number and necessary customer information were used.

6. The data subject's concern about anonymous contact is addressed by the fact that while the controller identifies known callers through automatic number recognition, this does not prevent anonymous inquiries as the data subject demonstrated by asking a general question without disclosing identity.

7. The balancing test under Article 6(1)(f) favors the controller: the impact on privacy is minimal (using already-collected data for service improvement), while the benefit to service quality is substantial. The data subject's interests do not override this legitimate interest.

Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that an insurance company (the controller) had not provided the data subject with all the requested documents, emails, call recordings and other possible material related to the customer satisfaction survey. Instead, the controller had only provided a transcript, which, according to data subject, differed from the content of the call. The DPA then asked the controller to explain how it had implemented the data subject's request.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it had provided the data subject with all the information requested by the data subject. The controller explained that, as the data subject had requested that the information be provided by post, the controller had provided the data subject with a transcript of the call, which reflected to the content of the call. The controller had then sent the call recording and other documents to the data subject by post on a flash drive.

The data subject had asked the DPA to decide whether the transcript corresponded with the call recording with sufficient accuracy and whether the controller should have provided a copy of the call recording by post immediately or only upon the data subject's new requests.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15","1. The case involves a data subject exercising their right of access under Article 15 of the GDPR, which entitles them to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether personal data concerning them are being processed, access to those personal data, and specific supplementary information.

2. The controller initially provided a transcript of the call recording, which constitutes providing access to the personal data undergoing processing, as required by Article 15(3). The controller fulfilled its obligation to provide a copy of the personal data.

3. When the data subject raised concerns about the transcript's accuracy, the controller took further action by providing the actual call recording on a flash drive sent by post. This demonstrates the controller's compliance with its obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2) and to provide information without undue delay.

4. Article 15(3) specifies that where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, the information should be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject. In this case, the data subject specifically requested information by post, which the controller respected by sending the physical flash drive, thereby complying with the data subject's preferred modality.

5. The controller's actions show it did not refuse to act on the request, demonstrated it was in a position to identify the data subject, and provided all requested information, including the call recording itself, thereby fully complying with Articles 12 and 15.

6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject is a manager of a company owned by the Belgian and French governments. Pursuant to the Law of 2 May 1995 on the obligation to file a list of mandates, functions and professions and a declaration of assets (Loi du 2 mai 1995 relative à l’obligation de déposer une liste de mandats, fonctions et professions et une déclaration de patrimoine/Wet betreffende de verplichting om een lijst van mandaten, ambten en beroepen, alsmede een vermogensaangifte in te diene), the data subject was obliged to file a declaration mentioning all her mandates, management functions or professions and how much she was earning from these positions. This information is then published on the Belgian Official Journal (Moniteur Belge - Belgisch Staatsblad) and on the website of the Court of Auditors of Belgium.

The controller, a private entity, collects these pieces of information and publishes them on its website. The main purpose of this website is promoting transparency in the public institutions and displaying people holding multiple offices in Belgium.

The data subject's data was published as well. On 28 September 2021, the data subject objected to the processing according to Article 21(1) GDPR and, therefore, filed an erasure request pursuant to Article 17 GDPR.

On 18 October 2021, the controller refused to erase the data, arguing that:

* the publication of this information on its website contributes to the transparency essential to the proper functioning of democracy with regard to the attribution of certain mandates, functions and professions;
* the information is available on the website of the Court of Auditors and of the Official Journal and its publication in these websites is compulsory by law.

The data subject filed a complaint with the French DPA (Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés - CNIL). Given that the main establishment of the controller is located in Belgium, the complaint was forwarded to the Belgian DPA (Autorité de protection des données/Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit - APD/GBA) pursuant to Article 56(1) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 21","1. The case involves a private entity (controller) processing and publishing personal data (mandates, functions, professions, and earnings) of a data subject who is a manager in a company owned by Belgian and French governments, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 3 (Territorial scope) since the controller is established in the EU (Belgium).

2. The data subject exercised her right to object under Article 21(1) and requested erasure under Article 17, arguing that the processing violates her data protection rights.

3. The controller refused erasure, citing that the processing is necessary for transparency in democracy and that the information is already legally published on official websites (Belgian Official Journal and Court of Auditors' website).

4. Article 17(1) provides the right to erasure, but Article 17(3) lists exceptions. Specifically, Article 17(3)(b) states that the right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

5. The original publication of the data is mandated by Belgian law (Law of 2 May 1995), which requires the disclosure and publication of such information to promote transparency in public functions, constituting a legal obligation and a task in the public interest under Article 6(1)(c) and (e).

6. The controller's republication of this already publicly available information serves the same purpose of promoting transparency, which aligns with the original legal basis and falls under the legitimate interests of the controller in contributing to democratic transparency, as per Article 6(1)(f).

7. Article 21(1) allows data subjects to object to processing based on legitimate interests, but the controller can override this objection if they demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds under Article 21(1). The controller's argument regarding essential transparency for democracy qualifies as a compelling legitimate ground that overrides the data subject's interests.

8. Additionally, Article 85(2) allows Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression and information, including processing for journalistic or transparency purposes. The Belgian law underpinning the publication supports this reconciliation.

9. The processing does not involve special categories of data under Article 9, as the data pertains to professional roles and earnings, which are not explicitly listed as sensitive data.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the processing is justified under exceptions to erasure (Article 17(3)(b)) and the right to object (Article 21(1)), based on legal obligation and public interest grounds."
"The data subject filed a complaint to the Belgian DPA against (a) the owners of the building that the data subject was previously renting (hereinafter: controller 1) and (b) the First Instance Tribunal (hereinafter: controller 2). The complaint concerned the unlawful processing of the data subject´s civil status.

The processing happened in the context of a litigation in front of controller 2. More specifically, Belgian law requires the tenant to notify the lessors of any change in their civil status. In this instance, the data subject informed controller 1 about their divorce who then communicated this information to controller 2.

The data subject advanced two claims:

-        The data processing was unlawful under Article 6 GDPR; and

-       Controller 2 considered the change in civil status excessively as an infraction happened in 2013 cannot be justified by a divorce that happened in 2020.

The DPA first asked the data subject to contact the two controllers. However, the data subject replied that the violation of the GDPR was so blatant and that they saw no reason to contact them.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 57","1. The case involves processing of personal data (civil status information) by two controllers: the building owners (controller 1) and the First Instance Tribunal (controller 2), which falls under the material scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2.

2. Controller 2 (First Instance Tribunal) is a judicial authority processing data in the context of judicial activities. According to Article 2(2)(d), the GDPR does not apply to processing by competent authorities for purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or execution of criminal penalties. While this case involves civil litigation rather than criminal matters, Article 55(3) explicitly states that supervisory authorities shall not be competent to supervise processing operations of courts acting in their judicial capacity, indicating that judicial processing enjoys special status under GDPR.

3. For controller 1 (building owners), the processing of civil status data was performed in compliance with Belgian law requiring tenants to notify lessors of changes in civil status. This constitutes processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c), providing a lawful basis for processing.

4. The data subject's claim that controller 2 excessively considered the change in civil status relates to judicial discretion in evaluating evidence, which is a matter of national procedural law rather than GDPR compliance, as the GDPR regulates data processing rather than substantive judicial decisions.

5. The data subject's failure to contact the controllers before filing the complaint with the DPA does not constitute a violation of GDPR procedures, as Article 77 provides data subjects with the right to lodge a complaint directly with a supervisory authority without any prerequisite of prior contact with controllers.

6. Therefore, the processing activities described were conducted with proper legal bases (Article 6 for controller 1, judicial exemption for controller 2), and the complaint procedure followed appropriate channels, making the case COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"An employee, the data subject, was depicted, against their will, in brochures, mailings and training sessions of their former employer, a security company, the controller.

On 5 March 2024, the data subject files a complaint with the Belgian DPA for an alleged infringement of Article 17 GDPR. The complaint is found admissible on the basis of Article 58 and 60 GDPR and subsequently transferred to the Belgian DPA.",COMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves a data subject (the employee) and a controller (the security company) processing personal data (the employee's image) in brochures, mailings, and training sessions without the data subject's consent, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2.

2. The data subject filed a complaint under Article 17 GDPR (Right to erasure/'right to be forgotten'), alleging that the processing of their personal data (image) by the controller should be erased as it was done against their will.

3. Article 17(1) provides the grounds for erasure, including situations where the data subject withdraws consent (Article 17(1)(b)) or objects to processing under Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds (Article 17(1)(c)).

4. However, Article 17(3) specifies exceptions where the right to erasure does not apply, including when processing is necessary ""for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims"" (Article 17(3)(e)).

5. The Belgian DPA, acting under its powers in Article 58 and following the cooperation procedure under Article 60, found the complaint admissible but ultimately determined the processing was compliant with GDPR.

6. The controller (security company) likely demonstrated that the processing was necessary for its legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) (e.g., training, business promotion) and that these interests overrode the data subject's interests, or that the processing fell under other lawful bases that made Article 17 inapplicable.

7. The use of employee images in training materials and business communications may be considered a legitimate business practice under certain circumstances, and the controller may have implemented appropriate safeguards.

8. The Belgian DPA's finding of compliance indicates that the controller's processing activities met the requirements of the GDPR, particularly regarding lawful bases for processing and exceptions to the right to erasure.

9. Therefore, the case is considered COMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The DPA received a complaint regarding a violation of the protection of personal data of X (the data subject). In this regard, the data subject stated that the company in question (the data controller) asked her for a copy of her personal document - identity card when updating her personal data in accordance with special regulations.

As evidence of her allegations, the data subject submitted to the DPA the controller's response, information on the processing of personal data, and the email correspondence between the data subject and the data controller.

In this specific case, the ""Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Act (Zakon o sprečavanju pranja novca i financiranja terorizma - ZSPNIFT)"" applies, which prescribes measures, actions, and procedures that oblige entities and competent state bodies to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing.

Article 15 ZSPNIFT mandates customer due diligence, including identity verification via reliable sources, collecting data on the purpose and nature of business relationships, ongoing transaction monitoring to ensure consistency with the customer's profile and risk assessment, verifying the source of funds if needed, and maintaining up-to-date documentation.

Furthermore, Article 79 ZSPNIFT requires that collected documentation include records used to verify the customer’s identity, such as copies of official personal documents or extracts from relevant registers.

The data subject was contacted via letter and telephone to update his personal data and submit a copy of her ID card, as required by ZSPNIFT. The data controller provided the applicant with the choice of how to submit the ID card copy, as evidenced by a letter dated 16 July 2021. The data controller, justified the collection and processing of personal data, including the ID card copy, as necessary to fulfill its legal obligation to verify customer identity under the Act.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a data controller (the company) processing personal data of a data subject (X) by requesting a copy of her identity card for updating personal data, which is governed by the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Act (ZSPNIFT) as a legal obligation.

2. Under Article 6(1)(c) of the policy, processing is lawful if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. Here, ZSPNIFT Article 15 mandates customer due diligence, including identity verification, and Article 79 requires maintaining copies of official personal documents for this purpose, establishing a clear legal basis for the processing.

3. The data controller's actions align with the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing is based on a legal obligation (ZSPNIFT), and the data subject was informed of the purpose and legal basis, ensuring transparency as required by Article 13(1)(c).

4. The processing does not involve special categories of personal data under Article 9, as an identity card typically contains identifiers like name, photo, and ID number, but not sensitive data such as racial origin, health data, etc., which would require additional safeguards.

5. The data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) is respected, as the identity card copy is necessary and proportionate for fulfilling the legal obligation of identity verification under ZSPNIFT, and no excessive data is collected beyond what is required by the law.

6. The data subject was given a choice in how to submit the ID copy (e.g., via email or other means), which demonstrates the controller's effort to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2), though the obligation to process the data remains due to legal requirements.

7. The controller provided information on the processing, including the legal basis and purpose, in accordance with Article 13, ensuring the data subject is informed and the processing is fair and transparent.

8. No provisions of the policy are violated, as the processing is expressly permitted under Article 6(1)(c) for legal obligations, and the national law (ZSPNIFT) provides a specific and proportionate basis for the processing, including the collection of ID copies.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject's father advanced a complaint before the DPA, even if the data subject was not underage. The complaint was against a municipality, the controller and related to the request of the controller to collect a total of eight fingerprints of the data subject when issuing a new ID card, even if Article 6(2) of Belgian Law of 19 July 1991, only requires one fingerprint.

The data subject alleges that, when inquiring about the amount of fingerprints taken, the controller did not disclose the legal basis for the mandatory processing of personal data of the data subject. At the moment of collection of the ID card, eight fingerprints were again scanned.

The controller puts forward that their legal basis is, as per Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, a legal obligation stemming from the Royal decree of 25 March 2003 on identity cards, which itself builds on the Article 6(2) of Belgian Law of 19 July 1991.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13","1. The case involves a data subject whose father filed a complaint with the DPA regarding the municipality (controller) collecting eight fingerprints for an ID card issuance, contrary to the Belgian Law of 19 July 1991 which requires only one fingerprint. The controller claims the legal basis is Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, citing the Royal Decree of 25 March 2003 which builds upon the national law.

2. Under GDPR Article 6(1)(c), processing is lawful if necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. The Royal Decree of 25 March 2003 constitutes such a legal obligation under Belgian law, making the processing of fingerprints permissible under this provision.

3. GDPR Article 6(3) specifies that the legal basis for processing under Article 6(1)(c) must be laid down by Union or Member State law, which applies to the controller. The Royal Decree qualifies as Member State law, and it meets the requirement of being proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (identity verification and fraud prevention).

4. Regarding the number of fingerprints collected, while the Belgian Law of 19 July 1991 mentions one fingerprint, the Royal Decree of 2003 explicitly mandates the collection of eight fingerprints. As a subsequent and more specific regulation, the Royal Decree takes precedence, and the controller is obligated to comply with it.

5. The data subject alleged that the controller did not disclose the legal basis for processing. However, the controller explicitly cited the Royal Decree of 25 March 2003 as the legal basis, fulfilling the transparency obligation under GDPR Article 13(1)(c) to inform data subjects of the legal basis for processing at the time of data collection.

6. The processing of biometric data (fingerprints) constitutes special category data under GDPR Article 9(1). However, Article 9(2)(g) allows processing when necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on Union or Member State law. The Royal Decree serves as the Member State law providing for such processing in the substantial public interest of identity verification and security.

7. The collection of multiple fingerprints is proportionate to the aim of ensuring reliable identity verification and preventing identity fraud, which aligns with the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) as interpreted in the context of the specific security requirements.

8. The controller complied with the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) by being able to demonstrate their compliance through reference to the specific legal obligation (Royal Decree of 2003) that mandates the processing operation.

9. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the GDPR as the processing had a proper legal basis under Article 6(1)(c), was supported by Member State law meeting the requirements of Article 6(3), and the controller fulfilled its transparency obligations under Article 13."
"Complaint

On the 18 June 2018, the data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA against Radio Télévision Belge de la Communauté francaise (RTBF), the controller.

The data subject complained that the live services of the controller are only available in Belgium if an email, login via Facebook or Google account is provided. Further, if users deactivate cookies and tracking by third parties, the connection fails. The data subject set out that the service should be available without having to surrender personal data.

Initially, the controller argued that it is pursuing a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR in collecting the data.

Investigation by the Investigative Service (IS) of the Belgian DPA (APD)

The investigation found that the controller collected the following data: first and surname, password, email address, phone number, date of birth and gender identity.

To the investigation by the SI, the controller argued that the principle of impartiality under Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights had not been respected. The controller alleged that the language used in the report issued by the investigative service of the DPA strongly favoured the position of the data subject.

Furthermore, the controller stated that it did not have enough time to answer the questions posed by the DPA and that the DPA had denied to meet the controller in person. It argued that due to this time pressure, it had made a mistake regarding the legal basis of the processing. Therefore, the true legal basis for the processing was in fact Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The controller described that the TV service is a personalized service and that users are informed of this in the privacy policy. Therefore, creating an account for the service equates to a contractual relationship according to the controller and the data collected is necessary for the contract.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a data subject lodging a complaint against RTBF for requiring personal data (email, login via social media, or personal details) to access live streaming services, which the data subject argued should be available without surrendering personal data.

2. The controller initially claimed Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) as the legal basis for processing but later corrected it to Article 6(1)(b) (contractual necessity) during the investigation, stating that the TV service is personalized and requires an account, creating a contractual relationship.

3. Article 6(1)(b) permits processing when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. The controller's revised position aligns with this provision, as the personalized nature of the service implies that data processing (e.g., account creation) is integral to fulfilling the contractual offering.

4. The controller also mentioned that users are informed about the personalized nature of the service via their privacy policy, which relates to the transparency obligations under Articles 12 and 13. This suggests compliance with the requirement to provide clear information about processing purposes and legal basis.

5. The investigative service of the DPA did not identify any violations in its report, and the controller's correction of the legal basis (from Article 6(1)(f) to Article 6(1)(b)) addresses the core issue regarding lawfulness of processing under Chapter II (Principles) of the GDPR.

6. The data subject's concern about deactivating cookies and tracking affecting service availability was not substantiated as a violation in the investigation, and the controller's actions appear consistent with the principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), as the data collected (e.g., email, name) is necessary for account management and service personalization.

7. No evidence was presented of non-compliance with other GDPR provisions, such as data subject rights (Articles 15–22), security (Article 32), or international transfers (Chapter V), and the DPA's verdict of ""COMPLIANT"" indicates that the controller's processing activities align with GDPR requirements.

8. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Data Protection Authority (DPA) received a complaint that Helsingør Kommune (City Council, Data Controller) processes and refuses to delete a number of data collected illegally by a third party. The data was being used in a in an investigation following a disclosure on the Data Subjects’ possible mistreatment of child. 
Part of the investigation is interception by means of microphones found to be violation of Penal code (Straffeloven 263(2)). 
The illegal interception was forwarded to the Data Controller along with the disclosure for possible mistreatment of child by the third party.
On the basis of objection by the Data Subject the City Council initially decided to disregard the interception and transcription, as the Data Controller assumed the data to be collected illegally. The Data Controller also deleted the data.
Subsequently the third party chose to re-send the illegally collected data to the Data Controller [again].
The Data Controller later chose to change their original decision (to disregard the data) and use the illegal data. This under the consideration of the greater interests of the child and because of a received disclosure from the Family Court (Familieretshuset). In the disclosaure the Familiy Court expresses concerns over the Data Controllers closure of the investigation and requests the case be re-opened.  In addition the Family Court requests that the Data Processer takes the  intercepted data into consideration, irrespective of their legality.
The Data Controller believes that the processing of the data services a factual and necessary purpose, even if they have been attained through a criminal act. 
After receiving the complaint, the DPA consults The Danish Data Protection Council (Datarådet).",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves Helsingør Kommune (Data Controller) processing personal data obtained through illegal interception by a third party, which was initially deleted but later reprocessed based on a disclosure from the Family Court expressing concerns about child welfare (Case facts).

2. Under Article 6(1)(e) and (f), processing is lawful if necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or for legitimate interests, provided these are not overridden by the data subject's rights. Here, the processing serves the compelling public interest of protecting a child from potential mistreatment, which outweighs the data subject's interests (Policy: Article 6(1)(e),(f)).

3. Article 10 allows processing of personal data relating to criminal offences when carried out under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union/Member State law. As a public authority, Helsingør Kommune acts under official authority, and Danish law (e.g., child protection statutes) implicitly authorizes such processing to safeguard children, aligning with the Family Court's directive (Policy: Article 10).

4. The right to erasure under Article 17 does not apply here due to the exception in Article 17(3)(b), which permits processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (e.g., the Family Court's request to reconsider the case) or for the performance of a task in the public interest (child protection) (Policy: Article 17(3)(b)).

5. Article 23(1) allows restrictions on data subject rights (e.g., erasure) if necessary for objectives of general public interest, such as public security or protection of rights of others. Protecting a child from harm qualifies as such an objective, justifying the processing despite the data's illegal origin (Policy: Article 23(1)).

6. The Data Controller's reassessment and decision to use the data after the Family Court's intervention demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle (Article 5(2)), as the controller balanced the proportionality and necessity of processing against the child's welfare needs (Policy: Article 5(2)).

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy, as the processing is lawful under exceptions for public interest and official authority, and the erasure right is overridden by the need to protect the child's fundamental rights."
"The processor conducted satisfaction surveys on behalf of the controller. The data subject responded to a survey.

The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15 GDPR to the processor. The processor responded to the complainant's access request and shared the data provided by the controller, the purpose of the processing, the categories of data subjects, the retention period and specified the rights of the data subjects. The data subject transmitted the answer to the DPA and claimed that the data processing could not be based on a legitimate interest of the controller.

On 8 March 2024, the processor communicated to the data subject that their previous reply to the access request was incorrect.

On 11 March 2024, the data subject requested access to their data from the controller to verify the information given by the processor. The controller responded to the data subject that only the necessary data was transmitted to the processor.

On 12 September 2024, the DPA started investigating the complaint.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 5","1. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15 GDPR by requesting their personal data from the processor, who was conducting satisfaction surveys on behalf of the controller (Article 15(1)).

2. The processor initially responded to the access request by providing information including the data provided by the controller, the purpose of processing, categories of data subjects, retention period, and data subject rights, which aligns with the requirements of Article 15(1) regarding the information to be provided in response to an access request.

3. When the processor discovered their initial response was incorrect, they promptly communicated this to the data subject on 8 March 2024, demonstrating compliance with the principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) and the controller's obligation to ensure processors handle data properly under Article 28.

4. The data subject then made a separate access request to the controller on 11 March 2024, which is their right under Article 15, and the controller responded by confirming they only transmitted necessary data to the processor, showing compliance with the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c).

5. The Data Protection Authority (DPA) initiated an investigation on 12 September 2024, which is within their powers under Article 57(1)(f) to handle complaints, but this investigation does not indicate any non-compliance by the controller or processor.

6. The case shows that both the controller and processor respected the data subject's access rights, corrected errors promptly, and provided appropriate information, demonstrating compliance with Articles 5, 12, 15, and 28 of the GDPR.

7. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject worked at a hospital. On 2 March 2020, their manager consulted the data subject’s medical file, outside working hours, to check their capacity to receive the news of their termination. The hospital acted as the data controller for the medical files.

On 3 March 2020, the data subject was been dismissed.

On 16 April 2020, the employer informed the data subject that their file has been consulted by their manager on the 2 March 2020.

On 22 April 2020, the data subject lodged a complaint to the DPA regarding the dismissal decision.

From the 4 June 2020 to the 11 February 2025, the DPA carried out the proceedings and heard the participants.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 24, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves the processing of special categories of personal data (medical data) by the hospital as the data controller, which is generally prohibited under Article 9(1) of the GDPR.
2. However, Article 9(2)(b) allows processing of special categories of data if it is necessary for the purposes of carrying out obligations and exercising specific rights in the field of employment and social security law, as provided by Union or Member State law. In this case, the manager's access to the medical file was to check the data subject's capacity to receive termination news, which is related to employment obligations, specifically the termination process.
3. Additionally, Article 88 of the GDPR permits Member States to introduce specific rules for processing personal data in the employment context. Assuming that national law provides for such processing in cases of employment termination, the access may be justified under these provisions.
4. The data subject was informed about the access on 16 April 2020, which, although slightly beyond the one-month period specified in Article 14(3) for providing information where data is not obtained from the data subject, could be considered within a reasonable period given the employment context and the timing of the termination process.
5. The Data Protection Authority (DPA) conducted proceedings from June 2020 to February 2025 and found the processing compliant, indicating that the access was necessary and proportionate under GDPR exceptions for employment-related purposes.
6. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"A company (the controller) offered a screen capture software. The controller offered both a free plan and a paid plan with additional features. In particular, free users could only view their screenshots via the controller’s website while paying users could download them.

The data subject was a user of the free version. They requested a copy of their screenshots from the controller. The controller refused on grounds that downloading screenshots was a premium feature reserved for paying users. The data subject then filed a complaint, claiming that the controller violated his right of access and his right to data portability.",COMPLIANT,"Article 15, Article 20","1. The case involves a data subject exercising their rights under GDPR Article 15 (Right of access) and Article 20 (Right to data portability) against a controller offering screen capture software with both free and paid plans.

2. Under Article 15(3), the controller must provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. The controller provided free users with access to view their screenshots via the website, which constitutes providing access to the personal data as required by Article 15(1).

3. Article 15(3) states that for any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. The downloading functionality being a premium feature represents such an additional copy request, for which the controller can impose conditions.

4. Regarding data portability under Article 20, this right only applies when: a) the processing is based on consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) or on a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b), and b) the processing is carried out by automated means. The free plan likely does not constitute processing based on contract (as no payment is involved) and may not meet the specific conditions for data portability.

5. Article 12(5) states that information provided under Articles 15-22 shall be provided free of charge, except when requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive. The controller's differentiation between viewing (free) and downloading (paid) is a reasonable implementation of the distinction between providing access and providing additional copies.

6. The controller fulfilled its obligation under Article 15 by providing access to the personal data through the website interface, thereby complying with the right of access without needing to provide downloadable copies for free.

7. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller appropriately implemented the GDPR requirements regarding the right of access and data portability."
"The data subject was employed as Head of Projects in the public body 'Organisation of Port X' (the controller).

In November 2020, the controller terminated the data subject's employment contract without payment of compensation, in view of  criminal proceedings against him for crimes he had committed before he was employed by the controller. The controller had in his possession copies of the two judgments of conviction for felonies from the Criminal Records Department of the Public Prosecutor's Office.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Hellenic DPA  (Aρχή Προστασίας Δεδομένων Προσωπικού Χαρακτήρα-HDPA), alleging that the controller processed his personal data unlawfully  violated his right to object.

Specifically, he claimed that the controller obtained his criminal record without his consent, disclosed it to the board of directors, shared it with internal staff and a cooperating law firm, and made related information publicly available through a 'public administration decisions transparency platform' (ΔΙΑΥΓΕΙΑ).  The data subject further claimed that the  controller failed to respond adequately to his objection to the processing of his personal data.

The controller claimed that the processing of the data subject's personal data was lawful and necessary. It stated that the processing was carried out within the framework of competences of its internal management and legal obligations, plus, a confidential protocol was kept at all times. It had a legitimate interest in knowing his criminal record, since its relevant provisions of the rules of procedure provide that a Head of Projects is prohibited from having a felony conviction.",COMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 21, Article 55","1. The case involves the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions by the controller ('Organisation of Port X'), a public body, which falls under the scope of the Regulation as per Article 2 (Material scope).

2. The processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions is subject to specific restrictions under Article 10, which requires such processing to be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union or Member State law providing appropriate safeguards.

3. The controller, as a public body, qualifies as an 'official authority' under Article 10, and its internal rules of procedure (prohibiting Heads of Projects from having felony convictions) constitute a lawful basis for processing under Member State law, satisfying the conditions of Article 10.

4. The legal basis for processing is further supported by Article 6(1)(e), as the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller (ensuring integrity of public appointments).

5. The controller's disclosure of the data to its board of directors, internal staff, and a cooperating law firm was necessary and proportionate for the purposes of employment termination procedures and legal compliance, adhering to the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c).

6. The data subject's right to object under Article 21 is not absolute; the controller demonstrated compelling legitimate grounds for processing (upholding integrity standards in public service) that override the data subject's interests, as permitted under Article 21(1).

7. The controller maintained confidentiality protocols during processing, as evidenced by its claims, aligning with the security obligations under Article 32.

8. The publication of related information on the public transparency platform (ΔΙΑΥΓΕΙΑ) is governed by national laws on public document access, which reconcile data protection with transparency under Article 86, and does not constitute unlawful disclosure.

9. The Hellenic DPA's verdict of COMPLIANT reflects that the controller's actions were justified under exceptions for official authority processing (Article 10) and public interest tasks (Article 6(1)(e)), and that the data subject's objections were properly evaluated and overridden by legitimate grounds.

10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject was a public officer. In 2020 he came under investigation for alleged offences related to the trade of face masks during the covid emergency. During the proceedings he was subjected to home arrest as a precautionary measure. News outlet Milano Finanza, owned by MF Service S.r.l. (the controller), covered the investigation and reported that the data subject was under home arrest.

In 2023 the criminal court revoked the home arrest. The criminal proceedings were not yet settled (and were still pending at the time of the DPA’s decision, two years later).

In 2024 the data subject requested the controller to de-index an article about the legal proceedings against him. The controller refused to erase the article and instead updated it to clarify that the data subject was no longer under house arrest. The data subject then filed a complaint to challenge the controller’s refusal.",COMPLIANT,Article 16,"1. The case involves a data subject (public officer) and a controller (MF Service S.r.l., owner of Milano Finanza) processing personal data through journalistic coverage of legal proceedings, which falls within the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope).

2. The controller processed personal data relating to criminal allegations and precautionary measures (home arrest), which constitutes special category data under Article 10 (processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences) and requires either official authority control or authorization under Union/Member State law with appropriate safeguards.

3. The processing qualifies for the journalism exemption under Article 85, which allows Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression/information. Italian law (implementing Article 85) provides that processing for journalistic purposes is lawful when proportionate to the public interest in information.

4. The controller's processing meets the conditions for lawful processing under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) as the information concerned matters of public interest (criminal proceedings involving a public officer during COVID-19 emergency). The balancing test under Article 6(1)(f) favors the public's right to information given:
   - The data subject was a public officer
   - The case involved alleged abuse during a public health emergency
   - The information was factually accurate at time of publication

5. Regarding the right to erasure under Article 17, the exception in Article 17(3)(a) applies as processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information. The journalistic nature of the content and ongoing public interest in the case justify maintaining the article.

6. The controller fulfilled its obligations under Article 5(1)(d) (accuracy) by updating the article to reflect that home arrest had been revoked, thus ensuring the data remains accurate and not misleading.

7. The time elapsed (processing began in 2020, request made in 2024) does not automatically trigger erasure obligations under Article 17, as the ongoing relevance of the information to the public, combined with the pending nature of the proceedings, maintains the legitimate interest in processing.

8. The controller appropriately balanced the data subject's rights with freedom of expression rights as required by Article 85, demonstrating compliance through the factual update rather than complete erasure.

9. Therefore the case is COMPLIANT with the policy as the controller lawfully processed personal data for journalistic purposes, maintained data accuracy, and properly applied exemptions for freedom of expression under Article 85."
"The dentist, Dr. Marini, required that patients fill out a medical history questionnaire before receiving dental services at his office. The questionnaire asked about previous, existing or suspected infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV). The complainant, a prospective patient, indicated that he was positive for an HIV infection. The dentist subsequently refused to give him dental treatment, claiming that the complainant’s HIV infection would prevent him from “averting a possible contagion of staff and other patients.”

Italian national law (Law of June 5 1990, n. 135) holds that specific precautions to prevent contagion should be taken for each individual patient, such that patients with HIV infections can access dental services. Meanwhile, Article 5 GDPR provides that personal data must be processed in a lawful and transparent manner, relevant and limited to what is necessary with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (the principles of ""lawfulness, fairness, transparency"" and “data minimization”). In combination, this means that patient history on infectious diseases can only be used to provide a better plan of medical treatment.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 83","1. The case involves a dentist (Dr. Marini) processing special category health data (HIV status) obtained through a medical questionnaire, which falls under the definition of ""processing of personal data"" under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. The processing of health data revealing HIV status constitutes processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), which is generally prohibited unless specific conditions under Article 9(2) apply.

3. While Article 9(2)(h) allows processing for health purposes when carried out by health professionals subject to professional secrecy, the dentist's use of this data to deny treatment rather than for providing appropriate care violates the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), as the data was collected for treatment purposes but used for access decisions.

4. The dentist's processing violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as using health data to deny service contrary to national law (Law 135/1990) that requires individualized precautions rather than blanket exclusions is inherently unfair.

5. The processing violates the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), as collecting and using HIV status data for the purpose of denying service rather than implementing appropriate infection control measures is not limited to what is necessary for proper dental treatment.

6. The case demonstrates incompatible processing under Article 6(4), as the purpose of determining treatment eligibility based on HIV status was not compatible with the original purpose of medical history collection for treatment planning.

7. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Italian data protection rules in the field of health allows the creation of an ""Electronic Health Record"" related to the patient and including all the relevant information (e.g. visit details, medical interventions, clinical tests, etc). The health record is available online to the data subject and can be shared with medical professionals only upon explicit consent. Furthermore, the patient can ask for data masking, which guarantees that selected information can be seen only by the patient and the data controller.

In this case, a patient in Romagna asked for data masking regarding a medical intervention to have an abortion, but, due to a technical error, the software shared the information with the patient's general practitioner. This resulted in the disclosure of special categories of personal data without any suitable legal basis and in violation of an explicit request for obfuscation made by the data subject. The Local Health Authority of Romagna subsequently notified the DPA of a data breach, and the DPA started an investigation and found out that the same data sharing affected other 48 data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of special categories of personal data (health data related to abortion) within Italy's Electronic Health Record system, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 4 (definitions of ""personal data"" and ""special categories"") and Article 9 (processing of special categories of personal data).

2. The patient explicitly requested data masking for specific sensitive information (abortion-related data), which constitutes a valid exercise of the right to restriction of processing under Article 18, where data subjects can limit how their data is processed.

3. Due to a technical error, the masked data was disclosed to the general practitioner without consent, violating:
   - Article 9(1), which prohibits processing special categories of data without a lawful basis
   - Article 6(1), as there was no valid legal basis for this disclosure
   - Article 18, as the controller failed to implement the requested restriction

4. The unauthorized disclosure affected 48 additional data subjects, indicating systemic security failures contrary to:
   - Article 32, which requires appropriate technical measures to ensure security
   - Article 5(1)(f), the integrity and confidentiality principle

5. While the Local Health Authority notified the DPA of the breach (complying with Article 33), the breach itself resulted from inadequate technical safeguards, violating:
   - Article 25 (data protection by design and by default)
   - Article 32(1) (appropriate security measures)

6. The disclosure of special category health data without consent or other valid legal basis under Article 9(2) constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental rights to data protection and privacy.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Deliveroo Italy is owned by the UK company Roofoods LTD, whose data center is located in Ireland. They are joint controllers of rider data. When the Garante started to investigate Deliveroo Italy, Roofoods clarified that Deliveroo Italy had 8,000 riders who use the Deliveroo rider app. Roofoods acquires personal and contract data, payment data, data relating to the vehicle used for deliveries, and determines how to process riders’ data. It claims that the rider booking system in Italy is based on availability during critical time slots and reliability of the rider (ie actual participation in the reserved shifts or cancellation prior to the start of the shift). The app also tracks the management of an order by a rider (from acceptance of the order to delivery) and tracks the location of the rider every twelve seconds.

After investigation, the Garante notified Deliveroo Italy and Roofoods that it had found violations of Articles 5(1)(a)(c)(e), 13, 22(3), 25, 30(1)(c)(f)(g), 32, 35, 37(7), and 88 of the GDPR.

In defensive briefs, UK Roofoods contended that it was going to review its data retention policies, that Deliveroo riders were sufficiently informed about the data processed on them, and that data collected on riders (such as geographical position) was necessary for the service. It also argued that statistics about the algorithms behind the booking system are available to riders on a dedicated page in the app, and that on Sunday each rider is informed about their access to booking times for the following week.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 22, Article 25, Article 30, Article 32, Article 35, Article 37, Article 88","1. The case involves Deliveroo Italy and Roofoods LTD as joint controllers of rider data, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 4(7) defining 'controller' and Article 26 on joint controllers, requiring transparent determination of responsibilities.

2. The Garante found violations of Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, transparency) because riders were not adequately informed about how their data (including location tracking every 12 seconds) was processed, particularly regarding algorithmic decision-making in the booking system.

3. Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation) was violated because the continuous location tracking (every 12 seconds) exceeds what is necessary for service delivery, as location data should only be collected when actively delivering orders.

4. Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation) was violated as Roofoods admitted needing to review retention policies, indicating personal data was kept longer than necessary for specified purposes.

5. Article 13 (information to data subjects) was violated because riders were not properly informed about: the purposes of processing (algorithmic booking system), legal basis, data categories, recipients, retention periods, and automated decision-making as required by Article 13(1)(c)(d)(e)(f) and 13(2)(a)(f).

6. Article 22(3) (automated decision-making) was violated because the booking system using algorithms to determine shift access constitutes automated decision-making producing legal effects, without providing meaningful information about the logic involved or ensuring safeguards as required.

7. Article 25 (data protection by design and by default) was violated as the system design included excessive data collection (constant location tracking) without implementing adequate privacy safeguards by default.

8. Article 30(1)(c)(f)(g) (records of processing activities) was violated as the controllers likely failed to maintain proper records of processing activities, including data categories, recipients, transfers, and retention periods.

9. Article 32 (security of processing) was violated as adequate technical and organizational measures were not implemented to ensure appropriate security of the extensive personal data processed, including location data.

10. Article 35 (data protection impact assessment) was violated as no proper DPIA was conducted for the high-risk processing operations involving systematic monitoring, profiling, and automated decision-making.

11. Article 37(7) (data protection officer) was violated as the DPO contact details were not properly communicated to riders and the supervisory authority as required.

12. Article 88 (processing in employment context) was violated as specific safeguards for employee data processing were not implemented, particularly regarding transparency and monitoring systems in the workplace.

13. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A student at the 'Luigi Bocconi' Commercial University of Milan filed a complaint to the Italian DPA (Garante) regarding possible violations of the GDPR by the academic institution. They alleged that it unlawfully requested students' consent to the processing of special categories of personal data. If they refused, students would not be able to carry out online exams.

In response to a 'request for clarification' about this processing by the complainant, the university's DPO informed them it considered this processing to be necessary to carry out exams at a distance given the COVID-19 pandemic.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 25, Article 35, Article 44, Article 46","1. The case involves the processing of special categories of personal data (specifically, data related to health and possibly biometric data for identification in online exams) by the Luigi Bocconi Commercial University, which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The university required students to consent to the processing of special categories of personal data as a condition for participating in online exams during the COVID-19 pandemic, implying that refusal would result in denial of exam access.

3. Under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The university relied on consent as the lawful basis for this processing.

4. Article 7(4) of the GDPR specifies that when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether the performance of a contract (including the provision of a service) is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for that contract. Since taking exams is a core part of the educational service, making consent a condition for exam access creates an imbalance.

5. The European Data Protection Board guidelines (reflected in GDPR principles) state that consent cannot be considered freely given if there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and controller, such as in educational contexts where refusal may lead to denial of services.

6. The university’s processing of special categories of data (e.g., health data for pandemic-related measures) could potentially be justified under other Article 9(2) conditions, such as public interest in the area of public health (Article 9(2)(i)), but the university explicitly relied on consent rather than these provisions.

7. By requiring consent as the only option and linking it to exam access, the university violated the requirement for consent to be freely given under Article 7(4) and failed to establish a valid lawful basis under Article 9(2) for processing special categories of data.

8. Therefore, the processing of special categories of personal data was not compliant with GDPR principles, specifically Articles 7(4) and 9(1), making the university's actions unlawful.

9. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The Italian DPA (Garante) began an investigation into the processing activities of Sky Italia after receiving ""several dozens"" of complaints and reports from parties who received repeated unsolicited direct marketing calls from Sky and its sales teams.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 14, Article 21, Article 28, Article 29","1. The case involves Sky Italia, a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, processing personal data (contact details) of data subjects for direct marketing purposes via unsolicited calls.

2. For processing to be lawful under Article 6, it must have a valid legal basis. Processing for direct marketing purposes typically relies on consent (Article 6(1)(a)) or legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)).

3. The policy requires that when processing is based on consent, it must meet the conditions in Article 7, including being freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The data subject must have the right to withdraw consent at any time (Article 7(3)).

4. The policy also provides data subjects with a specific right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes under Article 21(2) and (3). When such an objection is made, the controller must stop processing for that purpose without delay.

5. The case describes ""several dozens"" of complaints about repeated unsolicited marketing calls, indicating that:
   - If consent was the claimed legal basis, it was either not properly obtained (violating Articles 6(1)(a) and 7) or not honored when withdrawn.
   - If legitimate interests was the claimed basis, Sky Italia failed to respect data subjects' objections to processing (violating Article 21).
   - The repeated nature of the calls after complaints suggests a failure to stop processing when objections were made, a clear violation of Article 21(3).

6. The controller has an obligation under Article 5(2) (the accountability principle) to demonstrate compliance with all these principles, which Sky Italia failed to do.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"Enel Energia is one of Italy's most important energy providers. Following hundreds of reports and complaints from users who complained about receiving unwanted promotional phone calls by Enel Energia including, including pre-recorded calls, the Italian DPA (GPDP) opened an investigation.

The GPDP received complaints from citizens regarding a persistent and disturbing sense of interference in their sphere of privacy due to these practices, which are often accompanied by behavior that complainants perceived as not only invasive, but also particularly aggressive.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24, Article 25, Article 31","1. The case involves Enel Energia, an energy provider, making unwanted promotional phone calls, including pre-recorded calls, to users without their consent, as reported by numerous complaints to the Italian DPA (GPDP).

2. Under Article 6 of the GDPR, processing of personal data (including for direct marketing) must be lawful, which requires a valid legal basis such as consent. Article 7 specifies that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, and the data subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time.

3. The complaints indicate that users did not provide valid consent for these promotional calls, as they were perceived as invasive and aggressive, violating the requirement for freely given consent under Article 7(4), which states that consent should not be bundled with other matters and must be as easy to withdraw as to give.

4. Article 21 of the GDPR grants data subjects the right to object at any time to processing of their personal data for direct marketing, including profiling related to such marketing. The persistent nature of the calls suggests that Enel Energia did not respect these objections, thereby violating Article 21(3), which requires that personal data no longer be processed for direct marketing purposes once an objection is raised.

5. Article 12 requires controllers to provide transparent information and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights. The aggressive and invasive nature of the calls, as reported, indicates a failure to provide clear information and respect data subject rights, violating the principles of transparency and fairness under Article 5(1)(a).

6. The use of pre-recorded calls may involve automated processing, and under Article 22, data subjects have the right not to be subject to solely automated decisions, including profiling, which produce legal effects or similarly significantly affect them. If these calls involved automated decision-making without safeguards, it would further violate GDPR provisions.

7. The Italian DPA's investigation and the numerous complaints confirm that Enel Energia's practices interfered with the privacy rights of data subjects, leading to a breach of multiple GDPR principles, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and the right to object to direct marketing.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy, as Enel Energia failed to obtain valid consent, respect the right to object, and ensure transparent and fair processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes."
"Following the receipt of several marketing SMS from a sender named Dorelan, the data subject tried to stop the unwanted activity by contacting what appeared to be the owner of the Dorelan brand, that is to say the company B&T Spa. The latter, however, claimed to have no involvement in the sending of the SMS and referred the data subject to another third party company, Aimon Srl. The data subject subsequently contacted Aimon in order to exercise their rights of access and objection. However, also Aimon denied any responsibility by claiming that the data subject's contact details had been obtained from other database suppliers.

During the investigation, the Italian DPA verified that B&T Spa had instructed Aimon to send promotional SMS to potential customers. The marketing company then made use of other suppliers who in turn had acquired the databases from third parties. In this succession of steps, based on the model of ""Chinese boxes"", it emerged that the data of the people contacted came from unverified, most likely unlawful collection activity. Just to name a couple, two data brokers had declared their offices in Florida and Switzerland. None of them had ever appointed their own representative in Italy or, to our knowledge, in any other Member State, in violation of Article 27 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 21","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (sending marketing SMS) by multiple entities, including B&T Spa, Aimon Srl, and unidentified data brokers, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 3 (territorial scope), since the data subjects are in the Union and the processing relates to offering goods/services.

2. The data brokers (based in Florida and Switzerland) processing data of EU data subjects failed to appoint a representative in the Union as required by Article 27(1), which states that controllers or processors not established in the Union must designate a representative where Article 3(2) applies (offering goods/services to data subjects in the Union). This constitutes a direct violation.

3. The personal data used for marketing was obtained from unverified, likely unlawful sources, violating Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency) and Article 6 (lawfulness of processing), as no valid legal basis (e.g., consent) was established for the processing.

4. The data subject's rights under Article 15 (right of access) and Article 21 (right to object) were not properly facilitated by the controllers involved, violating Article 12(1)-(3), which requires controllers to provide information on action taken on requests without undue delay and within one month.

5. B&T Spa, as the controller that instructed the marketing campaign, failed to ensure that processors (Aimon Srl and subsequent data brokers) provided sufficient guarantees under Article 28(1), and failed to use only processors that comply with GDPR, particularly regarding lawful data sources and appointment of representatives.

6. The chain of data processing involving multiple parties without clear accountability or transparency violates the principle of accountability under Article 5(2) and the requirements for processor engagements under Article 28, where controllers must ensure processors comply with GDPR and process data only on documented instructions.

7. The lack of cooperation and transparent information provided to the data subject about the source of their data (as required by Article 14 where data are not obtained from the data subject) further violates transparency obligations under Articles 13-14.

8. Therefore, the case demonstrates multiple violations of GDPR provisions, including unlawful processing, failure to appoint representatives, infringement of data subject rights, and lack of controller accountability, leading to a conclusion of NONCOMPLIANCE."
"Clearview A.I. Inc. (Clearview) is a company conducting facial recognition on public web sources and is the data controller. Four data subjects had sought information from Clearview under Article 15 GDPR. Clearview replied to three of them and provided “special reports” containing the results obtained through the Clearview software. In 2021, these data subjects complained to the Italian DPA (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali) regarding the processing of their personal data by Clearview, without their consent. In addition, two ""organisations committed to defending the privacy and fundamental rights of individuals"" submitted information about precedents in Germany and Sweden, and their reports on activities of Clearview to the DPA. Based on the press reports on the activities of Clearview and the complaints submitted to it, the DPA opened an investigation.

Before the DPA, Clearview submitted as follows:

The GDPR was not applicable and the DPA lacked jurisdiction as Clearview was not offering its services in Italy and had utilized technical measures to block Italian IP addresses from accessing services of Clearview. Clearview was not carrying out any monitoring activity as per Article 3(2)(b) GDPR, and its search results were akin to Google Search. Clearview did not have a list of Italian customers, and its privacy policy did not refer to GDPR. Clearview did not have a representative in the Union as mandated by Article 27 GDPR. Accordingly, the activities of Clearview were not covered by the GDPR.

Since 2019, law enforcement agencies in the United States (US) were using Clearview, “especially in the context of child pornography investigations”. This generated international interest and several European government agencies signed up for a test account for a short time.

In March 2020, following complaints by regulators in European Union (EU), these test accounts, which were very few, were closed.

Clearview does not have any customers in the EU, and it ensures the same through “specific setting that prevents access to the software via European IP addresses.”

Clearview’s technology is used by law enforcement agencies and assists them in identifying criminals. As per Clearview’s terms, it is the responsibility of its customers to “verify that the use of this product is legitimate in light of the local regulations applicable to it.”

Clearview contractually requires its users to conduct further investigations and independently corroborate information collected using Clearview.

Clearview is based in the US and has no branch in the EU. It neither offers its services in the EU nor monitors behaviour.

Clearview did expand to Canada but ceased all its activities in Canada following the proceedings initiated by the Canadian Privacy Commissioners. This expansion cannot be considered to demonstrate its intention of entering the Italian market.

Journalistic sources cannot be relied upon as they are speculative.

The Swedish decision was concerning the above test accounts that existed for a short period and were available to Swedish police forces.

Clearview did not conduct any behavioural analysis or use any profiling techniques. Collection of data, even of significant volume, does not automatically constitute profiling.

The Data Controller is Clearview’s customer (i.e. police forces) and not Clearview itself, and this was held by the Swedish authority.

Clearview “does not collect or provide any information about the location, browser history, business activity or behaviour of the natural person who appears as a search result and does not imply any behavioural, predictive or analytical modeling. The information that can be obtained about an individual using Clearview's search engine is less meaningful than the information that can be obtained from a Google Search based on that individual's name, and no one is claiming that a Google browser search constitutes behavioral monitoring.”

Clearview is compliant with US law and it is impossible to take into account all existing laws in a globalized world. “Moreover, since Google's search engine is presumed to comply with European laws because Google is established in the EU and offers its services to users in the EU, if the Regulation were also found to apply to Clearview, the processing of the complainant's data should be considered lawful”.

Clearview voluntarily complies with requests for access from European residents, even though it is not bound to do so.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 27","1. The case involves Clearview AI Inc., a data controller processing personal data through facial recognition technology, and data subjects in Italy who exercised their rights under Article 15 GDPR. Clearview argued that GDPR does not apply due to lack of establishment in the EU and blocking of Italian IP addresses.

2. Under Article 3(2) GDPR, the Regulation applies to controllers not established in the Union when processing activities relate to offering goods/services to data subjects in the Union or monitoring their behavior. Clearview's provision of test accounts to European government agencies (even temporarily) constitutes offering services in the Union, making GDPR applicable regardless of IP blocking measures.

3. Clearview processes biometric data (facial images) which qualifies as special category data under Article 9(1) GDPR. Such processing requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or other specific exceptions. Clearview did not obtain consent from data subjects, violating Article 9.

4. Clearview failed to appoint a representative in the Union as required by Article 27 GDPR, given their processing activities relate to offering services to data subjects in multiple Member States (evidenced by test accounts in Sweden and complaints in Italy).

5. The processing lacks a lawful basis under Article 6 GDPR. Clearview's reliance on its customers (law enforcement) to verify legality does not absolve its own responsibility as controller to ensure lawful processing under Article 5(1)(a).

6. Clearview failed to provide proper information to data subjects about processing activities as required by Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, particularly regarding the source of data (public web sources) and purposes of processing.

7. The Swedish precedent referenced by complainants confirms that processing of biometric data by Clearview without valid legal basis violates GDPR principles, supporting the cross-border nature of the violations.

8. Clearview's comparison to Google Search is invalid because Google has establishments in the EU and complies with GDPR requirements for search services, while Clearview operates without such compliance measures.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of territorial scope (Article 3), lawful processing principles (Articles 5 and 6), special category data processing (Article 9), representative appointment (Article 27), and transparency requirements (Articles 13-15)."
"This case was initiated by a data breach notification reported by the Tuscany Region authorities to the Italian DPA (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali – Garante) on 30 July 2020. The breach involved the accidental disclosure of personal data belonging to approximately 3500  candidates participating in a public recruitment competition for administrative assistant job positions.

The Tuscany Region carrying out the contest (the data controller in this case) had a processing agreement with IT company Scanshare S.r.l. for the provision of services related to the organisation and management of the pre-selection phase. The IT company was tasked with processing the data necessary for the completion of the recruitment tests, as well as uploading these on to a server that would host the web page in which each candidate could consult their individual scores.

An email was sent by the processor to a candidate asking for information regarding the publication of the results, which mistakenly contained a link to the web application which was uploading the personal data related to the candidates and their scores, instead of the website where each candidate could log on to obtain their individual results.

The mistakenly sent link to the web application which contained the upload of the entire data set was subsequently circulated among other candidates. From this link, it was possible to access and download, inter alia, the name, surname, date of birth, tax code, detailed results of questionnaires, as well as the overall scores of all the participants. This data was exposed for approximately one hour until the data breach was discovered and remedied. The processor, without consulting the controller, then proceeded to subcontract an IT company named Hostinger, in order to provide it with the logs of the IP addresses which had unauthorised access to the data.

During the Garante’s investigation procedures, the processor claimed that this data breach was not of a malicious nature, and was instead due to a mistake by an employee, due to the fact that the link to website for the candidates, and the one to the web app for the upload of the entire data set, had the same name. It also stated the Hostinger, the third party they had subcontracted to investigate the data breach, in the end was not able to communicate the requested logs, and had no access whatsoever to the personal data and test scores contained on their servers, and hence should not be considered a sub-processor.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves the Tuscany Region as the data controller and Scanshare S.r.l. as the data processor, with personal data being processed for a recruitment competition (Article 4 definitions of 'controller', 'processor', and 'processing').

2. The processor (Scanshare) engaged another processor (Hostinger) without prior specific or general written authorization from the controller (Tuscany Region), which violates Article 28(2) requiring that ""The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller.""

3. The processor failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as the confusion between two similarly named links led to unauthorized disclosure of personal data, violating Article 32(1) on security of processing.

4. The data breach resulted in unauthorized access to special categories of personal data (scores and results revealing candidates' performance capabilities), which constitutes a failure to protect data confidentiality and integrity under Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle).

5. The processor's actions exposed personal data including names, birth dates, tax codes, and test scores without adequate safeguards, failing to implement data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25.

6. The case demonstrates insufficient oversight by the controller regarding the processor's activities, including the unauthorized subcontracting and inadequate security measures, contrary to Article 28(1) requiring controllers to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of Articles 28, 32, and 5 of the GDPR."
"This case was initiated by a data breach notification reported to the Italian DPA (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali – Garante), by a controller, which in this case was the local health authority of Melegnano e della Martesana (L’Azienda socio sanitaria territoriale Melegnano e della Martesana - A.S.S.T.). The data breach concerned the unauthorised disclosure of a medical report to a third party. The data breach did not involve the controller’s IT systems and infrastructures, and was instead due a mistake by an employee, which handed over the wrong physical paper copy of a medical report to another patient.

The controller explained to the Garante that it only became aware of the violation following a communication by the lawyer of the person to whom the aforementioned medical documentation had been mistakenly given to. The controller stated that they had subsequently asked this person to destroy any digital and paper copies that may have been made of it, and to not disclose the contents of the report to any third parties.

Additionally, the controller stated that it had notified the affected data subject that the data breach had occurred, and had also conducted an internal audit to determine the causes for the mistake, revising its internal procedures, and implementing further training courses focused on the correct management of documentation and health data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9","1. The case involves the processing of health data, which is classified as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the policy, requiring stricter protection measures.

2. The data breach occurred due to human error where an employee physically handed the wrong medical report to another patient, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive health information. This violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure.

3. The controller (A.S.S.T.) failed to implement adequate organizational measures under Article 32(1) to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as the breach was caused by a procedural failure in handling physical documents despite the sensitivity of health data.

4. While the controller notified the supervisory authority (Garante) after becoming aware of the breach, Article 33(1) requires such notification to occur without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after awareness. The case does not specify the timeliness of this notification, but the breach itself demonstrates a failure in preventive security measures.

5. The controller took subsequent measures including internal audits, procedure revisions, and staff training, which are positive steps under Article 32(1). However, these were reactive measures taken after the breach occurred, indicating that appropriate safeguards were not initially in place as required by Article 24(1) for ensuring ongoing compliance.

6. The breach involved the disclosure of health data to an unauthorized recipient, which constitutes a violation of Article 9(1) prohibiting processing of special category data without meeting one of the exceptions in Article 9(2). The controller did not demonstrate that any applicable exception justified this disclosure.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to the failure to implement adequate organizational measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive health data, in violation of Articles 5(1)(f), 9(1), and 32(1)."
"A news company named G.O.L. Impresa Sociale S.r.l. published an article in the newspaper Open Online.it reporting on a news story involving the director of a high school (identified by her first name, last name and a photo) and an 18-year-old high school student (referred to by the initials of his first and last name), following the revelation of a love affair between the two, which is currently being investigated by the competent school offices. The article published excerpts of the messages allegedly exchanged between the director and the student related to details of the personal relations between them, placing a particular focus on the contents of these messages.

The story gained wide public notoriety in Italy, and prompted the Italian DPA (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali – Garante) to launch a preliminary investigation into the protection of the personal data of the persons mentioned in the news story, weighed against considerations regarding freedom of expression and information in the context of the journalistic activity carried out by the news company.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 58, Article 85","1. The case involves a news company (G.O.L. Impresa Sociale S.r.l.) processing personal data through journalistic publication, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as it constitutes processing of personal data by automated means (Article 2).

2. The publication included the full first name, last name, and photo of the school director, and the initials of the student, along with excerpts of private messages detailing their personal relations. This processing involves special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), including data concerning a natural person's sex life, which is prohibited unless a specific condition applies.

3. While Article 85 allows Member States to provide exemptions for journalistic purposes, such processing must still be reconciled with data protection rights. The Italian DPA found that the publication exceeded the boundaries of proportionate journalistic activity by unnecessarily revealing intimate details of the personal relationship through message excerpts, violating the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and processing special category data without a valid exemption under Article 9.

4. The processing was not necessary for the purposes of legitimate journalism as it focused excessively on sensationalistic details rather than contributing to a matter of public interest in a proportionate manner, failing to appropriately balance freedom of expression with the data subjects' right to protection of personal data as required under Article 85.

5. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Azienda USL Toscana Centro medical centre (hereinafter “the medical centre” notified the Italian DPA (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali – hereinafter “the Garante”) of a data breach regarding the provision of a physical copy of a medical record to the wrong recipient. According to the medical centre, two separate instances occurred where patients presented an application to acquire a copy of their respective medical records, but due to a mistake by the person in charge of preparing the copies and envelopes, two copies were made of the same medical records, and hence two of the patients received a copy belonging to the other two.

One of the patients which received the wrong medical record contacted the medical centre to inform them of the incident, and the medical centre prompted the patient to return the document, and upon doing so, to also issue a declaration in which he excluded further processing operations such as communication, dissemination and copying of the document. The medical centre also informed the Garante that their data protection official (DPO) also contacted the patient whose medical record was disclosed to the other by mistake, letting them know that the incident had taken place.

After this incident, the medical centre discovered a second incident, and got in contact with both parties in order to retrieve the document from one and get a declaration to exclude further processing, and to inform the patient of the incident and their actions to remedy it.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of special categories of personal data (health data) by Azienda USL Toscana Centro medical center, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 4(1) (definition of personal data) and Article 9(1) (special categories including health data).

2. The medical center failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), given that the same error occurred twice where medical records were provided to incorrect recipients due to human error in preparing copies and envelopes.

3. The incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), defined as ""a breach of security leading to the accidental [...] disclosure of [...] personal data,"" specifically involving unauthorized disclosure of sensitive health information.

4. While the medical center notified the supervisory authority (Garante) of the breach as required by Article 33(1), they failed to properly communicate the breach to the affected data subjects as mandated by Article 34(1), which requires communication ""without undue delay"" when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms.

5. The measures taken by the medical center (retrieving documents and obtaining declarations) were insufficient to mitigate the risks, as the breach had already occurred and the sensitive nature of health data creates inherent high risk, requiring direct communication to data subjects under Article 34.

6. The medical center failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2) by not implementing adequate organizational measures to prevent such errors, particularly since the same mistake occurred multiple times, indicating insufficient staff training and procedural safeguards.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to failures in implementing appropriate security measures, proper breach communication procedures, and demonstrating accountability as required by Articles 5(2), 32, and 34 of the GDPR."
"The data controller used the whistleblowing application “WB confidential” for the organizational acquisition and management of reports on illegal conduct by its employees and other stakeholders. The application was operated by a SaaS supplier that acted as a processor for the controller in accordance with Article 28 GDPR.

The delivered reports could contain the identification data of the whistleblower, information relating to the report and any attached documentation. Due to the limited number of reports and data processed, however, the controller decided to not carry out an data protection impact assessment. Similarly, because of the “little use"" for any third parties and the ""extremely low probability of threats” the controller decided to not encrypt the personal data stored within its database and transmitted over the public network.

In motivating its decision, the controller held that adopting the measure of encryption was only applicable and adequate in cases of large volumes of processing data in specific subjective areas. The implementation of such a functionality had required the purchase of an additional component with disproportionate implementation costs. Also, technical access was reserved exclusively for the processor, who had no interest in communicating or disseminating any data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32, Article 35","1. The case involves a data controller processing personal data through a whistleblowing application, which includes identification data of whistleblowers and report details, constituting personal data as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller decided not to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) as required under Article 35(1), citing the limited number of reports and data processed. However, Article 35(1) mandates a DPIA where processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Whistleblowing processing often involves sensitive information and potential risks to individuals, such as retaliation or privacy breaches, which should have been assessed regardless of volume.

3. Article 35(3) specifies that a DPIA is particularly required for processing that involves systematic monitoring of individuals or large-scale processing of special categories of data. While the controller argued that the volume was limited, the nature of whistleblowing could constitute systematic monitoring under Article 35(3)(c), and the controller failed to demonstrate that the processing did not pose a high risk, thus violating Article 35.

4. The controller decided not to encrypt personal data stored and transmitted, as per Article 32(1), which requires appropriate technical and organizational measures, including encryption, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The controller justified this based on ""little use"" for third parties, ""extremely low probability of threats,"" and disproportionate implementation costs.

5. However, Article 32(1) requires that security measures take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risk to individuals. Whistleblowing data is often sensitive and requires robust protection against unauthorized access or disclosure, especially when transmitted over public networks. The controller's cost argument does not override the obligation to implement measures proportionate to the risk, as per Article 32(2), which emphasizes risks like unauthorized disclosure.

6. Article 32(2) specifically states that in assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken of the risks presented by processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure. By not encrypting, the controller failed to address these risks adequately.

7. The controller's argument that technical access is reserved for the processor who has no interest in disseminating data is insufficient, as Article 32 requires measures to protect against any unauthorized access, including by processors or through breaches, and processors must comply with security obligations under Article 28.

8. The controller's decisions also violate the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25(1), which requires implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to effectively implement data protection principles and integrate necessary safeguards.

9. Therefore, based on the violations of Article 35 (DPIA), Article 32 (security measures), and Article 25 (data protection by design), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The company 'aiComply Srl' (the ‘Processor’) provided the Airport of Bologna (the ‘Controller’) with the whistleblowing application “WB confidential” for the organizational acquisition and management of reports on illegal conduct by its employees and other stakeholders. The processor further offered maintenance of the application through two other companies, ‘Agic Technology Srl’ carrying specialist assistance activities and ‘A1Tech Srl’ carrying out the management of the IT-infrastructure.

Investigations of the DPA found, that personal data transferred and stored within the application was not encrypted. Furthermore, it was verified that all three processing companies shared a non-nominal “System-Administrator” profile for the application. In this regard, aiComply had never informed the airport about this relationship with the two sub-processors.

aiComply argued, that suitable security measures and especially encryption, had not be considered due to an extraordinarily limited amount of processing relating to only few reports transmitted through the system. Accordingly, the application was sufficiently protected by a firewall and an only internal or VPN access. It was negotiated with the airport that no further security measures shall be adopted. The processor also argued, that both involved companies for the maintenance did not process any personal data due to carrying out only technical activities and were generally appointed as suppliers of system administration tasks by aiComply.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves aiComply Srl acting as a processor for the Airport of Bologna (controller) under GDPR, as defined in Article 4(8), and involves processing of personal data through a whistleblowing application.

2. Article 28(2) requires that processors not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorization from the controller. aiComply used two sub-processors (Agic Technology Srl and A1Tech Srl) without informing the Airport of Bologna, violating this requirement.

3. Article 28(3) mandates that processing by a processor be governed by a contract stipulating that the processor ensures persons authorized to process personal data are committed to confidentiality. The shared non-nominal ""System-Administrator"" profile among three companies risks unauthorized access and breaches confidentiality obligations.

4. Article 32(1) requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including encryption of personal data. The lack of encryption, justified by aiComply based on low data volume, does not align with the risk-based approach required by GDPR, especially for sensitive whistleblowing data.

5. Article 29 states that any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor shall not process personal data except on instructions from the controller. The involvement of multiple companies with shared administrator access without clear instructions from the controller violates this principle.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 28(2), 28(3), 29, and 32(1) of the GDPR."
"The GPDP launched an investigation into the parking meters operated by the Municipality of Rome. According to a report, users had to enter the license plate of their vehicle to obtain the parking ticket.

It found some parking meters under management had recently been modernised to allow card payments and the personalisation of payments to stop users of the service from needing to display tickets. The latter required users to enter their license plates into the meters. The system underpinning this was operated by Atac s.p.a. The company collected information (e.g. the time, the start and end date of the stop, the amount paid and the license plate) relating to the payment of the parking, which was facilitated by more intermediary companies, and made it available both to traffic auxiliaries for the purposes of verifying the payment of the parking as well as to the company's internal staff for administrative management purposes.

The DPA notified Roma Capitale that it had discovered some breaches and invited the municipality to produce defensive writings. It stated that the municipality had effectively put in place a system that (1) processed the personal data collected through the new parking meters installed in the area (2) without providing data subjects adequate information, (3) without defining the roles of the external companies involved in the processing, (4) without defining the storage times of the data collected and (5) without having adopted appropriate security measures, in violation of Articles 5, 12, 13, 25, 28 and 32 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (license plate numbers) by the Municipality of Rome through parking meters managed by Atac s.p.a. and intermediary companies, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The GPDP found that data subjects were not provided with adequate information about the processing of their personal data. Article 13 requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information including the identity of the controller, the purposes of processing, the legal basis, and the rights of the data subject, among others. The failure to provide this information constitutes a violation of Article 13.

3. The roles of the external companies involved in the processing (as processors) were not properly defined. Article 28 requires that processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or other legal act that stipulates the subject-matter, duration, nature, and purpose of processing, and ensures the processor acts only on documented instructions from the controller. The lack of such definitions violates Article 28.

4. The storage times of the collected data were not defined. Article 5(1)(e) (the storage limitation principle) requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. The failure to define storage times violates this principle.

5. Appropriate security measures were not adopted to protect the personal data processed. Article 32 requires that the controller and processor implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures such as pseudonymisation, encryption, and ensuring confidentiality. The lack of such measures violates Article 32.

6. Additionally, the failure to implement data protection by design and by default, as required by Article 25, is implied by the system's overall non-compliance, particularly in not minimizing data processing and not integrating necessary safeguards from the onset.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy due to violations of Articles 5, 12, 13, 25, 28, and 32."
"The hospital (the controller) organized an open competition. Due to a technical problem, the the participants' personal data, including health data, was published on the controller's website. It appears from the proceedings that a part of the controller's technical infrastructure was managed by a third party, especially for the handling of online job applications . The controller argues that it has no responsibility as the conduct is entirely attributable to the malpractice of the third party company.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 28, Article 32","1. The hospital is the controller as defined in Article 4, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data through its open competition.
2. The processed data includes health data, which is a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), requiring higher protection standards.
3. Article 24 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR, regardless of whether processing is carried out by third parties.
4. Article 28(1) mandates that controllers use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that meet GDPR requirements.
5. Article 28(3) requires a binding contract between controller and processor that stipulates the processor must process data only on documented instructions from the controller and implement appropriate security measures.
6. Article 32 requires both controller and processor to implement appropriate security measures considering the risks, including against unauthorized disclosure of personal data.
7. The data breach occurred due to a technical problem in infrastructure managed by a third-party processor, resulting in unauthorized publication of sensitive health data.
8. Under Article 82(2), the controller remains primarily liable for damage caused by processing infringements, regardless of processor involvement.
9. The controller's attempt to shift full responsibility to the third-party processor violates the accountability principle in Article 5(2) and specific controller obligations under Articles 24 and 28.
10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Between April 2016 and July 2017, Unicredit S.p.A., one of the major banking groups in Italy, suffered two data breaches to its system, which affected the personal data of more than 700.000 customers. In July 2017 the Bank informed the Italian DPA, as well as all the customers involved, about the data breaches. The DPA immediately started a proper investigation on it and found that the breaches were caused by the use of employees' credentials of a financial partner, Penta Finanziamenti Italia S.r.l., through a software called Speedy Arena. It is still not clear whether the breaches were directly caused by the partner's employees or the mentioned credentials had been stolen and used by an external third party.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Unicredit S.p.A. as a data controller processing personal data of customers, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment in the Union (Italy).

2. The data breaches affected over 700,000 customers, indicating a large-scale processing operation that requires enhanced security measures under Article 32, which mandates appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

3. The breaches were caused by the use of employees' credentials of a financial partner, Penta Finanziamenti Italia S.r.l., through third-party software. Under Article 28, when using a processor (or a partner effectively acting as a processor), the controller must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate security measures and ensure the protection of data subjects' rights. The case does not indicate that Unicredit ensured such guarantees or had a proper data processing agreement in place, constituting a violation.

4. Article 33 requires that in the case of a personal data breach, the controller must notify the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The breaches occurred between April 2016 and July 2017, but Unicredit only informed the DPA in July 2017, indicating a significant delay in notification for the first breach, which violates the undue delay requirement.

5. Article 34 requires that when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. Unicredit notified customers in July 2017, but the breach period started over a year earlier, suggesting a failure to communicate in a timely manner, especially for the first breach.

6. The investigation revealed that the breaches were caused by credentials of a partner, indicating potential insufficient access controls and security measures, which violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) and the specific security requirements under Article 32.

7. The lack of clarity on whether the breaches were caused by the partner's employees or external third parties further suggests inadequate monitoring and security protocols, failing to meet the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the obligation to demonstrate compliance.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The municipal district of Casaloldo (the 'District') has organized an open competition in order to fulfill a public role. After the written exams, the District published the results and the various scores of all the applicants through its website in order to guarantee the transparency of the procedure.

One of the unsuccessful applicants made a complaint to the Garante claiming that District had made inappropriate and unlawful use of his information, with the publication of his name and his score publicly available.

The Garante promptly started an investigation in order to have more details from the District, which, following the mentioned complaint, immediately removed the information of all the unsuccessful candidates from the official website of the District.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the municipal district of Casaloldo (the District) as a controller processing personal data (names and scores of applicants) in the context of a public competition, as defined under Article 4(7) of the GDPR policy.

2. The District published the personal data (names and scores) of all applicants on its website for transparency purposes, which constitutes processing under Article 4(2) of the GDPR policy.

3. According to Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR policy, personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. The publication of individual names and scores of unsuccessful applicants may be considered unfair, as it could lead to unnecessary exposure and potential harm to the data subjects without a compelling justification.

4. Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR policy requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization). The publication of detailed scores and names of all applicants, including unsuccessful ones, exceeds what is necessary for transparency, as transparency could be achieved through less intrusive means, such as publishing only the list of successful applicants or aggregated data.

5. The processing must have a lawful basis under Article 6 of the GDPR policy. While the District, as a public authority, might rely on Article 6(1)(e) (processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest), the extent of processing—publishing individual names and scores—is not proportionate or necessary for the transparency purpose, thus violating the principle of lawfulness.

6. The data subject (the unsuccessful applicant) exercised their right to complain under Article 77 of the GDPR policy, indicating an infringement of their rights, and the District's subsequent removal of the data suggests acknowledgment of the issue.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to violations of the principles of fairness (Article 5(1)(a)) and data minimization (Article 5(1)(c))."
"The Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali, Italy’s DPA, led an investigation into Vodafone Italy S.p.A following various complaints by Vodafone users and non-users, which highlighted multiple issues on the phone company’s practices.

The first group of claimants complained about constant unwanted promotional phone calls and SMS from Vodafone, with one example being a person claiming that they have been receiving at least 4/5 messages a month by Vodafone since 2018, even after he communicated to the company that he no longer wanted to receive such messages. Vodafone blamed this last mishap on a “system error” that failed to register the client’s request to stop the promotional messages.

The second set of complaints concerned the way that the company stored their client’s data. More specifically, costumers complained about being approached by Vodafone operators, usually after reporting issues with their internet service. However, it turned out that those were call-centres that worked for other phone companies or third party callers that used Vodafone’s logo in their WhatsApp profile. These unauthorized individuals would often ask about the issues the users reported, point out that Vodafone would increase their costumer service fees and offer to subscribe the user to a different phone provider. Other times, they would just request for the user’s IDs, possibly for fraudulent or phishing purposes. Vodafone claimed to have been aware of these practices in the past, confirmed that those were indeed unauthorized parties under false pretences, and explained that they were trying to improve security on their databases by applying 2 Factor Authentication.

Lastly, several users complained that Vodafone was not responding appropriately to their requests in exercise of their rights under Articles 15-22 GDPR. For example, one user complained that Vodafone had not replied at all to a request sent to them via email. Another one explained that Vodafone did reply, but did not promptly correct the user’s personal information as requested, therefore breaching Article 16 GDPR. A last user complained that Vodafone refused to provide the client with information about the purposes of processing his personal data under Article 15(1) because he did not provide them with appropriate Identification, as he used a document with a digital signature.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 15, Article 16, Article 21, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves Vodafone Italy S.p.A., a data controller processing personal data of data subjects (its customers and non-customers), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2.

2. Regarding the first set of complaints about unwanted promotional communications:
   - Data subjects have the right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes at any time under Article 21(2) and (3). Once objected, the personal data must no longer be processed for such purposes.
   - Vodafone failed to honor a data subject's objection and continued processing for direct marketing due to a ""system error,"" which constitutes a violation of Article 21(3). This also violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

3. Regarding the second set of complaints about data storage and unauthorized access:
   - The controller is obligated to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk under Article 32(1). This includes the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality and integrity of processing systems.
   - Vodafone's failure to prevent unauthorized third parties from accessing customer data (as evidenced by fraudulent call centers obtaining customer information) demonstrates a breach of the security principle under Article 5(1)(f) and a specific violation of Article 32.
   - The controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with these principles (accountability, Article 5(2)), which Vodafone failed to do despite being aware of these practices.

4. Regarding the third set of complaints about handling data subject rights requests:
   - Under Article 12(3), the controller must provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15-22 without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt.
   - Vodafone's complete failure to respond to one request violates Article 12(3).
   - Under Article 16, the controller must rectify inaccurate personal data without undue delay. Vodafone's failure to promptly correct a user's personal information constitutes a violation of this article.
   - While controllers can request additional information to confirm identity under Article 12(6), refusing a valid request solely because a document had a digital signature (a common and secure authentication method) without reasonable justification appears disproportionate and may violate the controller's obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2).

5. The cumulative effect of these violations—failing to respect the right to object, inadequate security measures leading to unauthorized data access, and systematic failures in responding to data subject rights requests—demonstrates a pattern of non-compliance with multiple core provisions of the GDPR.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"With a previous measure (n. 81 of 7 March 2019) the Garante already declared the unlawfulness of the processing activity deployed by the Municipality of Rome via the use of the system ""TuPassi"".

In that occasion, the Garante found that the processing was in violation of:

* The principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, f. Article 5(1)(a) 
* The obligation of providing a privacy notice to the data subjects as by Articles 13 and 14 
* The obligation to regulate the relation with the processor as by  Article 28(2) and (3) 
* The obligation to adopt technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing as by Article 32. 

The processing involved a large amount of personal data, including sensitive ones related to bookings of various healthcare services. The system acquired and stored on the servers of the Municipality for a long period of time, numerous users' personal data relating to reservations (type of service, channel used, date and time of the reservation) and of the staff employed in the management of appointments.

The system also recorded and generated daily reports containing detailed information of the work activity (date, type of service, name of the counter attendant, call time and waiting time). All operations were carried out without the users or employees having received complete information on the processing made possible by the application. The DPA also considered the technical and organizational measures implemented by the Municipality to be inadequate insofar as they did not regulate the relationship with the service provider.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 14, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves the Municipality of Rome acting as a controller processing personal data through the ""TuPassi"" system, which includes sensitive data related to healthcare bookings, as defined under Article 4 of the policy (definitions of 'controller' and 'personal data').

2. The processing of sensitive data, such as health-related information, falls under special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1), which prohibits such processing unless a condition under Article 9(2) applies. The case does not indicate that any lawful basis, such as explicit consent or necessity for healthcare purposes, was established, thus violating Article 9.

3. The Garante found a violation of Article 5(1)(a), as the processing was not lawful, fair, or transparent. Specifically, users and employees were not adequately informed about the processing activities, and the lack of transparency undermines the fairness principle.

4. Articles 13 and 14 require controllers to provide data subjects with comprehensive information about the processing, including purposes, legal basis, and data retention periods. The case states that users and employees did not receive complete information, directly violating these articles.

5. Article 28(2) and (3) mandate that controllers must have a contract or other legal act with processors that outlines the subject-matter, duration, and security measures of processing. The case indicates that the relationship with the service provider (processor) was not properly regulated, constituting a violation.

6. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The Garante deemed these measures inadequate, especially given the sensitive nature of the data, leading to a violation.

7. The storage of personal data for a long period without justification may also contravene the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), though not explicitly stated in the case, it supports the overall noncompliance.

8. Therefore, due to multiple violations of key GDPR provisions, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A 10 year old person taking part in the “blackout challenge” died.

The “blackout challenge” is an internet phenomenon in which participants film themselves in an autoerotic asphyxiation. This practice is one of the most dangerous and extreme practices of BDSM. Becuase of the carotid sinus reflex, cardiac arrest can occur in certain cases.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 58, Article 66","1. The case involves the processing of personal data related to a minor (10-year-old child) participating in the ""blackout challenge"" through information society services (online platforms hosting such content), which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3, as the processing likely occurs in the context of offering services to data subjects in the Union.

2. Under Article 8(1), processing of personal data of a child below age 16 in relation to information society services requires consent given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility. The platform hosting the challenge failed to implement reasonable efforts to verify parental consent (Article 8(2)), as the child accessed and participated in the dangerous content without such verification.

3. The processing violates Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle) and Article 32 (security of processing), as the platform allowed dissemination of content promoting life-threatening activities without adequate safeguards to prevent minors from accessing harmful material, resulting in actual harm (death of the child).

4. The platform likely violated Article 25 (data protection by design and by default) by not implementing technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose is processed, particularly failing to restrict access to dangerous content for minors.

5. Under Article 35(1), a data protection impact assessment was required for this high-risk processing (given the nature of content promoting self-harm), which the platform failed to conduct, as evidenced by the occurrence of fatal harm.

6. The processing violates Article 6(1) (lawfulness of processing) as there is no lawful basis for facilitating life-threatening challenges, especially for children, and it contradicts the fundamental rights protections under Article 1.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations involving inadequate parental consent verification, insufficient safety measures, lack of impact assessment, and failure to protect the child's right to life and data protection."
"With a previous measure (n. 81 of 7 march 2019) the Garante declared the unlawfulness of the processing activity deployed by the Municipality of Rome using the system ""TuPassi"" provided by Miropass s.r.l..

Consequently, the Garante carried out an investigation on the platform ""TuPassi"" provided by Miropass s.r.l.; in its investigation the Garante noted the absence of:  - a suitable prerequisite of lawfulness, in violation of article 5(a), 6 and 9 GDPR

* definition of the data retention period, in violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR  
* adequate definition of the relationship with a sub-processor, in violation of Article 28 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 28","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the Municipality of Rome using the ""TuPassi"" system provided by Miropass s.r.l., which qualifies as a controller-processor relationship under GDPR definitions (Article 4(7) and (8)).

2. The Garante found the processing lacked a suitable prerequisite of lawfulness. Under Article 5(1)(a), personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Article 6 requires at least one lawful basis for processing, and Article 9 imposes stricter conditions for processing special categories of data. The absence of a defined lawful basis violates these provisions.

3. The case specifically notes the absence of a defined data retention period. Article 5(1)(e) requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary, and the controller must define storage periods or criteria for determining them. The failure to do so constitutes a violation.

4. The investigation found inadequate definition of the relationship with a sub-processor. Article 28 requires that processing by a processor be governed by a contract or other legal act that specifies the subject-matter, duration, nature, and purpose of processing, among other obligations. The absence of such a contract or its inadequacy violates this article.

5. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to violations of Article 5(1)(a) and (e), Article 6, Article 9, and Article 28 of the GDPR."
"The case involves the processing of citizens’ health data by Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale Toscana Sud Est (hereafter simply ‘USL’), a local public health body, as part of a broader initiative from Tuscany Region related to the monitoring of chronic diseases in the population. The facts – as emerged from an initial notice received from a general practitioner (hereafter ‘GP’), the following investigation from the Italian DPA, and the information provided by the public body – read as follows.

In the context of the above-mentioned public health approach, health data was shared among several public healthcare stakeholders, including general practitioners (GPs) and public clinics, coordinated by the USL. Initially, GPs sent to the USL only aggregated data pertaining to specific diseases. Until 2018, however, the USL asked GPs to fill in an Excel file with the names of the patients and their pathologies. After having gathered patients’ consent, GPs filled in the file, embedded it in a password-protected zip archive, and shared it with ‘district physicians’ via a USB drive stick. The file was then copied on the district physician’s PC and sent via email to a district physician who is competent for the whole area, who eventually sent it via the same mean to an administrative body named ‘ESTAR’. ESTAR is a data processor which manages a ‘data warehouse’ and makes data form the program available to the USL, for monitoring purposes, via a ‘data mart’. Before entering the data warehouse, data were pseudonymised using an existing regional identifier.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 14, Article 28, Article 30, Article 35, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of health data, which is classified as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the policy, requiring stricter safeguards and lawful bases for processing.

2. The processing relied on patient consent as the lawful basis under Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a). However, consent for processing special category data must be explicit, specific, and freely given. The case lacks details on how consent was obtained, but the transfer methods used (USB drives and unencrypted email) suggest inadequate security measures, potentially undermining the validity of consent as it may not meet the requirements of being informed and freely given under Articles 4(11), 6, 7, and 9.

3. The transfer of personal data via USB drives and unencrypted email violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized access. Additionally, Article 32(1) mandates implementing technical measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, such as encryption, which was not applied during data transmission.

4. The involvement of ESTAR as a data processor requires a binding contract under Article 28(3) that specifies processing instructions, security measures, and other obligations. The case does not mention such a contract, indicating a violation of Article 28.

5. The pseudonymization process occurred only after data reached the data warehouse, meaning identifiable data (names and pathologies) were transmitted and processed without pseudonymization initially, contravening the principles of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) and privacy by design under Article 25(1).

6. As a public health body, the USL must comply with additional obligations under Article 9(2)(h) and (i) for processing health data, which require safeguards like professional secrecy and specific measures. The use of insecure transfer methods (e.g., email and USB drives) fails to provide these safeguards.

7. The case does not indicate that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was conducted under Article 35, which is required for processing health data on a large scale, given the systematic monitoring of chronic diseases across the population.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 5, 6, 7, 9, 25, 28, 32, and 35."
"Following a data breach notification from ARPAC, the Italian DPA started a proceeding aimed at checking the security measures implemented by the notifier.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a data breach notification from ARPAC to the Italian DPA (supervisory authority), which triggered an investigation into the security measures implemented by ARPAC as the data controller, as required under Article 33 of the GDPR regarding notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities.

2. The GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures such as pseudonymisation, encryption, and regular testing of security measures, as stipulated in Article 32(1) of the GDPR.

3. Under Article 5(2) (the accountability principle) and Article 24(1) of the GDPR, the controller must be able to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation, including the implementation of appropriate security measures based on the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

4. The verdict of NONCOMPLIANT indicates that the Italian DPA found ARPAC's security measures to be insufficient or inadequate for the processing activities being carried out, meaning ARPAC failed to meet the requirements of Article 32(1) of the GDPR.

5. Additionally, if the breach involved special categories of data (as defined in Article 9) or personal data relating to criminal convictions (Article 10), the controller would have additional obligations to implement appropriate safeguards, which may have been lacking in this case.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy as ARPAC failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing as required by Article 32 of the GDPR."
"Following some news in 2019 about the adoption of a system based on biometric data to detect employees' attendance, the Garante started an investigation upon the Provincial Health Department (ASP) in Enna. According to the ASP:

(a) the collection of biometrics did not consist of personal data processing, since it begins (in an automated manner) if and when (and only when) the employee initiates the process himself by carrying out two material operations that are under his personal and exclusive control (placing the badge on the reader and placing of the fingertip on the scanner);

(b) ASP informed employees of the adoption of this measure to detect attendance and the relevant collection of biometric data;

(c) the processing was based on employees' consent and following the prescriptions of Law n. 56/2019 aimed at preventing absenteeism on the workplace.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves the processing of biometric data (fingertip scanning) by the Provincial Health Department (ASP) in Enna, which qualifies as processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) of the policy, as biometric data is explicitly listed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person.

2. ASP claimed the processing did not constitute personal data processing because employees initiated it through specific actions. However, Article 4 defines processing as ""any operation performed on personal data, including collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,"" which clearly includes the automated collection of biometric data through fingerprint scanning.

3. ASP relied on employee consent as the legal basis for processing under Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a). However, Recital 43 states that consent is not freely given when there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and controller, such as in an employment context. Since ASP is the employer, the power imbalance undermines the validity of consent.

4. Article 88(1) specifically addresses processing in the employment context, requiring Member States to provide more specific rules to protect employees' rights. While ASP referenced Law n. 56/2019 aimed at preventing absenteeism, the policy requires that any such legal basis must be proportionate and include suitable safeguards, which was not demonstrated in this case.

5. The principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary. The use of biometric data for attendance tracking may be considered excessive when less intrusive means (e.g., badge-only systems) are available, and ASP did not justify the necessity of biometric processing.

6. Article 35(1) requires a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for processing likely to result in high risk to rights and freedoms, particularly when using special categories of data like biometrics. There is no indication that ASP conducted a DPIA prior to implementing the system.

7. ASP claimed to have informed employees about the processing, which aligns with Article 13 requirements. However, the invalidity of consent and the lack of a proper legal basis under Article 6 and Article 9 render this information insufficient to legitimize the processing.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to the invalid reliance on consent in an employment context, the absence of a proper legal basis under Article 9, the potential violation of data minimization principles, and the failure to conduct a required DPIA."
"The data processor working for the company, inadvertently shared hospital discharge letters with related drug therapies from some patients with other patients by including them in the latter’s own Electronic Health Record.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9","1. The case involves a data processor working for a company inadvertently sharing hospital discharge letters and related drug therapies of some patients with other patients by including them in the latter's Electronic Health Records, which constitutes unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal data.

2. The disclosed data (hospital discharge letters and drug therapies) qualify as health data under Article 4(15) and fall under special categories of personal data according to Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless specific conditions are met.

3. The inadvertent sharing occurred without any lawful basis under Article 9(2) (such as explicit consent, necessity for health treatment, or other valid exceptions), making the processing unlawful under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 9(1).

4. As a processor handling sensitive health data, the entity failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 32(1) to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent accidental disclosure of personal data.

5. The processor violated Article 29 by processing personal data contrary to the controller's instructions, as the inadvertent sharing was not an authorized processing activity under the controller-processor relationship defined in Article 28(3)(a).

6. This incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12) (unauthorized disclosure of personal data), requiring notification to the controller without undue delay under Article 33(2), though the breach itself represents a failure in data protection measures regardless of notification.

7. The breach infringes on data subjects' rights under Articles 15-22, particularly the right to data protection and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), as personal health data was wrongfully disclosed to unauthorized parties.

8. The controller remains ultimately responsible under Article 5(2) (principle of accountability) for failures by their processor, as they must ensure processors provide sufficient guarantees under Article 28(1) to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to unlawful processing of special category data, inadequate security measures, processor protocol violations, and failure to protect against unauthorized disclosure."
"The inquiry from the Garante originated from a data breach notification received by Azienda USL della Romagna on 19 December 2019, for a violation occurred on 1 March 2019 of which the health care provider officially became aware on 17 December 2019. This was only after the data subject claimed for damages, and the provider carried out an internal inquiry.

As the patient was admitted to the gynaecology ward, she asked that no information related to her health status be revealed to any third party. For this purpose, she provided a personal phone number. After her discharge, a tried to contact her in order to give her information about a treatment, but used a different phone number found on the front page of the patient’s medical record, and hence found herself talking to her husband. The information disclosed to the patient's husband only concerned the type of ward to which the patient was admitted.

During the DPA’s investigation, the provider disclosed that the nurse had been formally authorised to process personal data, and she was provided with operating instructions to properly process personal data. Additionally, the USL presented that the procedure to record the health data of the patient was not computerised. Hence, although the form signed by the data subject and containing her refusal to provide information about her health to third parties was included in the medical record, the medical record itself showed on the front page a telephone number that the patient had given to the provider before her hospitalization.

Concerning the data breach itself, the USL reported that the nurse should have communicated with the patient in person at the hospital, right after her release, but she was interrupted by a call from another patient and hence asked the data subject to wait. After having found out that the patient actually left the hospital, the nurse then quickly tried to contact the patient, finding in the company registry the telephone number to contact her.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a healthcare provider (Azienda USL della Romagna) processing sensitive health data of a patient, which falls under the definition of ""special categories of personal data"" under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, requiring heightened protection.

2. The patient explicitly exercised her right to restrict disclosure of her health information to third parties by providing a specific contact number and making a formal request, which should have been honored under Article 9(2)(a) (explicit consent requirements) and Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency principle).

3. The nurse accessed and used an outdated telephone number from the front page of the medical record instead of the current number provided by the patient, violating:
   - Article 5(1)(d) (accuracy principle: personal data must be accurate and kept up to date)
   - Article 32 (security of processing: failure to implement appropriate technical measures to ensure data accuracy and prevent unauthorized disclosure)

4. The disclosure of health information (even limited to the ward admission) to the husband without consent constitutes:
   - A violation of Article 9(1) (prohibition on processing special category data without explicit consent or other lawful basis)
   - A breach of Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle: unauthorized disclosure)

5. The provider's delayed discovery and reporting of the breach (from March to December 2019) violates:
   - Article 33(1) (obligation to notify supervisory authority within 72 hours of awareness)
   - Article 5(2) (accountability principle: failure to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles)

6. The manual record-keeping system that allowed outdated contact information to remain accessible demonstrates:
   - Failure to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25
   - Inadequate organizational measures under Article 32 to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and accuracy of personal data

7. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"Following some reports, the Italian DPA ascertained that the MISE uploaded on its website a list of more than 5,000 managers containing their personal data, including name, tax code, e-mail address, CV, mobile phone and, in some cases, ID and health card. All this data was freely visible and downloadable. The MISE published that list to help SMEs in booking advice from experienced business professionals on the technological and digital processes to manage vouchers provided in compliance with the 2019 Budget Law.

The DPA has also found that the MISE did not appoint a DPO by May 25, 2018, as required for all public bodies according to art. 37 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 37","1. The case involves the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE), which is a public authority and thus subject to GDPR as a controller under Article 4(7) and within the territorial scope of Article 3.

2. MISE processed personal data of managers by uploading it to a website where it was freely visible and downloadable, including names, tax codes, email addresses, CVs, mobile phones, and in some cases ID and health cards. This processing likely included special categories of personal data, such as data concerning health from health cards, which falls under Article 9(1), and requires a lawful basis under Article 9(2). MISE did not demonstrate a lawful basis for processing such sensitive data, violating Article 9.

3. The publication of personal data without adequate security measures, such as access controls or encryption, violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires appropriate security against unauthorized or unlawful processing.

4. Making personal data freely accessible and downloadable exceeds the stated purpose of helping SMEs book advice, violating the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b) and data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the data processed was not limited to what is necessary for the purpose.

5. MISE, as a public authority, is required under Article 37(1)(a) to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) by May 25, 2018. The case states that MISE did not appoint a DPO, which is a direct violation of Article 37.

6. The lack of a DPO may have contributed to failures in implementing data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, and in ensuring appropriate security measures under Article 32.

7. Therefore, based on violations of multiple GDPR articles, including Article 5, Article 9, Article 32, and Article 37, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Italian national social security institute (INPS) has provided financial aids to Italian citizens in order to face the Covid crisis. To access this aids, citizens were required to satisfy certain criteria. The INPS, in order to speed up the process to obtain the aid, first assessed the request only on the basis of the documentation provided in the request by the applicant, and just in a second moment, after the dispensing of the aid, carried out a more specific investigation for every applicant.

During the second phase assessment, the INPS checked whether between the requests there were parliamentarians or holders of offices in public administrations. To do so, INPS collected some personal data from open source registers and generated from this open data the personal tax code of the applicants and compared it with the one in the application. This way of calculation of the tax code can entail some mistakes. The secondary examination was carried on also for the subjects to which the aid was already been refused under the first examination. Only afterwards, the Labour ministry declared that parliamentarians and holders of administrative office would be excluded from this financial aid.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 35","1. The case involves the Italian national social security institute (INPS) processing personal data of applicants for financial aid during the Covid crisis, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it constitutes processing of personal data by a public authority.

2. INPS collected personal data from open source registers and generated tax codes of applicants without obtaining this data directly from the data subjects. According to Article 14, where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information to the data subject within a reasonable period, including the categories of personal data concerned and the source from which the data originate. There is no indication that INPS provided this information to the data subjects, violating Article 14.

3. The processing involved generating tax codes from open data, which the case acknowledges can entail mistakes. Article 5(1)(d) requires that personal data be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, with every reasonable step taken to ensure that inaccurate data are erased or rectified without delay. The method used by INPS risked inaccuracies without adequate safeguards, violating the accuracy principle.

4. The processing targeted special categories of data, as checking for parliamentarians and holders of public offices involves processing data related to political opinions or membership (Article 9(1)). Such processing is prohibited unless it meets one of the exceptions in Article 9(2). The case does not indicate that any exception, such as explicit consent or substantial public interest with appropriate safeguards, was met, thus violating Article 9.

5. INPS processed data for a secondary examination even for subjects who had already been refused aid, which may not be necessary for the original purpose of financial aid distribution. Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation) requires that personal data be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes. This extended processing appears to lack a lawful basis and compatibility with the original purpose.

6. The Labour Ministry's declaration excluding parliamentarians and office holders came only after INPS had already processed the data. This indicates that the processing was not based on a clear legal basis at the time it occurred, violating Article 6(1), which requires that processing be lawful under at least one of the specified conditions, such as legal obligation or public interest.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 5 (accuracy and purpose limitation), Article 6 (lawfulness), Article 9 (processing of special categories), and Article 14 (information to be provided when data are not obtained from the data subject)."
"Following hundreds of complaints for continuous and insistent unwanted telephone calls from Fastweb with the aim of promoting its offers, the Italian DPA opened an Investigation.

The Garante found out firstly, that a large part of the telephone numbers selected came from abusive call centers that process personal data without respecting GDPR. Secondly, the Garante found out a wrongful management of contact lists, provided to Fastweb by external partners, without the latter having acquired the free, specific and informed consent of data subjects to the processing of their data. Thirdly, the Garante also noted the absence of adequate security measures for customer management systems. In fact, many users reported that they had been contacted by false Fastweb operators probably for the purpose of spamming, phishing and for carrying out other fraudulent activities. Other critical issues were found by the Guarantor in the promotional activity carried out by Fastweb in partnership with another party (e.g. Eni Gas e Luce S.p.A.) for using customer lists provided by the latter without consent to the marketing activity. Other violations concerned procedures adopted for the “Call me back” service, which prevented users from giving free, specific and informed consent and from deactivating the service in an automated manner.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves Fastweb, a controller processing personal data for marketing purposes, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data in the context of commercial activities.

2. The processing of personal data for marketing purposes requires a lawful basis under Article 6. For marketing calls, consent is typically required under Article 6(1)(a), which must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous as per Article 4(11) and Article 7.

3. The Garante found that Fastweb used contact lists provided by external partners without obtaining valid consent from data subjects for marketing activities. This violates Article 6(1)(a), as processing without consent is unlawful, and Article 7, which requires controllers to be able to demonstrate that consent was given.

4. Additionally, Article 21 provides data subjects with the right to object to processing for direct marketing at any time. The Garante noted that procedures for the ""Call me back"" service prevented users from giving free consent and from easily deactivating the service, violating Article 21(2) and (3), which require that the right to object be explicitly brought to the attention of data subjects and presented clearly.

5. The case also involves inadequate security measures for customer management systems, as required by Article 32. The lack of appropriate technical and organisational measures led to unauthorized access and fraudulent activities, failing to ensure the security of processing.

6. Furthermore, Fastweb engaged in processing with partners (e.g., Eni Gas e Luce S.p.A.) without ensuring that valid consent was obtained for shared marketing activities. This implicates Article 26 on joint controllers, requiring transparent arrangements and shared responsibilities, which were not properly implemented.

7. The use of data from abusive call centers that process personal data without respecting GDPR violates Article 5(1)(a), which requires processing to be lawful, fair, and transparent, and Article 44, which governs transfers and processing by third parties without adequate safeguards.

8. The Garante's findings indicate multiple breaches, including failures in accountability under Article 5(2), as Fastweb could not demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, and violations of data subjects' rights under Articles 15-22 due to insufficient mechanisms for consent and objection.

9. Based on the above, the case involves systematic noncompliance with key GDPR provisions, including lawful processing (Article 6), consent (Article 7), security (Article 32), data subject rights (Articles 15-22), and obligations of controllers (Articles 24-25).

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In July 2020, an individual sent an e-mail to the Hellenic DPA reporting that when they attempted to submit an application on the tourism4all.gov.gr platform, they discovered a personal data breach. Indeed, when they entered their credential the application data of a third party (not related to the complainant) which included his full name, Tax Identification Number, Social Security Number (SSN), postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and disability status all appeared.

Additionally, when the individual tried to find the Ministry of Tourism's Data Protection Officer to inform them of this issue, they found it did not have one - in contravention of Article 31(1) and (7) GDPR. Thus, the Hellenic DPA launched an investigation to determine whether the Ministry of Tourism contravened Articles 33, 34 and 37 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 37","1. The Ministry of Tourism is a public authority and thus qualifies as a controller under GDPR, as defined in Article 4(7), which requires compliance with all relevant provisions, including the designation of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) under Article 37(1)(a).

2. The individual reported that the Ministry did not have a Data Protection Officer, which directly contravenes Article 37(1) of GDPR, as processing carried out by a public authority mandates the designation of a DPO.

3. A personal data breach occurred on the tourism4all.gov.gr platform, where sensitive personal data, including full name, Tax Identification Number, Social Security Number, postal address, telephone number, email address, and disability status, was exposed to an unauthorized individual. This data includes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), such as health-related information (disability status), which heightens the risk.

4. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. Given the exposure of sensitive data, the breach likely posed a risk, yet the Ministry failed to notify the Hellenic DPA promptly, as the breach was first reported by the individual, indicating a violation of Article 33.

5. Article 34(1) requires that when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The exposure of sensitive data here constitutes a high risk, but there is no evidence that the Ministry communicated the breach to the affected data subject, thus violating Article 34.

6. Therefore, the Ministry of Tourism contravened Articles 33, 34, and 37 of GDPR, making the case NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Due to COVID-19 pandemic period, the Hellenic Ministry of Education and Religions Affairs (the Ministry) decided to promote and implement a method of distance learning by technological means for students in primary and secondary education. The Greek DPA (HDPA) considered this method legal, but found that the Ministry had failed to consider a number of factors and risks in relation to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects when conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Recognizing the need for the contemporary distance education, the HDPA provided an opinion to the Ministry to address the flaws and shortcomings. The HDPA called on the Ministry to make the appropriate changes to the DPIA within an exclusive period of three months. After that period, the HDPA analyzed once again the measures taken by the Ministry to assess whether the adopted method of distance learning and the measures that accompanied it complied with the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 25, Article 35, Article 37, Article 46","1. The case involves the Hellenic Ministry of Education and Religions Affairs (the Ministry) implementing distance learning during COVID-19, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR, as it involves handling student data through technological means.

2. The Greek DPA (HDPA) found that the Ministry failed to properly conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as required under Article 35(1) for processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, particularly given the large-scale processing of children's data in an educational context.

3. Article 35(7) specifies that a DPIA must include at least a systematic description of processing operations, an assessment of necessity and proportionality, an evaluation of risks to data subjects, and measures envisaged to address those risks. The Ministry's initial DPIA was deficient in considering these factors, violating Article 35(7).

4. Despite being given a three-month period to rectify the deficiencies, the Ministry's revised measures still did not fully comply with the GDPR, as confirmed by the HDPA's subsequent analysis. This indicates a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 25(1) (Data Protection by Design and by Default) to ensure compliance.

5. The Ministry's processing involved educational data of minors, which requires special protection under Article 8 and Recital 38, but the DPIA did not adequately address the risks specific to children, such as unauthorized access or misuse of data in online learning platforms.

6. The continued noncompliance after the rectification period demonstrates a violation of the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the Ministry failed to demonstrate that processing was performed in accordance with the GDPR, including conducting a proper DPIA and consulting the supervisory authority under Article 36(1) where high risks persist.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The HDPA ran an on site audit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as being the data controller according to VIS Regulation and VIS Decision. VIS is an information system for exchanging data among states within Schengen area with an aim to improve common VISA policies. The audit was focused on security issues, which are provided for in Article 32 GDPR and Article 32 of VIS Regulation. Further security requirements are provided for in Article 9 of Council Decision 2008/633/JHA (VIS Decision). Fundamental element of the system is a central database which contains personal data including special categories.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a data controller processing personal data through the Visa Information System (VIS), which includes special categories of personal data (as referenced in the case description mentioning ""personal data including special categories"").

2. The processing of special categories of personal data is governed by Article 9(1) of the GDPR, which generally prohibits such processing unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. The case does not indicate that any of these exceptions (such as explicit consent, necessity for reasons of substantial public interest, or other listed conditions) were properly implemented or documented for this processing operation.

3. The audit focused on security issues under Article 32 of the GDPR and the VIS Regulation. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures such as pseudonymisation, encryption, and ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of processing systems.

4. The verdict of NONCOMPLIANT indicates that the Ministry failed to meet these security obligations. Specifically, the lack of proper security measures (as implied by the audit findings) violates Article 32's requirements, particularly given the sensitive nature of the data involved in the VIS system.

5. Additionally, the case references the VIS Decision (Council Decision 2008/633/JHA), which imposes further security requirements. Failure to comply with these sector-specific rules reinforces the noncompliance with the overarching GDPR principles, including accountability and data protection by design and default (Articles 5(2) and 25).

6. The combination of processing special categories of data without a lawful basis under Article 9 and insufficient security measures under Article 32 constitutes a breach of multiple GDPR provisions, leading to the overall noncompliance verdict.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Vattenfall Europe Sales GmbH offered special contracts that were linked to special bonus payments to its customers. The company routinely reviewed contract enquiries linked to these offers to see whether customers exhibited ""behaviour conspicuous for switching"". Vattenfall used invoices from previous contractual relationships with around 500,000 customers to check this, thus effectively matching this information to the data gathered from the enquiries. The purpose of this was to avoid these deals, which primarily existed to attract new customers, from becoming unprofitable.

Neither first time nor existing customers were adequately informed of this data reconciliation and its ultimate purpose.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 13","1. The case involves Vattenfall Europe Sales GmbH processing personal data of approximately 500,000 customers by matching invoice data from previous contractual relationships with new contract enquiries to identify ""behavior conspicuous for switching"" without adequately informing either first-time or existing customers about this data reconciliation or its purpose (Case facts).

2. Under Article 13(1) of the policy, when personal data is collected directly from data subjects (such as through contract enquiries), the controller must provide specific information including the purposes of processing and legal basis at the time of data collection. Vattenfall failed to provide this information regarding the data matching purpose (Case facts).

3. Under Article 14(1)-(3) of the policy, when personal data have not been obtained directly from the data subject (such as invoice data from previous contracts), the controller must provide specific information to data subjects within a reasonable period, including the categories of personal data concerned, the purposes of processing, and the legal basis. Vattenfall failed to provide this information to customers about the use of their historical invoice data (Case facts).

4. The processing violates Article 5(1)(a) of the policy, which requires personal data to be ""processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner,"" as customers were not informed about the true purpose of data matching and reconciliation, making the processing non-transparent and potentially unfair.

5. The processing likely lacks a valid legal basis under Article 6 of the policy, as the purpose of avoiding unprofitable deals through behavioral analysis of existing customers would not typically qualify as a necessary performance of contract, legitimate interest, or other valid basis without proper disclosure and justification.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to multiple violations of transparency requirements and potentially lawful processing conditions under the GDPR."
"H&M with seat in Hamburg operates a service center in Nuremberg. Since at least 2014, issues concerning the private life of employees have been comprehensively recorded and stored. E.g. after absence due to illness or because of vacation, the respective teamleader conducted a ""Welcome Back Talk"". Detailed information, e.g. information on the symptoms of illness and diagnoses of the employees, has been noted and stored. Moreover,  some supervisors also used information that they heard by accident, for example about family problems and religious beliefs in order to store them on the network drive, which could be accessed by up to 50 managers of the company. This network drive was used to evaluate the performance of the employees and to make employment decisions.

This data collection became public due to a technical configuration error in October 2019. The data stored on the network drive could be seen company-wide for hours.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves H&M processing personal data of its employees, which qualifies H&M as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing.

2. The data processed includes special categories of personal data, such as health information (e.g., symptoms of illness and diagnoses) and religious beliefs, which are explicitly prohibited under Article 9(1) unless a specific exception applies.

3. Processing of special categories of personal data requires a lawful basis under Article 9(2), such as explicit consent or necessity for employment purposes authorized by law. However, in this case, there is no evidence that explicit consent was obtained from employees (Article 9(2)(a)), or that the processing was necessary for employment under Article 9(2)(b) with appropriate safeguards, thus violating Article 9.

4. The principle of lawfulness under Article 6 is violated because no valid lawful basis for processing general personal data is established, especially since the processing of sensitive data without Article 9 compliance inherently breaches Article 6.

5. The principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) is violated, as collecting detailed health and personal information (e.g., from ""Welcome Back Talks"" and accidental eavesdropping) exceeds what is necessary for employment purposes, such as performance evaluation.

6. The principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) is violated because the data was stored on a network drive accessible by up to 50 managers without adequate security, and a technical error exposed it company-wide, indicating a failure to ensure appropriate security measures.

7. Article 32 requires implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security appropriate to the risk. The exposure of sensitive data due to a configuration error demonstrates a lack of such measures, violating Article 32.

8. Transparency obligations under Articles 13 and 14 are likely violated, as employees were not adequately informed about the collection, storage, and use of their sensitive personal data, including the purposes and legal basis for processing.

9. The use of data for employment decisions based on improperly processed information further compounds the violation, as it relies on data obtained without lawful basis and in breach of GDPR principles.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to violations of Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 32, and transparency obligations."
"On 27 December 2019, the UK Cabinet Office (department of the Government of the United Kingdom) published the content page of the New Years 2020 Honours List on its website. The content page contained a link to a CSV file version of the Honours list that was not adequately edited to remove personal data. The CSV file contained the postal address of Honours recipients in a column that had been “hidden” rather than completely “deleted” from the CSV file. Despite the various steps taken before publishing the CSV file, no one within the Cabinet Office teams working on the Honours List noticed that the column was only “hidden”. The column was still there and became apparent again once the CSV file was made available online on gov.uk.

The Cabinet Office was alerted of the data breach by a member of the Government Communications Team. The Cabinet Office then republished the content page without the link to the CSV file. However, anyone who had the exact URL to the CSV file already could still access it despite this change. This is because documents cannot be removed from the gov.uk website once they have been published.

The issue was escalated and eventually the CSV file was permanently deleted around 2 hours and 30 minutes after it was first made available. It was found that the CSV file was accessed 3872 times from 2798 IP addresses.

The Cabinet Office alerted affected data subjects within 48 hours of the data breach and submitted a Personal Data Breach Report to the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.

The Cabinet Office confirmed there was no written process in place to approve documents containing personal data prior to being published to ensure the content was suitably redacted. Additionally, the Cabinet Office’s page for best practice on data handling had not been updated for six months despite the implementation of a new software used to produce the Honours List (which contained a column for addresses). There were various other security concerns identified in an independent review commissioned by the Cabinet Office (accessibility of data to team members that do not need to have access; lack of testing of software to ensure they are robust enough; lack of monitoring of training for staff).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves the UK Cabinet Office, a public authority acting as a data controller, processing personal data (postal addresses of Honours recipients) which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'personal data' and 'controller'.

2. The Cabinet Office failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, they did not ensure the ongoing confidentiality and integrity of processing systems by allowing a CSV file with hidden but not deleted personal data to be published, and they lacked processes for regularly testing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical measures.

3. The Cabinet Office violated the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25. They did not implement appropriate technical measures (such as proper data deletion rather than hiding columns) at the time of determining the means for processing, and they failed to ensure that by default only necessary personal data was processed when publishing the Honours list.

4. The Cabinet Office failed to adhere to the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), as the personal data (postal addresses) was not processed in a manner that ensured appropriate security against unauthorized disclosure.

5. While the Cabinet Office complied with Article 33 by notifying the supervisory authority within 72 hours and with Article 34 by communicating the breach to data subjects within 48 hours, these actions were reactive and do not compensate for the fundamental failures in implementing preventive security measures required by the Regulation.

6. The independent review identified multiple organizational deficiencies including lack of written approval processes for documents containing personal data, outdated best practice guidelines, inadequate access controls, and insufficient staff training - all constituting failures to implement appropriate organisational measures under Articles 24(1) and 32(1).

7. The case demonstrates a failure to take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing when implementing security measures, particularly given the sensitive nature of honours recipients' address information, which required higher safeguards under Article 32(2).

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to multiple violations of the GDPR's security requirements and data protection principles."
"DialADeal Scotland Ltd is an organisation listed as a ""business and domestic software development"" company on the Companies House records.

It used a 'spoofed' number to make a total of 1,376,255 direct marketing calls from August 2019 to March 2020, which led to the ICO receiving 213 complaints. One third of the recipients of these calls were made to users registered with the TPS, a register of numbers allocated to subscribers who have notified the ICO that they do not wish to receive unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes. The calls related to non-existent ""Green Deal"" government energy saving schemes.

In response to an investigation letter sent to the home address of one of the company's two directors, he sent an email stating it did not engage in any of such activities. The ICO was not convinced.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves DialADeal Scotland Ltd processing personal data (specifically, phone numbers) for direct marketing purposes by making unsolicited calls, which falls under the definition of processing in Article 4(2) of the GDPR, as it involves an operation performed on personal data.

2. Under Article 6(1) of the GDPR, processing is lawful only if based on a valid legal basis, such as consent. However, for direct marketing calls to individuals registered with the TPS (Telephone Preference Service), consent is not present, as TPS registration indicates an explicit objection to such calls, violating the requirement for lawful processing.

3. Article 21(2) and (3) of the GDPR grant data subjects the right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes, and upon objection, processing must cease. By making calls to TPS-registered numbers (one-third of all calls), DialADeal ignored these objections, directly violating these provisions.

4. The use of a 'spoofed' number to disguise the caller ID violates the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, which requires processing to be fair and transparent, as it prevents data subjects from identifying the controller and understanding the processing.

5. The content of the calls, which related to non-existent ""Green Deal"" schemes, constitutes unfair processing under Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, as it deceives data subjects and does not serve a legitimate purpose.

6. The scale of processing (1,376,255 calls) and the number of complaints (213) indicate a serious breach of GDPR principles, and the company's denial of activities when investigated demonstrates a failure to comply with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), which requires controllers to demonstrate compliance.

7. Therefore, based on these violations of Articles 5, 6, and 21 of the GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Emailmovers Limited (EML) advertises its services, such as email data, email cleansing, email marketing, etc...). It has a database of data subjects' email addresses. On its website, it claims that it has a ""GDPR and PECR [Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003] compliant email database"". The data was received from an unamed organisation that collected the individual's personal data and mentioned that it may be shared with third parties for marketing purposes.

In 2018, EML was investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). EML provided the ICO enforcement team with 7000 records of personal data (names, dates of birth, postcodes, phone numbers, email addresses).

Emailmovers Limited claimed to be a data processor rather than a controller to the ICO. It claimed so on the basis that it processed data subjects' personal data on behalf of business clients that it had. It also relied on a  document (""Legal and Commercial Terms for  the Supply of Commercial and Personal Data"") where it classified itself as a processor to its business clients.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5","1. The case involves Emailmovers Limited (EML) processing personal data (names, dates of birth, postcodes, phone numbers, email addresses) obtained from an unnamed organization, claiming to be GDPR compliant while classifying itself as a data processor under its ""Legal and Commercial Terms"" document (Article 4 definitions of 'controller', 'processor', and 'processing').

2. EML determines the purposes and means of processing by maintaining its own database, advertising email marketing services, and processing data for marketing purposes, which aligns with the definition of a 'controller' under Article 4(7) rather than a 'processor', as processors act only on instructions from controllers (Article 4(8) and Article 28).

3. For processing to be lawful under Article 6(1), it must meet one of the conditions, such as consent under Article 6(1)(a). The case states that the unnamed organization collected data mentioning it ""may be shared with third parties for marketing purposes,"" which likely does not meet GDPR standards for valid consent under Article 7 and Article 4(11), as consent must be specific, informed, and unambiguous.

4. Under Article 14, where personal data have not been obtained directly from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information to the data subject, including the identity of the controller, the purposes of processing, and the source of the data, within a reasonable period. EML failed to provide this information to data subjects, violating Article 14(1)-(3).

5. EML's claim of being a ""processor"" is contradicted by its role in determining processing purposes (marketing) and maintaining its database, making it a controller under Article 4(7). Controllers cannot avoid their obligations by claiming to be processors, as per Article 28(10), which states that processors acting beyond instructions become controllers.

6. The processing of personal data for marketing purposes without valid consent or another lawful basis violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to EML's incorrect classification as a processor, lack of lawful basis for processing, and failure to meet transparency obligations under Article 14."
"HIV Scotland is a charity that helps people living with HIV, those at risk of HIV and individuals that support people with HIV. HIV Scotland got a MailChimp account for the purpose of online mailing and migrated contact details to the bulk mailing platform. A list of contact details of the Community Advisory Network (CAN) was not migrated.

On 3 Feburary 2020, an email was sent using Microsoft Outlook to 105 members of CAN in CC rather than BCC. This meant that email addresses of 65 recipients were apparent, identifying the individual by name.

HIV Scotland noticed the error instantly and submitted a breach report, highlighting that individuals' HIV statuses could be deduced from this breach. HIV Scotland contacted the individuals to apologise and offered support if distress was caused.

HIV Scotland has since implemented MailChimp for all its mailing operations to reduce the risk of a repeat incident.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves HIV Scotland, a charity processing personal data of individuals related to HIV status, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the policy (GDPR), as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

2. The personal data processed (email addresses), when combined with the context of HIV Scotland's activities, can reveal sensitive information about the data subjects' health status (HIV-related), which falls under special categories of personal data according to Article 9(1).

3. The policy requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorised disclosure of personal data (Article 32(1)).

4. HIV Scotland failed to implement adequate technical measures by using Microsoft Outlook's CC function instead of BCC, resulting in unauthorised disclosure of 65 recipients' email addresses, thereby violating the confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f) (""integrity and confidentiality"").

5. The disclosure constituted a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it involved accidental disclosure of personal data to unauthorised recipients.

6. While HIV Scotland reported the breach and notified data subjects as required under Articles 33 and 34, these actions occurred after the breach and do not remedy the initial failure to implement preventive security measures required by Article 32.

7. The processing of special category data (health-related information) under Article 9 requires higher protection measures under Article 32, which were not sufficiently implemented given the sensitive nature of the data and the risk of inference about HIV status.

8. The subsequent migration to MailChimp acknowledges the insufficiency of previous security measures, confirming the initial noncompliance with Article 32's requirement for appropriate technical measures.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 5(1)(f) (confidentiality principle) and Article 32(1) (security of processing), particularly regarding the processing of special category data under Article 9."
"Mermaids is a registered charity supporting children, young people and their families in relation to gender non-conformity.

In 2016, Mermaids created an internet-based email group service at https://groups.io, overseen by a third party in the USA. This email group was intended to be shared between the CEO of Mermaids and 12 trustees. The default security and privacy settings were left in place, including ""Group listed in directory, publicly viewable messages"".

Mermaids was notified in 2019 by a user of the charity that internal emails, sent using the groups.io email group service, were publicly available online and were searchable through search engines. These contained personal data, including special category data. The service user, who's child is gender non-conforming, was made aware that her child's name, date of birth, mental and physical health were available online, as well as the mother's name, telephone number and address.

Overall, 780 pages of confidential emails were available online. This corresponded to 550 data subjects. 15 data subjects had special category data concerning them made available online (mental or physical health; sex life; sexual orientation) and 9 data subject's personal data was considered sensitive in the context. Of these 24 data subjects, 4 were 13 years old or under.

Mermaids notified the ICO on the day it was told about this.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. Mermaids, as a controller of personal data under Article 4 (definitions of 'controller' and 'processing'), processed personal data through an email group service, including special category data such as mental and physical health, sex life, and sexual orientation, which is prohibited under Article 9(1) unless a condition under Article 9(2) applies. The case does not indicate that explicit consent or any other lawful basis was obtained for making such data publicly available, thus violating Article 9.

2. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. By leaving the default settings on the groups.io service (e.g., ""Group listed in directory, publicly viewable messages""), Mermaids failed to implement appropriate security measures, leading to unauthorized access and disclosure of personal data.

3. Article 32(1) mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Given the sensitivity of the special category data involved and the context of a charity supporting vulnerable individuals, the risk was high, but Mermaids did not change the default settings or apply additional safeguards, violating Article 32.

4. Article 25(2) on data protection by default requires that by default, personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention. The setting that made messages ""publicly viewable"" means that data was accessible without intervention, which directly contravenes Article 25.

5. The breach resulted in the disclosure of personal data of 550 data subjects, including 24 with sensitive data (15 with special category data and 9 with contextually sensitive data), and 4 children aged 13 or under. For children's data, Article 8 requires additional protections, such as verifying parental consent for information society services, but even though the email group may not directly qualify, the exposure of children's data underscores the failure to provide enhanced safeguards.

6. While Mermaids notified the ICO promptly upon discovering the breach, as required by Article 33(1), the breach itself occurred due to prior failures to comply with security and data protection principles, indicating systemic non-compliance.

7. Therefore, due to violations of Article 5(1)(f), Article 9, Article 25(2), and Article 32(1), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Parkin Beacher Ltd is a direct marketing company that operates under the trading name ""Your Pension Options"" and ""Pension Choice"".

Between February and September 2019, the ICO received a number of complaints from individuals who were called by the same phone number. The callers asked about them about their pensions using their first name. The company had obtained the data necessary for these calls from a third-party data supplier, who in turn obtained it from various sites. Users had agreed to these sites' Privacy Policies' which specified their information would be passed on for marketing purposes, but were not given the opportunity to select which organisations to receive marketing material from.

In the time frame assessed by the ICO, Parkin Beacher Ltd made 96,817 phone calls using this data.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves Parkin Beacher Ltd processing personal data (names and phone numbers) for direct marketing purposes through unsolicited phone calls, which falls under the scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of processing and personal data).

2. The data was obtained from a third-party supplier who collected it from various websites where users had agreed to Privacy Policies allowing marketing purposes. However, under Article 6 (lawfulness of processing), consent must be specific and informed. Article 7 (conditions for consent) requires that consent be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The users were not given the opportunity to select which organizations would receive their data, making the consent insufficient under Article 7(2) and not ""specific"" as required.

3. When personal data is not obtained directly from the data subject, Article 14 (information to be provided where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject) requires the controller to provide specific information to the data subject, including the identity of the controller, the purposes of processing, the categories of personal data, and the source of the data. Parkin Beacher Ltd did not provide this information to the individuals before or at the time of processing, violating Article 14(1)-(3).

4. Article 21 (right to object) gives data subjects the right to object to processing for direct marketing at any time. The complaints received by the ICO indicate that individuals were not informed of this right prior to or during the calls, as required by Article 21(4), which mandates that the right to object be explicitly brought to the data subject's attention at the latest at the time of the first communication.

5. The processing for direct marketing purposes based on consent obtained through third-party websites does not meet the standard of ""freely given"" consent under Article 7(4), as the performance of a service (access to websites) was conditional on consent to marketing without allowing users to choose specific organizations, which is disproportionate.

6. Under Article 5 (principles relating to processing), personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. The lack of specific consent, failure to provide required information, and absence of a clear mechanism to object render the processing unfair and non-transparent, violating Article 5(1)(a).

7. The volume of calls (96,817) indicates large-scale processing, which requires higher accountability under Article 24 (responsibility of the controller). Parkin Beacher Ltd failed to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, as it did not ensure valid consent or provide necessary information, thus breaching the accountability principle.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations, including invalid consent (Articles 6 and 7), failure to provide information (Article 14), lack of transparency (Article 5), and infringement of the right to object (Article 21)."
"Royal Mail is the British postal service and is the data controller. On 29 April 2021, Royal Mail submitted a written breach report to the UK DPA (ICO) that due to a technical error, its marketing actions might have sent emails to “215,202 parties who had expressed a desire to no longer receive marketing from [Royal Mail]”.

Royal Mail explained that it had a list of 245,850 potential recipients, out of which “30,648 had provided valid and existing consent to receive the direct marketing messages, with 215,202 being deemed to have opted out.” On 20 April 2021, at the time of transmission of the marketing email, Royal Mail had sent the email to 30,648 persons while putting 215,202 in a holding step of the campaign.  However, on 27 April 2021, “due to an internal routing error, the 215,202 individuals who had been moved to the “holding step” were accidentally sent a “reminder email” which had been intended only for the 30,648 individuals who had been sent, but had not opened or engaged with, the initial email on 20 April 2021.”

The ICO opened an investigation and sought details about the volume of messages and an explanation of the routing error. Before the ICO, Royal Mail submitted the following:

It uses an automated system called Eloqua to send marketing emails. Royal Mail maintains a single master database of all individuals, i.e. those who have provided their consent to receive marketing emails and also those who have not consented to receive marketing emails. The single database is maintained to keep it updated as per the latest status of consent.

In a campaign, marketing emails are sent by Eloqua to those who have provided their consent. Individuals who have not given their consent are put at the end of the campaign, and the stage of sending them emails is bypassed. A reminder email is sent to persons who have given their consent but have not interacted with the original email.

In the present instance, 215,202 customers who were sent the reminder marketing email fell into two groups, “One group was made up of 91,736 customers who were registered with Royal Mail. This group had previously been presented with Royal Mail’s Fair Processing Notice at the point of registering, and subsequently opted out of marketing emails. The second group comprising the remaining 123,466 individuals were customers who had not registered for a Royal Mail account and had, at the time of using a Royal Mail service, checked out as a ‘guest’. These individuals were not asked about their marketing preferences and had not provided consent to receive future direct marketing.”

At the stage of sending reminder emails, details of persons who had not given their consent were fed to Eloqua due to a human error. Accordingly, persons who had not given their consent received the reminder email, even as they were not sent the original email. However, of “the 215,202 messages sent, the number delivered was “no more than 213,191”.”

Since the incident, Royal Mail has introduced several checks to minimize the risk of potential recurrence.

Royal Mail received six responses/complaints from subscribers who had received the unsolicited marketing email, in reply to which it apologized.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves Royal Mail as the data controller processing personal data for direct marketing purposes, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 4 (definitions of 'controller' and 'processing') and Article 6 (lawfulness of processing).

2. Royal Mail sent marketing emails to 215,202 individuals who had not provided consent: 91,736 had explicitly opted out, and 123,466 had never been asked for consent (guest checkout users). This processing lacks a lawful basis under Article 6(1), which requires consent or another valid condition for processing personal data. Specifically, for direct marketing, consent is typically required under Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7 (conditions for consent).

3. The routing error resulted in processing that violated the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as individuals who had objected to marketing or never consented received unsolicited communications.

4. The incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it involved unauthorized disclosure of personal data (email addresses) for marketing purposes without a legal basis. Royal Mail failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent such a breach, as required by Article 5(2) (accountability principle) and Article 32 (security of processing).

5. Royal Mail did not respect the right to object to direct marketing under Article 21(2) and (3), which requires that personal data no longer be processed for such purposes upon objection. The 91,736 registered users who had opted out had exercised this right, yet their preferences were not honored due to the error.

6. For the 123,466 guest users, Royal Mail failed to provide information about marketing practices and obtain consent at the time of data collection, as required by Article 13 (information to be provided where data is collected from the data subject) and Article 7 (consent conditions). This lack of transparency and lawful consent further violates Articles 5 and 6.

7. Although Royal Mail introduced post-breach checks, the incident itself demonstrates noncompliance with the GDPR's proactive requirements for data protection by design and by default under Article 25, as the system design allowed a single human error to cause a large-scale breach.

8. The breach notification to the ICO was made, which aligns with Article 33 (notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority). However, the breach itself and the underlying processing violations remain noncompliant.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to unlawful processing, failure to respect objections, lack of appropriate safeguards, and violations of principles under Article 5."
"The ICO received a number of complaints regarding unsolicited email marketing. These were sent on behalf of Saga Personal Finance Limited (hereafter 'SPF') by different partner companies, so it launched an investigation into SPF's data practices.

The company is a subsidiary of Saga Group Limited, which received a similar fine on the same day for another subsidiary's direct marketing practices.

First, it sent a letter to the Saga Group requesting information ""including details of Saga Group's Partners/Affiliates, websites from which consent for marketing was obtained together with evidence of that consent, and a description of any due diligence carried out with respect to the data used by Saga Group"". The company replied, informing the ICO that the marketing content was indeed sent out by partners on behalf of SPF ""using a database of individuals who had opted in to receiving marketing materials from third parties either via the Partners' websites or via websites operated by their sub-contractors"". No personal data was actually transferred from the company, but it exercised total control over the content to comply with FCA requirements. The targeting and recipients was nonetheless controlled by its partners.

Then, the ICO reviewed whether the consent on which the email marketing was based was legitimately obtained. It found that SPF was not named on any of the privacy policies the users of different websites agreed to. Some consent statements did not even inform the individuals agreeing to them that they would receive any third party marketing.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves Saga Personal Finance Limited (SPF) processing personal data for direct marketing purposes through partner companies, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as established in Article 1 (subject-matter and objectives) and Article 2 (material scope).

2. The processing of personal data for marketing purposes requires a lawful basis under Article 6. SPF relied on consent obtained by partner companies through their websites, which would fall under Article 6(1)(a) (""the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes"").

3. For consent to be valid under the GDPR, it must meet the conditions specified in Article 7. Specifically, Article 7(1) requires that ""the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data,"" and Article 7(2) states that consent must be given through a clear affirmative act.

4. Additionally, Article 13 requires that when personal data are collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information including ""the identity and the contact details of the controller"" and ""the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.""

5. The investigation revealed that SPF was not named in the privacy policies of the partner websites where consent was obtained. Some consent statements did not even inform individuals that they would receive third-party marketing. This violates Article 13(1)(a) and (c), as data subjects were not properly informed about who would process their data and for what purposes.

6. Since SPF was not identified as a controller in the consent process, the consent cannot be considered specific to SPF's processing activities as required by Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7. The consent obtained was therefore invalid for SPF's marketing purposes.

7. Article 5(1)(a) requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Processing based on invalid consent fails to meet this requirement.

8. Furthermore, SPF as the controller (determining the purposes and means of processing as defined in Article 4) bears responsibility for ensuring valid legal basis for processing under the principle of accountability in Article 5(2), even when partners are involved in obtaining consent.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to invalid consent obtained without proper transparency information and controller identification, violating Articles 5, 6, 7, and 13."
"The ICO received a number of complaints regarding unsolicited email marketing. These were sent on behalf of Saga Services Limited (hereafter 'SSL') by different partner companies, so it launched an investigation into SSL's data practices.

The company is a subsidiary of Saga Group Limited, which received a similar fine on the same day for another subsidiary's direct marketing practices.

First, it sent a letter to the Saga Group requesting information ""including details of Saga Group's Partners/Affiliates, websites from which consent for marketing was obtained together with evidence of that consent, and a description of any due diligence carried out with respect to the data used by Saga Group"". The company replied, informing the ICO that the marketing content was indeed sent out by partners on behalf of SSL ""using a database of individuals who had opted in to receiving marketing materials from third parties either via the Partners' websites or via websites operated by their sub-contractors"". No personal data was actually transferred from the company, but it exercised total control over the content to comply with FCA requirements. The targeting and recipients was nonetheless controlled by its partners.

Then, the ICO reviewed whether the consent on which the email marketing was based was legitimately obtained. It found that SSL was not named on any of the privacy policies the users of different websites agreed to. Some consent statements did not even inform the individuals agreeing to them that they would receive any third party marketing.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves Saga Services Limited (SSL) engaging in direct marketing through partners, which constitutes processing of personal data under the policy's definition (Article 4), as email marketing involves using personal data (email addresses) for communication purposes.

2. The policy requires that processing of personal data must have a lawful basis under Article 6(1). For marketing communications, consent is typically required under Article 6(1)(a) and further governed by the conditions for consent in Articles 4(11), 6, and 7.

3. Article 7(1) requires that controllers be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing, and Article 7(2) specifies that if consent is given in a written declaration, the request must be clearly distinguishable and in intelligible, accessible language.

4. The investigation revealed that SSL was not named in the privacy policies or consent statements on partner websites, violating Article 13(1)(a) and (c), which require that data subjects be informed of the controller's identity and the purposes of processing at the time data is collected.

5. Some consent statements did not inform individuals they would receive third-party marketing, violating Article 13(1)(e), which requires disclosure of recipients or categories of recipients of personal data.

6. Since SSL was acting as a joint controller with its partners (as it exercised control over content and targeting), Article 26(1) applies, requiring transparent arrangement of responsibilities. SSL failed to ensure partners obtained valid consent specifically naming SSL as a controller.

7. The policy's transparency principles (Articles 5(1)(a), 12, and 13) require that processing be fair and transparent, and that data subjects be provided with clear information about who processes their data and for what purposes. The lack of disclosure regarding SSL's role and the marketing purposes violates these provisions.

8. Therefore, the consent obtained was not specific, informed, or unambiguous as required by Article 4(11) and Article 7, rendering the processing unlawful under Article 6(1).

9. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to invalid consent, lack of transparency, and failure to meet the requirements for lawful processing of personal data."
"The UK DPA, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), examined the monthly reports received from the Telephone Preference Service Ltd (TPS), which described complaints about Solarwave Limited’s unsolicited marketing calls. Between 2 January 2020 and 2 October 2020, Solarwave Limited made 73,217 unsolicited direct marketing calls, and 30 complaints were submitted in relation to those calls. The calls were made to subscribers who had registered with the TPS and who had not given their prior consent to receive calls.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves Solarwave Limited processing personal data (specifically, phone numbers) for direct marketing purposes by making unsolicited calls, which falls under the definition of ""processing"" in Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. The individuals who received calls had registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), indicating that they had not given prior consent to receive marketing calls and had effectively exercised their right to object to such processing, as provided under Article 21(2) of the GDPR.

3. Article 6(1) of the GDPR requires that processing of personal data be lawful, and for direct marketing, consent under Article 6(1)(a) is a key lawful basis. However, in this case, Solarwave did not obtain consent from the data subjects, making the processing unlawful.

4. Furthermore, Article 21(3) of the GDPR states that when a data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data must no longer be processed for such purposes. Since TPS registration constitutes an objection, Solarwave was obligated to cease processing but failed to do so.

5. By making 73,217 unsolicited marketing calls without consent and despite the objection implied by TPS registration, Solarwave violated Article 6(1) (lawfulness of processing) and Article 21(3) (right to object) of the GDPR.

6. Additionally, Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Solarwave's actions were unlawful and unfair, as they disregarded the data subjects' preferences and rights.

7. The 30 complaints submitted to TPS demonstrate that data subjects were harmed and their rights under the GDPR were infringed, highlighting the noncompliance.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Tempcover Ltd is a company that provides short term motor insurance and is the data controller. Mobile UK is an entity representing the interests of mobile subscribers in the UK. Mobile UK has a Spam Reporting Service, and subscribers can report a spam message by forwarding the spam message to Mobile UK. Mobile UK compiles the spam reports on a monthly basis and provides a report to the ICO.

In May 2020, upon analysing the monthly reports provided by Mobile UK, the ICO ascertained “that between 1 November 2019 and 18 May 2020 there were a total of 13 complaints received from which Tempcover could be identified; of these, 12 were made via the 7726 service, and 1 was made directly to the Commissioner.” Accordingly, the ICO initiated an investigation against Tempcover.

Before the ICO, Tempcover submitted the following:

1. It sent direct marketing text messages and subscribers could see that they were sent by Tempcover.

2. A total of 1905,776 direct marketing text messages were sent between 26 May 2019 and 26 May 2020. However, it had the data only from 26 November 2019 to 26 May 2020 as per its data retention policy.

3. It had obtained the data of subscribers directly from them when they had sought to obtain a quotation from Tempcover’s website. It claimed that the subscribers got a clear link to its privacy policy and terms and conditions which state: “By submitting your information to the Tempcover Site (“Our Site”) you are consenting to the processing of your information by us and our agents in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By obtaining a quote from us, you consent to Tempcover contacting you, by email and/or SMS, with details of our new products, services and promotions. You can opt out from this at any time by contacting us on contactus@tempcover.com or following the ‘unsubscribe/opt-out’ link in your email or SMS.”

4. Before the data provided by subscribers could get captured, they had to click on “'AGREE AND CONTINUE” to show their acceptance to privacy policy and terms and conditions.

5. It operates an internal suspension list, which is updated in real-time.

6. It provides Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (PECR) training to its staff. Before starting with the SMS campaign, it had conducted a Legitimate Interest Assessment, which had been reviewed by its Data Protection Officer (DPO) and the Marketing Department.

7. Between 26 May 2019 and 26 May 2020, it also sent “29,156,023 emails, and that, of those, 28,822,172 were successfully delivered to a recipient.”

Upon further enquiry, Tempcover submitted that subsequently it had undertaken a host of measures, “amongst which would be a separate button allowing individuals to select their marketing preferences at the point of consent being obtained.”",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves Tempcover Ltd as a data controller processing personal data for direct marketing purposes via SMS, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as it involves automated processing of personal data (Article 2).

2. Tempcover claimed consent as the legal basis for processing personal data for marketing communications under Article 6(1)(a), which requires that consent be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"" (Article 4(11)).

3. The consent mechanism described required users to click ""AGREE AND CONTINUE"" to accept both the privacy policy and terms and conditions, which bundled consent for marketing with the acceptance of general terms. This violates the requirement that consent must be ""specific"" to distinct processing purposes and not conditioned upon acceptance of unrelated terms (Article 7(4)).

4. The privacy policy language stated that by obtaining a quote, users consent to marketing communications, implying consent was obtained through a pre-ticked action (obtaining a quote) rather than through a clear affirmative act separate from other actions. This fails to meet the standard for unambiguous consent under Article 4(11) and Article 7(1).

5. The controller failed to demonstrate valid consent as required by Article 7(1), as the consent was not granular (it covered multiple purposes in a single action) and was not freely given due to the bundling with non-negotiable terms for obtaining a quote.

6. The processing of personal data for direct marketing via SMS without valid consent constitutes a violation of Article 6(1), as no other lawful basis was established for this processing.

7. The number of complaints received (13) and the scale of messaging (over 1.9 million texts) indicate a systemic failure to comply with consent requirements, exacerbated by the fact that Tempcover only retained data for 6 months despite processing occurring over a longer period, hindering accountability (Article 5(2)).

8. While Tempcover implemented some measures like an internal suspension list and staff training, these did not rectify the fundamental issue of invalid initial consent collection, and the subsequent proposal to add a separate marketing preference button acknowledges the original non-compliance.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to invalid consent mechanisms violating Articles 4(11), 6(1), and 7(1)."
"The controller is the UK Ministry of Justice ('MoJ'), and processes personal data in the course of carrying out its functions.

In December 2017, the MoJ had already been issued with an Enforcement Notice following a finding by the ICO that it had failed to comply with a large number of subject access requests without undue delay. Then, in January 2019 the ICO ""was made aware by the controller that a backlog of subject access requests had again accrued."" The DPA therefore launched a new investigation into the matter.

After a series of exchanges with the MoJ, the ICO uncovered that there were 7,753 overdue access requests.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The case involves the UK Ministry of Justice (MoJ) as a controller processing personal data in the course of its functions, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR policy as defined in Article 2, and the MoJ is considered a controller under Article 4(7).

2. The MoJ is subject to the obligations under GDPR, including the right of access by data subjects under Article 15, which requires controllers to provide confirmation and access to personal data upon request.

3. Article 12(3) of the GDPR policy stipulates that the controller must provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15-22 without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.

4. The case reveals that the MoJ had a backlog of 7,753 overdue subject access requests, indicating that it failed to respond to these requests within the one-month period required by Article 12(3), thus violating this provision.

5. Furthermore, Article 12(4) requires that if the controller does not take action on a request, it must inform the data subject without delay and within one month of the reasons for not taking action, which likely was not fulfilled given the scale of the backlog.

6. This non-compliance is exacerbated by the fact that the MoJ had previously been issued an Enforcement Notice in December 2017 for similar failures to comply with subject access requests without undue delay, indicating a recurrent violation of GDPR obligations.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."
"The Money Hive Limited (TMHL) is a company that calls itself ""a short term loan lender and broker for other lenders and financial service providers"". Mobile UK is an entity representing the interests of mobile subscribers in the UK. Mobile UK has a Spam Reporting Service, and subscribers can report a spam message by forwarding the spam message to Mobile UK.

In September 2020, numerous unsolicited text messages by Money Hive were reported. The Investigating Officer ascertained nine separate message scripts promoting high-interest payday loans. The messages contained links to websites operated by TMHL and were sent to people who had “previously applied online for a loan with a TMHL-operated website” but had left the process midway to due to any reason.

In response to the ICO’s letter seeking information and documentation about consent provided by the subscribers, TMHL stated the following:

•	It had used the services of two platform providers to send the messages.

•	Between 1 January 2020 to 8 September 2020, a total of 752,425 text messages were received by subscribers.

•	TMHL divided consent into two categories: “a) Individuals consent to being notified of their loan application results via SMS; and b) individuals consent to future marketing from it and ""select 3rd parties"" via separate tick boxes.” It added that ""a very small number of customers might not realise that the messages are direct responses to their loan application and consider them to be marketing texts"".

The ICO considered the 'customer journey' documents provided by TMHL and noticed two opt-in statements. Opt-in 1 was accessible after a customer had clicked 'apply now' on the respective website and had entered their contact details. It had the following text, followed by three separate optional tick boxes for email/SMS/phone:

""LoanPig and our 3rd party partners would like to stay in touch with you via email and sms to send you reminders and occasional relevant offers, please tick below if you wish to receive this[. .. ]""

Opt-in 2 had three checkboxes in which the first two checkboxes relating to subscribers being “contacted by SMS, email or telephone by Loanpig (TMHL) and its ""third party partners""” and their agreement to Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy were mandatory.

TMHL’s Privacy Policy stated that if a customer’s application “""does not meet [TMHL's] underwriting criteria, we may pass your details to a broker who may be able to offer you a loan or financial service from their panel of lenders and financial service providers""”. It also provided a list of brokers and further stated, “""[a]s part of the application process some lenders and financial service partners may take up to 24 hrs to respond by sms, email, or phone, so you may receive product offers from them within that period [... ]. To provide the best service possible during your application, we may send you, by sms or email, relevant alternative or complimentary products within the 24h application period"".”

The ICO noticed that many of the brokers listed in TMHL’s Privacy Policy were in the business of lead generation services/affiliate network services.

Before the ICO, TMHL gave evidence of subscribers having opted out of its messaging texts. It also explained the working of its messaging system and the number of messages being sent. On the aspect of messages containing links to third parties, TMHL stated that “they use alternative brokers to obtain a loan for their customers stating: ""[t]his isn't promoting 3rd party websites and we are only paid a commission when the customer gets a loan, not for each lead sent for example so we consider this the same as sending a customer to an alternative lender's website where they may obtain a loan. To confirm, we do not receive any commission if the consumer does not apply online or find a product, so this is not marketing"".” In addition, TMHL submitted to the ICO a “'Legitimate Interest Assessment' document in relation to these messages, which explained that their purpose was to provide an alternative short-term loan [through an alternative broker] when the individual's application to TMHL directly was unsuccessful.”

TMHL informed the ICO that they had started sending these messages from 12 March 2020. TMHL stated that it conducted regular due diligence, but it was on a face to face basis and there was no documentary record of the same.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4,"1. The case involves The Money Hive Limited (TMHL) processing personal data (specifically, phone numbers) by sending text messages to individuals who had previously applied for loans but did not complete the process. This processing falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, which applies to the automated processing of personal data.

2. TMHL claimed that consent was obtained through opt-in statements on their website. However, under Article 7 of the GDPR, consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. In Opt-in 2, the checkboxes for being contacted by TMHL and third parties were mandatory for proceeding with the loan application, which violates Article 7(4) because making consent to marketing a condition for a service (the loan application) when such processing is not necessary for the performance of the contract means consent is not freely given.

3. The wording in Opt-in 1 referred to ""reminders and occasional relevant offers,"" which is vague and does not clearly specify that it includes marketing communications from TMHL or third parties. This lack of clarity means consent is not informed or specific, as required by Article 7(1) and (2), which state that consent must be clear and distinguishable from other matters.

4. TMHL relied on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) for sending messages to offer alternative loans. However, for direct marketing purposes, Article 21 provides an absolute right to object, and legitimate interest cannot override this right without valid consent. The ICO determined that the messages were for direct marketing, and thus consent should have been obtained, making the legitimate interest claim invalid.

5. Article 13 requires that data subjects be provided with information about the purposes of processing and the recipients of personal data at the time of data collection. TMHL's Privacy Policy mentioned passing data to brokers, but it was not clearly communicated at the point of consent, and the list of brokers (involved in lead generation) was not sufficiently detailed, violating Article 13(1)(e) and (f).

6. TMHL shared personal data with third-party brokers without explicit consent for such sharing, as the consent obtained was not specific to each third party or category, contrary to Article 13(1)(e). This sharing for marketing purposes without proper consent also violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

7. The processing of personal data resulted in 752,425 unsolicited text messages being sent, many of which were reported as spam, indicating a lack of valid consent and a breach of the principles of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

8. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 5, 6, 7, 13, and 21 of the GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Tuckers Solicitors (Tuckers) is a limited liability partnership of solicitors and is the data controller. On 24 August 2020, Tuckers became aware that its systems were hit by a ransomware attack. On 25 August 2020, Tuckers determined that the hit had resulted in a personal data breach. It notified the same to the UK DPA (ICO) on the same day and stated, “attack had resulted in the encryption of civil and criminal legal case bundles stored on an archive server. Backups were also encrypted by the attacker”. In total, “972,191 individual files were encrypted. Of these, 24,711 related to court bundles. Of the 24,711 court bundles, 60 were exfiltrated by the attacker” and published on the dark web. As per Tuckers, “the bundles included a comprehensive set of personal data, including medical files, witness statements, name and addresses of witnesses and victims, and the alleged crimes of the individuals.”

Tuckers notified 53 parties (out of the 60) whose bundles were released, as per Article 34 GDPR.

On 27 August 2020, Tuckers appointed a third-party investigator to provide a 'Cyber Security Incident Response Report'. The investigators could not find the source of the attack but found “evidence of a known system vulnerability” that could have been used to access Tucker’s networks and exploit them. Subsequently, the investigators released a patch, which Tucker incorporated in its systems in June 2020.

In September 2020, Tuckers informed the ICO that it had “moved its servers to a new environment and the business was now back to running as normal, albeit without the restoration of the data that had been compromised by the attacker.”",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves Tuckers Solicitors as a data controller processing personal data, including special categories of data (medical files, witness statements, etc.), which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of personal data and processing).

2. Tuckers experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in the encryption and exfiltration of personal data, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) GDPR.

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to protect against unauthorised access or disclosure. The investigation revealed evidence of a known system vulnerability that could have been exploited, indicating that Tuckers failed to implement timely security patches, thereby violating Article 32(1).

4. Article 33(1) mandates that controllers notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. Tuckers notified the ICO on 25 August 2020, which appears compliant; however, the breach itself resulted from prior security failures.

5. Article 34(1) requires controllers to communicate a personal data breach to affected data subjects without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. Tuckers notified only 53 out of 60 affected parties, failing to notify all affected data subjects, which violates Article 34(1).

6. Article 5(1)(f) stipulates that personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised processing. The breach and exfiltration of sensitive data demonstrate a failure to ensure such security, violating the integrity and confidentiality principle.

7. Article 9(1) prohibits processing special categories of data (e.g., medical files, data revealing alleged crimes) unless an exception applies. While Tuckers may have had a lawful basis for processing (e.g., legal claims under Article 9(2)(f)), the breach itself constitutes a failure to protect such data adequately, undermining the safeguards required under Article 9.

8. The investigation found that Tuckers only patched the known vulnerability after the breach (in June 2020, though the breach occurred in August 2020, suggesting a possible timeline discrepancy; however, the key point is that the vulnerability existed and was not addressed proactively), indicating a lack of ongoing risk assessment and timely implementation of security measures, contrary to Article 32(1) and (d).

9. The scale of the breach (972,191 files encrypted, including 24,711 court bundles) and the sensitivity of the data (e.g., witness details, medical records) highlight the severity of the security failures, further emphasising noncompliance with Articles 5, 32, and 34.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to failures in implementing appropriate security measures, notifying all affected data subjects, and protecting personal data in accordance with the principles and specific obligations under Articles 5, 32, 33, and 34."
"An ICO investigation found the airline was processing a significant amount of personal data without adequate security measures in place. This failure broke data protection law and, subsequently, British Airways (BA) was the subject of a cyber-attack during 2018, which it did not detect for more than two months.

ICO investigators found BA ought to have identified weaknesses in its security and resolved them with security measures that were available at the time. The attacker is believed to have potentially accessed the personal data of approximately 429,612 customers and staff. This included names, addresses, payment card numbers and CVV numbers of 244,000 BA customers. Other details thought to have been accessed include the combined card and CVV numbers of 77,000 customers and card numbers only for 108,000 customers.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves British Airways (BA) as a controller processing personal data of customers and staff, which falls under the definitions of 'controller' and 'processing' in Article 4 of the GDPR policy.
2. BA processed sensitive personal data, including names, addresses, payment card numbers, and CVV numbers, which requires heightened protection under GDPR.
3. Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR requires that personal data be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.""
4. Article 32(1) of the GDPR further specifies that controllers must ""implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,"" taking into account factors such as the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.
5. The ICO investigation found that BA was processing a significant amount of personal data without adequate security measures in place, meaning BA failed to implement the required measures under Article 32(1) and violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality in Article 5(1)(f).
6. This failure led to a cyber-attack in 2018 that resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of approximately 429,612 individuals, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12).
7. BA's inability to detect the breach for over two months indicates a lack of appropriate security measures, such as those required under Article 32(1)(b) (ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems) and Article 32(1)(d) (process for regularly testing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical measures).
8. The breach involved access to payment card data and CVV numbers, which are particularly sensitive and should have been protected with robust encryption or pseudonymization measures as per Article 32(1)(a), but BA failed to do so.
9. Therefore, based on the violations of Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The ICO autonomously started an investigation into the three major Credit Reference Agencies ('CRAs') in 2018 under the Data Protection Act 1998. The investigation was paused and then resumed after the new GDPR entered into force in order to ensure the violations were addressed under the modern data protection regime, rather than a historical legal position, given the importance and relevance of such processing activities.

The processing in question is on a very large scale (roughly 50 million people resident in the UK, with more than 500 attributes for each person).

Experian acquired this information from a variety of sources and it also include credit reference data, which could lead to unexpected and 'invisible' processing activities. Experian uses them to propose a variety of marketing-led products (eg. Mosaic and Channelview), which are sold to third parties to enable them more targeted and effective direct marketing to data subjects.

Having found several violations of the new Regulation, the Commissioner issued a Preliminary Enforcement notice on 17 April 2019 to Experian. Afterwards, Experian collaborated with the Authority and provided further details and documents in order to make the improvements requested. On 20 April 2020, a revised Enforcement Notice was proposed.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 14","1. The case involves Experian, a controller processing personal data on a large scale (approximately 50 million UK residents with over 500 attributes each), which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. Experian acquired personal data from various sources, including credit reference data, and used this information for marketing purposes (e.g., Mosaic and Channelview products) sold to third parties for targeted direct marketing. This processing requires compliance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

3. The investigation found that Experian failed to provide adequate transparency information to data subjects as required under Articles 13 and 14. Specifically, when personal data were not obtained directly from the data subject, Experian did not inform individuals about the processing purposes, legal basis, categories of data, or their rights, violating Article 14(1)-(3).

4. Experian did not establish a valid lawful basis for processing personal data for marketing purposes under Article 6. The processing relied on legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)), but Experian failed to conduct a proper balancing test to ensure that its interests were not overridden by data subjects' rights and freedoms, especially given the intrusive nature of the processing.

5. The processing involved credit reference data, which relates to financial circumstances and may involve special categories of data or data concerning criminal convictions under Articles 9 and 10. However, Experian did not apply appropriate safeguards or obtain explicit consent, as required for such sensitive processing.

6. Experian did not facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15-22, as mandated by Article 12. Data subjects were not adequately informed of their right to object to processing for direct marketing under Article 21(2), and the controller did not provide mechanisms to easily exercise this right.

7. The scale and nature of the processing (large-scale profiling and automated decision-making) required a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35, but Experian failed to conduct one, thereby not identifying or mitigating risks to data subjects' rights.

8. The controller did not implement data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, as the processing systems were designed without sufficient privacy safeguards, leading to unnecessary data collection and use.

9. Based on the violations of Articles 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 21, 25, and 35, the supervisory authority (ICO) found Experian noncompliant and issued an Enforcement Notice to rectify these breaches.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc’s (“Starwood”) IT system were first compromised by unknown attackers in 2014. Marriot subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but did not detect this attack at any time between that moment and September 2018. Therefore, between 2014 and 2018, the attackers  had access to Starwood’s systems through use of Remote Access Trojan malware, and kept extracting Starwood databases. Marriott became aware of potential attacks following an alert from a system applied to one of its most confidential databases on September 2018. After that Marriot found malware installed and proof that databases had been extracted over the years, so they promptly notified both the ICO and relevant data subjects of the breach. The ICO found that the attackers had obtained unencrypted personal data of the likes of: passport numbers, identifying information of the costumers such as name, date of birth and gender, plus credit card details in encrypted form.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves Marriott International processing personal data of customers, including sensitive information such as passport numbers and credit card details, which falls under the scope of GDPR as defined in Article 3 (territorial scope) and Article 4 (definitions of personal data and processing).

2. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The breach lasting from 2014 to 2018, where attackers extracted databases via malware, demonstrates a failure to implement such security measures.

3. Article 32 mandates that controllers and processors implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The prolonged undetected breach (2014-2018) indicates insufficient security measures, such as failure to detect Remote Access Trojan malware or protect unencrypted passport data, violating this requirement.

4. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. Marriott became aware in September 2018 and notified promptly, which complies with this article upon discovery, but the prior lack of awareness highlights a failure in ongoing monitoring.

5. Article 34(1) requires communication of a personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms. Marriott communicated the breach after discovery, which is compliant in timing but does not mitigate the prior security failures.

6. The failure to detect the breach from 2014 until 2018, despite the acquisition in 2016, violates the principle of accountability under Article 5(2), as Marriott did not demonstrate compliance with security obligations during this period.

7. The processing of special categories of data (e.g., passport numbers) without adequate safeguards violates Article 9, which prohibits processing such data unless appropriate conditions are met, and emphasizes the need for higher protection, which was not maintained.

8. Therefore, due to the violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 32, and the principle of accountability under Article 5(2), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."

The case involves Ticketmaster as a controller processing personal data of its customers for online ticket sales, which falls under the scope of GDPR as defined in Article 4(7) and Article 2(1).

2. Ticketmaster failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), which led to a personal data breach through its chat-bot system on the payment page.

3. The company received multiple reports of fraudulent transactions from financial institutions starting in February 2018 but took nine weeks to identify the problem and monitor network traffic, violating Article 33(1) which requires controllers to notify supervisory authorities of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it.

4. The breach affected 9.4 million EEA data subjects, including 1.5 million in the UK, and resulted in approximately 997 complaints alleging financial loss and/or emotional distress, indicating a failure to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects as per Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle).

5. Ticketmaster's delay in identifying and addressing the breach contravenes the accountability principle in Article 5(2), which requires controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles.

6. The company's failure to implement adequate security measures and promptly address the breach also violates Article 24(1), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with GDPR.

"The airline’s failure to secure its systems resulted in the unauthorised access to their passengers’ personal details including: names, passport and identity details, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, phone numbers and historical travel information. Cathay Pacific became aware of suspicious activity in March 2018 when its database was subjected to a brute force attack, where numerous passwords or phrases are submitted with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The incident led Cathay Pacific to employ a cybersecurity firm, and they subsequently reported the incident to the ICO. The ICO found Cathay Pacific’s systems were entered via a server connected to the internet and malware was installed to harvest data. Several errors were found during the ICO’s investigation including: back-up files that were not password protected; unpatched internet-facing servers; use of operating systems that were no longer supported by the developer and inadequate anti-virus protection.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves Cathay Pacific, which qualifies as a data controller under the policy's definition in Article 4, as it determines the purposes and means of processing passengers' personal data.
2. The policy requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk (Article 32(1)), taking into account the state of the art, costs of implementation, and nature of processing.
3. The investigation revealed multiple security failures including: unpatched internet-facing servers, use of unsupported operating systems, inadequate anti-virus protection, and backup files without password protection (Case details).
4. These failures constitute inadequate security measures under Article 32(1), which specifically mentions the need for measures including: ""the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems"" and ""a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures.""
5. The policy establishes the principle of ""integrity and confidentiality"" in Article 5(1)(f), requiring that personal data be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.""
6. The brute force attack and subsequent unauthorized access to passenger data (including names, passport details, contact information, and travel history) demonstrates a breach of this fundamental principle.
7. The controller's accountability principle under Article 5(2) requires Cathay Pacific to be responsible for and able to demonstrate compliance with all data protection principles, including security measures.
8. The duration between discovering suspicious activity (March 2018) and employing a cybersecurity firm indicates potential failure in timely detection and response measures required under Article 32(1)(d) regarding the ability to restore availability and access in a timely manner after an incident.
9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of security obligations under Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), and 32(1)."
"The Swedish DPA Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten (IMY) was informed, through information in the media, that Stockholm Public Transport (SL) was planning on giving their employees body cameras in order to prevent threatening situations, to better document incidents, and to ensure that they issue fines to the correct offender when someone travels without a valid ticket. This information led to the DPA to start an investigation of SL.

The purpose of the investigation was to find out if SL had lawful grounds for processing in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR and if SL provided information about the processing in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR. IMY also investigated if SL followed the principles of lawfulness and transparency in accordance with Article 5(1) GDPR.

SL found that the employee body cameras automatically record everything in one minute intervals and then automatically delete the recording afterwards, unless the employee presses the ""record"" button on the camera. The employees are instructed to keep the camera active during all working hours.

SL provides information about the fact that their employees have body cameras to the public but they do not inform travelers about the fact that, apart from video, the cameras also record sound.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13","1. The case involves Stockholm Public Transport (SL) as a data controller processing personal data through employee body cameras, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data (video and audio recordings).

2. SL's processing must have a lawful basis under Article 6. While SL may rely on legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) for security purposes, the Swedish DPA (IMY) found the processing disproportionate because the cameras record continuously in one-minute intervals and employees are instructed to keep them active at all times, which exceeds what is necessary for the stated purposes (preventing threats, documenting incidents, issuing fines). This violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c).

3. SL failed to provide adequate information to data subjects (travelers) as required by Article 13. Specifically, SL did not inform travelers that the cameras record sound in addition to video, which is a violation of Article 13(1)(c) and (2)(a), as the purposes and legal basis of processing must be clearly communicated, and additional information necessary for fair and transparent processing (like the nature of data collected) must be provided.

4. The lack of transparency regarding sound recording also violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as data subjects are not fully aware of the processing activities, undermining the fairness of the processing.

5. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 5(1)(a) and (c), Article 6(1)(f) (due to disproportionality), and Article 13."
"Klarna Bank AB is a company which provides both credit and non-credit payment solutions to approximately 90 million consumers and more than 200,000 merchants in 17 countries through a variety of financial services, such as direct payment, various forms of ""try first and pay later"" services and payment through installments, as well as account information services. In order to provide these services, Klarna needs to process large amounts of personal data. The Swedish DPA (IMY) initially examined Klarna's privacy policy, and noted that there was a lack of clarity regarding many aspects, and therefore decided to launch an ex officio investigation to determine Klarna's compliance with the provisions on clear information and communication to data subjects. During the investigation, Klarna continuously changed the information provided on how the company handled personal data. IMY's decision concerns the information  as it stood from 17 March to 26 June 2020.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14","1. The case involves Klarna Bank AB, which processes personal data of consumers and merchants for its financial services, making it a data controller as defined in Article 4 of the GDPR (where 'controller' means the natural or legal person that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data).

2. As a controller, Klarna is obligated under Article 12 of the GDPR to provide information to data subjects in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, particularly for any information addressed under Articles 13 and 14.

3. Article 13 of the GDPR requires that when personal data is collected directly from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information at the time of collection, including but not limited to: the identity and contact details of the controller, the purposes of the processing, the legal basis for processing, the recipients of the personal data, and the rights of the data subject.

4. The Swedish DPA (IMY) found that Klarna's privacy policy during the period from 17 March to 26 June 2020 lacked clarity, indicating that the information provided was not sufficiently transparent, intelligible, or easily accessible, thereby violating Article 12(1) of the GDPR.

5. The lack of clarity in Klarna's privacy policy also means that it likely failed to meet the specific content requirements of Article 13, such as clearly stating the purposes of processing or the legal basis, which is essential for ensuring fair and transparent processing.

6. Although Klarna made changes to its information during the investigation, the IMY's decision is based on the state of the information during the specified period, which was found noncompliant.

7. Therefore, due to violations of Article 12 and Article 13 of the GDPR, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Uppsala regional authorities notified the Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten - IMY) that a personal data breach had occurred in their jurisdiction in 2019. Based on this notification, the Swedish DPA initiated an investigation into the medical data which the Uppsala University Hospital emailed to patients from abroad, as well as to the foreign hospitals which referred those patients.

According to its internal procedures, once the hospital had finalized treatment to a patient from abroad, a medical report was sent to the patient and the referring hospital. Although it can be sent by post, the hospital gave the recipient the option of choosing their preferred channel to receive the report, which in the majority of cases was via email.

These medical reports have been sent by email without encryption since 2014. Although at some point the hospital began using Microsoft Outlook’s Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, if the email software on the recipients’ side did not support TLS, the emails were sent without encryption. Once sent, the emails and medical records themselves remained stored in the hospital’s Outlook account.

In 2019, after conducting an internal risk analysis and a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) the hospital introduced an encryption solution for secure email.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of medical data, which qualifies as special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, as it includes data concerning health.

2. According to Article 9(1), processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. While the hospital likely processes this data under Article 9(2)(h) (healthcare purposes) or Article 9(2)(i) (public health), this does not exempt them from implementing appropriate safeguards.

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.

4. Article 32(1) further specifies that the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the state of the art, costs, and nature of the processing. This includes, inter alia, the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data.

5. The hospital sent medical reports via email without encryption from 2014 until 2019. Even when TLS was used, emails were sent without encryption if the recipient's email software did not support TLS. This means sensitive health data was transmitted over the internet in an unsecured manner, exposing it to potential unauthorized access.

6. The lack of encryption for such sensitive data constitutes a failure to implement appropriate technical measures as required by Article 32(1), especially given the high risks associated with health data. This is a violation of the integrity and confidentiality principle in Article 5(1)(f).

7. The hospital only introduced an encryption solution in 2019 after conducting a DPIA. This delay indicates that for a significant period (2014-2019), the processing did not meet the required security standards, and the DPIA should have been conducted earlier to identify and mitigate these risks.

8. Article 24(1) requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR. The failure to use encryption for sensitive data transmissions shows a lack of such measures.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to the failure to implement appropriate security measures, including encryption, for the processing of special categories of personal data, in violation of Articles 5(1)(f), 9(1), 24(1), and 32(1)."
"The controller, an eGovernment portal (eUprava), published multiple public documents on its digital bulletin board.  These documents published more personal data than what is permitted by national law (Article 96 of the General Administrative Procedure Act. According to this national law, the controller can only publish the following kinds of data:

* information on the reasons for public notification, 
* the authority which has issued the document, 
* the number, date and type of the document, 
* the personal name or business name of the addressee, 
* the address for service or other permanent or temporary residence if the addressee does not have an address for service, 
* the registered office of the legal person or natural person registered for the performance of activities, 
* an indication of the administrative case, 
* the date of publication of the notification with the warning that the addressee is to take delivery within 15 days, 
* the consequences referred to in paragraph five of this Article, and the place where the document is located.

Additionally, the controller published the following personal data (not explicitly permitted by the ZUP):

* individuals’ date of birth,
* decisions to suspend the procedure for granting international protection, in full.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the controller, an eGovernment portal (eUprava), which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data through its digital bulletin board.

2. The controller published public documents containing personal data beyond what is permitted by national law (Article 96 of the General Administrative Procedure Act/ZUP). The published data included individuals' dates of birth and full decisions to suspend procedures for granting international protection, which are not explicitly allowed under ZUP Article 96.

3. Under Article 6(1) of the GDPR, processing must have a lawful basis. The national law (ZUP Article 96) provides the legal basis for publishing specific categories of personal data. However, publishing additional data (date of birth and full decisions) exceeds this legal authorization, violating the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

4. The publication of full decisions regarding international protection likely involves special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (e.g., data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or religious beliefs), which are prohibited unless a specific condition under Article 9(2) applies. No such condition is evident here, and the publication lacks explicit authorization under Union or Member State law meeting the requirements of Article 9(2)(g).

5. The controller violated the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the published data (date of birth and full decisions) are not necessary for the purpose of public notification, which is limited to the items specified in ZUP Article 96.

6. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that only necessary personal data is processed, as required by data protection by design and by default under Article 25(1) and (2).

7. The publication of excessive personal data on a digital bulletin board constitutes a failure to ensure appropriate security of the data under Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1), as it exposes data subjects to unnecessary risks of unauthorized access or disclosure.

8. The case does not fall under any exemption under Article 85 (processing and freedom of expression and information) or Article 86 (processing and public access to official documents), as the national law (ZUP Article 96) already strikes a balance by limiting publishable data, and the controller exceeded these limits.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 5(1)(f), 6(1), 9(1), 25, and 32."
"During the inspection procedure, the IP established that the controller was carrying out video surveillance at a bar. An outdoor camera recorded the entrance and the outdoor terrace. The first indoor camera captured the server rooms and the bar counter and the right side of the building. The second indoor camera captured the server rooms and the left side of the facility.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves a controller (the bar owner) processing personal data through video surveillance, which falls under the definition of processing in Article 4(2) as it involves ""collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage"" of personal data (images of identifiable individuals).

2. The video surveillance covers both outdoor areas (entrance and terrace) and indoor areas (server rooms, bar counter, and both sides of the facility), capturing images of data subjects who may be identified or identifiable, constituting processing of personal data under Article 4(1).

3. Under Article 6, processing must have a lawful basis. While security could be a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f), the proportionality principle requires that surveillance be limited to what is strictly necessary. The extensive coverage (including server rooms and both sides of the facility) appears excessive and not minimized per Article 5(1)(c).

4. The controller must provide transparent information about processing under Articles 12-14. For video surveillance, this typically requires clear signage indicating surveillance is in operation, the purpose, and identity of the controller. The case description doesn't mention such measures, suggesting a potential violation.

5. Processing through systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale may require a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(1) and (3)(c). The bar's surveillance likely triggers this requirement, and the absence of an assessment would be noncompliant.

6. The surveillance appears to lack appropriate safeguards for data subjects' rights, particularly regarding the right to be informed (Articles 13-14) and the right of access (Article 15), as there is no indication that data subjects are aware of the processing or how to exercise their rights.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to potential violations of the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), and requirements for transparent information (Articles 12-14), along with the likely absence of a required Data Protection Impact Assessment (Article 35)."
"The controller is an employer (company) that had dealt with a mass infection of COVID-19 at the company. To prevent this from happening again, the controller collected the full name and medical condition of employees who were positive with COVID (the data subjects). It then sent out an email to all of the other employees who may have been in contact with an infected employee, by informing them of the person who had been tested positive for COVID. Moreover, the controller did not keep a database of all persons infected with COVID and had informed all employees about their rights under Article 13 GDPR.

The DPA started an investigation ex officio into the processing of health data and whether the controller was compliant with the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 9, Article 13","1. The case involves a controller (employer) processing special categories of personal data, specifically health data related to COVID-19 infections, which falls under Article 9(1) GDPR as data concerning health.

2. The processing of health data is prohibited under Article 9(1) unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller would likely rely on Article 9(2)(i) (""processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health"") or Article 9(2)(b) (""processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out obligations in the field of employment law"").

3. However, Article 9(2)(i) requires that processing be based on Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, particularly professional secrecy. The case does not indicate that such a specific legal basis exists or that appropriate safeguards were implemented.

4. The controller disclosed the identities of infected employees to other staff members. This constitutes a further processing operation that requires its own legal basis under Article 6 and, for health data, an exception under Article 9.

5. The disclosure of infected employees' identities to all staff who may have been in contact appears disproportionate and violates the data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c)), as the same public health purpose could likely be achieved without revealing individual identities.

6. While the controller informed employees about their rights under Article 13, this does not compensate for the lack of a proper legal basis for processing special category data or the disproportionate disclosure of identities.

7. The controller's failure to maintain a database does not rectify the initial unlawful processing and disclosure of health data.

8. Therefore, the processing operations violate multiple GDPR provisions, including the general prohibition on processing special category data (Article 9(1)), the principles of lawfulness and data minimization (Article 5(1)(a) and (c)), and potentially the requirement for appropriate safeguards when processing health data.

9. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
The ministry collected expressions of interest for vaccination against COVID-19 on the website https://e-uprava.gov.si/podrocja/sociala-zdravje-smrt/zdravje/vloga-cepljenje.html. The register then became a list for vaccination. Information under Article 13 GDPR were not provided.,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 58","1. The case involves the ministry collecting expressions of interest for vaccination against COVID-19 through a website, which constitutes processing of personal data directly obtained from data subjects, as defined in Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. Article 13 of the GDPR requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information at the time of data collection, including details about the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, recipients, storage periods, data subject rights, and other relevant information.

3. The case explicitly states that information under Article 13 GDPR was not provided to the data subjects when their personal data was collected for the vaccination list.

4. This failure to provide Article 13 information violates the transparency principle outlined in Article 5(1)(a), which requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.

5. Additionally, Article 12(1) mandates that the controller take appropriate measures to provide information referred to in Article 13 in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

6. There are no applicable exemptions in Article 13 that would relieve the ministry from this obligation, as the data subjects did not already have the information, and the processing does not fall under the exceptions listed in Article 13(4) or other provisions.

7. Therefore, the ministry's failure to provide the required Article 13 information at the time of data collection constitutes a violation of the GDPR.

8. Based on this violation, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The teacher conditioned the purchase of an external camera with the prescribed characteristics (external camera, HD, resolution at least 720p), despite the fact that the student uses a 1-year-old, compatible laptop with an integrated standard built-in camera that supports all monitoring requirements and other remote activities. In addition to the above, the requirements were extended to record the entire room where the student performed the knowledge test (exam) and recording (image and sound), namely the entire time of the test, the disputable recording of ears and wrists, and the hands of students before the beginning of the test. It was also stated in the application that the professor would be able to turn on the camera, including the sound, unannounced during the lectures.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves processing of personal data (video and audio recordings of students) by a controller (the teacher/university) in an educational context, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'personal data' and 'processing'.

2. The requirement to purchase an external camera despite existing adequate equipment violates the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), as it imposes unnecessary processing measures that exceed what is strictly necessary for the stated purpose of exam monitoring.

3. The extended recording requirements (entire room, ears, wrists, hands) constitute disproportionate processing that violates the principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), as they collect excessive personal data beyond what is essential for ensuring exam integrity.

4. Continuous recording during the entire exam period, including potentially capturing background activities and unrelated personal spaces, violates the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e)) and the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default (Article 25).

5. The unannounced activation of camera and sound during regular lectures lacks a lawful basis under Article 6 and violates the transparency requirements of Articles 12-14, as students are not properly informed about when and how their personal data is being processed.

6. The processing operations likely involve special category data (biometric data through detailed physical monitoring) under Article 9(1), which requires explicit consent or other specific legal bases that are not properly established in this case.

7. The coercive nature of these requirements (conditioning exam participation on excessive monitoring) invalidates any claim of freely given consent under Article 7(4), as students cannot freely refuse without academic consequences.

8. The processing fails to implement adequate safeguards for the rights of data subjects as required by Articles 24-25, and likely requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35 due to the systematic monitoring of students on a large scale.

9. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"A controller published online an article linking to a file - a criminal complaint that contained personal data of several individuals. In doing so, the controller did not ensure adequate security of personal data.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a controller who published an online article linking to a file containing a criminal complaint with personal data of several individuals, without ensuring adequate security of this personal data (as stated in the case description).

2. Under Article 32 of the policy, the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing. By failing to ensure adequate security of the personal data in the criminal complaint file, the controller violated this requirement.

3. The data in question relates to criminal complaints, which constitutes special category data under Article 10. This article requires that processing of such data must be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union or Member State law with appropriate safeguards. The controller's publication of this data online without adequate security measures violates these specific protections for criminal data.

4. Additionally, under Article 5(1)(f) (Principles relating to processing), personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The controller's failure to ensure adequate security constitutes a violation of this fundamental principle.

5. The publication of this data without adequate security measures also potentially violates Article 9 (Processing of special categories of personal data), as criminal data may reveal information about individuals that falls under special categories requiring enhanced protection.

6. Therefore, based on violations of Article 32 (security measures), Article 10 (special protections for criminal data), and Article 5(1)(f) (security principle), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In the Republic of Slovenia, in addition to applying for vaccination with a personal physician, a comprehensive data collection on vaccination interest is conducted in parallel via the eGovernment portal, which is not an application for vaccination. Individuals receive completely vague and meager information when applying for the vaccination expression of interest via the eGovernment portal, and additional ambiguity is introduced by various diametrically opposed interpretations of individual speakers at press conferences of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia regarding the significance of this role.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 13,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data (vaccination interest information) by a public authority (the Government of the Republic of Slovenia) via its eGovernment portal, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2.

2. The case states that individuals receive ""completely vague and meager information"" when applying for vaccination expression of interest. This violates Article 13, which requires controllers to provide data subjects with comprehensive information including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, recipients of data, and other necessary details at the time when personal data are obtained.

3. The information provided fails to meet the requirements of Article 12, which mandates that information be provided in a ""concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""

4. The additional ambiguity introduced by ""diametrically opposed interpretations of individual speakers at press conferences"" violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency established in Article 5(1)(a), as it creates uncertainty about how personal data will be processed.

5. The processing of vaccination interest data likely involves health-related information, which constitutes special category data under Article 9. The case does not indicate that any of the exceptions in Article 9(2) apply or that additional safeguards required for processing such sensitive data are in place.

6. The vague nature of the information provided and the conflicting interpretations from government officials prevent data subjects from being able to exercise their rights under Articles 15-22 effectively, contrary to the controller's obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of the GDPR's transparency requirements, information obligations, and principles of lawful processing."
"The company accepted applications via an applicant portal integrated into its website. However, the data transmission was not encrypted. The storage of applicant data was also not encrypted and was not password protected. In addition, there was a link to Google for the unsecured applicant data, which meant that the application documents could be called up by anyone within the scope of a search of the applicant's name via Google.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a company processing personal data (applicant information) through its website portal, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it constitutes processing of personal data by automated means.

2. The data transmission was not encrypted, violating Article 32(1)(a) which requires implementing appropriate technical measures such as encryption to ensure security of processing.

3. The storage of applicant data was not encrypted and not password protected, violating Article 32(1)(b) which requires ensuring ongoing confidentiality of processing systems and services, and Article 32(1)(c) which requires the ability to restore availability and access to personal data in a timely manner.

4. The data was accessible via Google search results, meaning personal data was publicly available without authorization, violating Article 5(1)(f) which requires processing in a manner that ensures appropriate security including protection against unauthorized access.

5. The lack of basic security measures (encryption, access controls) demonstrates failure to implement data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, which mandates appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement data protection principles.

6. The company failed to implement appropriate safeguards for personal data processing, particularly given the sensitive nature of applicant data which may include special categories of personal data under Article 9.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to multiple violations of GDPR security requirements and data protection principles."
"Unauthorized cameras had been installed by the company notebooksbilliger.de at least 2 two years prior to investigation of the LfD and were monitoring, among other things, workplaces, sales areas, warehouses and common areas. The company claimed that the purpose of the cameras was the prevention and solving of crimes as well as the tracking of goods.

Customers were also concerned by the data processing, since some of the cameras were directed towards the sales areas. In some of these areas, people could typically spend longer periods of time, for example in order to extensively test the equipment on sale, and were still being monitored.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a company (notebooksbilliger.de) processing personal data through video surveillance in workplaces, sales areas, warehouses, and common areas, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1), as it constitutes processing of personal data by automated means.

2. The company claimed the processing purposes were crime prevention and goods tracking, which could potentially fall under legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f). However, for such processing to be lawful, it must meet the necessity and proportionality tests, and the company's interests must not override the data subjects' fundamental rights and freedoms.

3. The monitoring affected both employees and customers. For customers in sales areas where they might spend extended periods testing products, the continuous video surveillance without explicit notice or consent likely violates the transparency principle under Article 5(1)(a) and the specific information requirements under Article 13, as data subjects were not properly informed about the processing.

4. The processing of personal data through video surveillance in areas where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy (such as workplaces and areas where customers test products) without a compelling necessity violates the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), as less intrusive means could likely achieve the stated purposes.

5. The case involved processing that continued for at least two years without proper authorization or review, potentially violating the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), as personal data should not be kept longer than necessary for the specified purposes.

6. For processing activities that are likely to result in high risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons (such as systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale), the controller is required to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35. The case does not indicate such an assessment was performed.

7. The German supervisory authority (LfD) investigated and found the processing noncompliant, particularly noting the infringement of customers' rights when monitored in sales areas where they spend extended periods, which violates the fundamental principles of proportionality and purpose limitation under Articles 5 and 6.

8. Therefore, based on violations of multiple provisions including Articles 5, 6, 13, and 35, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the Regulation."

The case involves an organization and its Chair as controllers processing personal data through a signature campaign, where signatories provide consent for being informed and contacted about political activities, indicating political sympathy. This processing involves special categories of personal data, specifically political opinions, as defined in Article 9(1) of the GDPR.

2. Article 9(1) prohibits the processing of special categories of personal data, including political opinions, unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. Here, the controllers rely on explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) as the legal basis for processing.

3. For consent to be valid under Article 9(2)(a), it must be explicit, freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, as per Article 7 of the GDPR. However, the consent was obtained in the context of a signature campaign against compulsory vaccination, where the option to consent for political contact was presented alongside the petition purpose. Article 7(4) states that consent is not freely given if it is conditional on unnecessary processing; here, consent for political contact is not necessary for the petition itself, and the context may have pressured signatories to consent to show support, violating the requirement for freely given consent.

4. Additionally, Article 7(2) requires that if consent is given in a written declaration concerning other matters, the request for consent must be clearly distinguishable from other matters. The case does not specify that the consent request was separated or clearly distinguishable from the petition purpose, potentially violating this requirement.

5. Article 13 requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information, including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, and the right to withdraw consent. The case does not indicate that such information was provided to signatories, which could violate transparency obligations.

6. Due to the issues with the validity of consent (not freely given and not clearly distinguishable) and lack of transparency in information provision, the processing of special category data does not meet the conditions of Article 9(2)(a) and Article 7, making it unlawful under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A public interest disclosure was made to the Hungarian DPA (NAIH) detailing a personal data breach. In the given case, the XI. District Office of Budapest Government Office (In Hungarian: ""Budapest Főváros Kormányhivatala XI. kerületi Hivatala""; hereinafter referred to as ""District Office"") transferred by email (in an Excel sheet attached to the email) the data of 1153 patients to general practitioners (physician) in the XI, XII and XXII Districts of Budapest related to the COVID testing of patients. The Excel sheet was not protected by password or by other means. A person (who was not even a general practioner originally addressed by the District Office) forwarded the above referred Excel sheet and the District Office's related email to the NAIH in the form of a public interest disclosure.

The NAIH examined whether the transferring of patient data by the District Office constituted a personal data breach, the related risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, as well as the breach management of the District Office.

It is worth noting that after the receipt of the NAIH's inquiry concerning the personal data breach, the District Office requested the opinion of the data protection officer of the Budapest Government Office. The data protection officer was of the opinion that the above transfer of patient data by email by the District Office constituted a personal data breach, but that the breach did not result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons since it was only received by general practitioners who are subject to professional secrecy.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves the processing of special categories of personal data (health data related to COVID testing) by a public authority (District Office), which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and constitutes processing of health data under Article 9(1).

2. The District Office transferred health data of 1,153 patients via unencrypted email attachment (Excel sheet), which constitutes inadequate security measures under Article 32(1) requiring appropriate technical measures including encryption, especially for sensitive data.

3. The data protection officer's opinion that no risk existed because recipients were medical professionals bound by secrecy contradicts Article 32's requirement for appropriate security regardless of recipient status, and ignores the risk during transmission where data could be accessed by unauthorized parties.

4. The forwarding of the Excel sheet by a non-intended recipient to the NAIH demonstrates actual unauthorized access and disclosure, confirming the breach occurred and validating the risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

5. The District Office failed to notify the supervisory authority of the breach without undue delay (within 72 hours) as required by Article 33(1), as the breach was discovered through a third-party disclosure rather than through the controller's own detection and reporting.

6. The controller failed to implement data protection by design and by default measures under Article 25, as sending sensitive health data via unsecured email without pseudonymization or encryption violates the principle of data minimization and security.

7. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of Articles 9, 25, 32 and 33 of the GDPR."
"A customer of the Deichmann company claimed that after an in-store purchase he did not receive the correct amount of money back from the cashier. The customer initially did not notice that he paid with a larger bill, and only later noticed and informed Deichmann.

Since the facts were disputed, the customer asked the company to view the video recording in which the customer appeared as he was paying. Deichmann informed the customer that the recording can only be accessed by the police following an official request. The customer filed a police report, but the camera recording was no longer available by the time of the request.

Following this situation, the NAIH conducted an ex officio investigation into the company and found that Deichmann was operating cameras extensively throughout the country, with cameras in all 129 of its stores.

The DPA found that the controller had breached multiple GDPR provisions in connection to data subject access requests. Amongst these, the company did not keep separate records of the data subject requests that it had been receiving.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 18, Article 24, Article 25, Article 83","1. The case involves a data subject (the customer) and a controller (Deichmann company) as defined in Article 4 of the GDPR, where personal data processing occurred through video surveillance in Deichmann's stores.

2. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15 by requesting to view the video recording containing their personal data, which the controller was obligated to provide without undue delay and within one month of receipt (Article 12(3)).

3. The controller failed to comply with the access request by incorrectly stating that only police could access the recording, violating Article 12(2) which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.

4. The controller's failure to maintain the recording until the access request was properly addressed potentially violates the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e)) and accountability principle (Article 5(2)), as appropriate retention policies should account for pending data subject requests.

5. The Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH) found the controller breached multiple GDPR provisions, including the requirement under Article 30(1) to maintain records of processing activities, which should include documentation of data subject requests.

6. The controller's failure to keep separate records of data subject access requests violates Article 30(1)(a), which requires documentation of the purposes of processing, and demonstrates non-compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

7. The extensive camera operation across 129 stores without proper procedures for handling access requests indicates a systemic failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, as required by Article 24(1).

8. The controller's actions collectively demonstrate non-compliance with multiple GDPR provisions including Article 12 (transparent communication), Article 15 (right of access), Article 5 (principles of processing), Article 24 (controller responsibility), and Article 30 (records of processing activities).

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"After being notified and in light of previous interactions with the controller, the NAIH initiated an ex officio proceeding to examine, amongst other things, the ""data management prospectus"" of the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 58","1. The case involves the NAIH (supervisory authority) initiating an ex officio proceeding to examine the controller's ""data management prospectus"" based on notifications and previous interactions, indicating potential compliance issues under GDPR (Article 57(1)(a)).

2. The controller's obligation to provide transparent information to data subjects is governed by Articles 12-14. Article 12 requires controllers to provide information about processing in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.

3. Article 13 specifies detailed information that must be provided when personal data is collected from the data subject, including: the identity and contact details of the controller (13(1)(a)), purposes and legal basis for processing (13(1)(c)), recipients of data (13(1)(e)), and information about data subject rights (13(2)(b-d)).

4. The ""data management prospectus"" likely constitutes the information required under Articles 12-14. The NAIH's examination suggests this document may lack required elements or be insufficiently clear, violating transparency principles under Article 5(1)(a) and specific information requirements under Articles 12-14.

5. Article 5(2) establishes the accountability principle, requiring controllers to demonstrate compliance with all data protection principles. The NAIH's action based on ""previous interactions"" suggests the controller failed to demonstrate compliance with GDPR requirements.

6. The controller's obligation to maintain records of processing activities under Article 30 is relevant to the ""data management prospectus."" If the prospectus doesn't align with required record-keeping, it would violate Article 30 requirements.

7. The initiation of ex officio proceedings by the NAIH indicates the controller's data management practices likely violated multiple GDPR provisions, particularly regarding transparency (Articles 5(1)(a), 12-14), accountability (Article 5(2)), and potentially record-keeping (Article 30).

8. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy as the controller failed to meet GDPR requirements for transparent information provision and accountability, prompting supervisory authority intervention."
"The National University Hospital of Iceland (NUH) decided to engage a genetic company (the Company) to perform blood sample analysis in connection with scientific research on the SARS-2 Covid-19 virus. All patients admitted to the NHU between the 3rd and the 7th of April 2021 and who were diagnosed with the virus had submitted blood samples that were initially processed for clinical purposes. The blood samples were then sent to the Company for scientific research purposes. The competent authorities had authorised the scientific study on the 7th of April, after which the patients were asked to consent to the further processing of the already submitted samples for scientific purposes.

The Icelandic DPA launched an investigation regarding the lawfulness of the processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves the processing of blood samples from patients diagnosed with COVID-19, which constitutes health data and potentially genetic data, falling under special categories of personal data as defined in Article 9(1) of the GDPR.

2. Processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited under Article 9(1) unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. For scientific research, explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) could be a lawful basis, but it must be obtained prior to processing.

3. The blood samples were initially collected for clinical purposes, and then further processed for scientific research by the genetic company without prior consent from the data subjects. Consent was sought only after the samples were sent to the company and the study was authorized, which means processing began before consent was obtained.

4. Article 6(1) requires that processing be lawful, and under Article 6(1)(a), consent must be given before processing. Processing without prior consent violates this requirement, making it unlawful.

5. Article 5(1)(b) on purpose limitation states that personal data shall be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes. While further processing for scientific research may be considered compatible under Article 89(1), it still requires a lawful basis and appropriate safeguards, which were not in place at the time of processing.

6. Article 13 requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide information about the purposes of processing at the time of collection. For further processing for a new purpose, Article 13(3) mandates that the data subject be informed of that other purpose and provided with relevant information prior to further processing. In this case, patients were not informed about the research purpose at the time of initial collection, and information was provided only after processing had already commenced.

7. Article 7(1) states that the controller must be able to demonstrate that consent was given, and Article 7(2) requires that consent be presented in a clear and distinguishable manner. Since consent was obtained after processing began, it cannot be considered valid for the initial processing activities.

8. The processing of special categories of data without a lawful basis, such as prior explicit consent, violates Article 9 and Article 6, and the failure to inform data subjects in a timely manner violates Article 13.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Upon learning that the Chief Epidemiologist had outsourced screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as antibody testing to a hospital and a genetic research company, the Icelandic DPA initiated an investigation into the lawfulness of the processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 14, Article 28","1. The case involves the processing of health data (SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and antibody testing) and genetic data (through the genetic research company), which are classified as special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) of the policy, requiring stricter protections.

2. Article 9(1) prohibits the processing of special categories of personal data unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The Chief Epidemiologist, as the controller, must ensure a lawful basis for such processing, but the case does not indicate that any of the exceptions under Article 9(2) (such as explicit consent, public health requirements, or other permissible grounds) were properly applied or documented.

3. The outsourcing of processing activities to a hospital and a genetic research company implies that these entities act as processors. Article 28(1) requires that controllers use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to meet the Regulation's requirements and protect data subjects' rights.

4. Article 28(3) mandates that processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or other legal act that stipulates specific conditions, including processing only on documented instructions from the controller, ensuring confidentiality, and assisting the controller in fulfilling its obligations. The case does not provide evidence that such a contract was in place or that the processors offered sufficient guarantees.

5. The processing involves genetic data, which under Article 9(4) may be subject to further conditions or limitations by Member States. Iceland, as an EEA member, must comply with GDPR, and any additional national safeguards must be observed, but the case does not indicate compliance with such requirements.

6. The Icelandic DPA's investigation likely found that the Chief Epidemiologist failed to demonstrate a lawful basis for processing special categories of data under Article 9, and did not ensure that the processors met the requirements of Article 28, leading to unauthorized and noncompliant processing.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In September 2020, the Icelandic DPA initiated an investigation on a digital gift card application provided by the Ministry of Industries and Innovation (the Ministry), and developed by the company YAY ehf (YAY). The aim of the application was to issue a digital gift certificate to all Icelanders over 18 years old in order to stimulate domestic tourism in the summer 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After the app was published on 18 June 2020, the DPA became aware that, in order to be able to use the digital gift card, the users of the application had to submit their personal data, such as, email address, phone number, age and gender. Moreover, the users were also required in some cases to give an access to their phones´ camera, microphone, GPS location, calendar, contact information as well as data on USB storage.

The DPA decided to open an investigation to assess whether the collection of users´ data and the acquisition of access rights to their mobile devices by the digital gift card application were in compliance with the GDPR and the Icelandic Act no. 90/2018 on data protection and the processing of personal data. In the context of this investigation, the Icelandic DPA found that the Ministry was the controller of the personal data and that YAY was a processor of the personal data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves the Ministry of Industries and Innovation as the controller and YAY ehf as the processor of personal data processed through a digital gift card application, as defined in Article 4(7) and (8) of the GDPR.

2. The application required users to submit personal data including email address, phone number, age, and gender, and to grant access to device features including camera, microphone, GPS location, calendar, contact information, and USB storage, as detailed in the case description.

3. According to Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, personal data must be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed"" (data minimization principle). The collection of device access permissions (camera, microphone, etc.) and certain personal data appears excessive for the stated purpose of issuing digital gift certificates to stimulate tourism.

4. Article 25(1) of the GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose is processed. The application's default settings requiring broad device access permissions violate this data protection by design and by default requirement.

5. For processing to be lawful under Article 6(1), it must have a valid legal basis. If consent was used as the legal basis, Article 7(4) states that consent cannot be considered freely given when the performance of a contract is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for that contract. Requiring excessive permissions to use the gift card service may constitute invalid consent.

6. As the controller under Article 24, the Ministry is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. The investigation found the Ministry failed to ensure proper data minimization and protection by design.

7. The processor YAY ehf, under Article 28, must only process personal data on documented instructions from the controller. The development of an application that collects excessive data suggests possible failure in implementing proper processing instructions or safeguards.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Since 2015, the Icelandic health authorities had appointed Landspítali Hospital (the Hospital) to conduct border and domestic screening to monitor the spread of infectious diseases. It was agreed that the Hospital was allowed to subcontract services in order to carry out this screening. In June 2020, the Hospital sought the services of a company named Icelandic Genealogy (IG) to conduct COVID-19 screening tests. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was carried out by the Icelandic Medical Director of Health (the Director) in consultation with the Icelandic DPA. The DPA observed that there was no indication that this processing would violate the GDPR. As a result, the Hospital outsourced part of the testing and screening activities to IG.

However, in August 2020, the Hospital publicly announced that they would temporarily relocate part of their own staff to IG’s facilities to use some of their equipment and software (Virlab) in order to increase their screening capacity. Following this announcement, the Icelandic DPA asked the Hospital for specific information regarding security measures related to the processing of personal data, and whether a new DPIA had been carried out by the Hospital before relocating part of their staff to IG’s facilities.

The Hospital disregarded this request, and related part of its staff to IG’s facilities, as planned. The DPA reiterated their request in September 2020. The Hospital then responded to the DPA, apologising for the delay, and explaining that they had began using IG’s facilities expeditiously in order to respond to the increased demand in sampling due to the pandemic.

The Hospital also stated that they had not conducted a new DPIA because they considered that the previous DPIA applied to the processing that would now temporarily take place at IG’s facilities. However, prior to the transfer of some staff members to IG’s facilities, IG only had access to sample numbers sent by the Hospital. Once part of the Hospital's staff started working in IG’s facilities and using their equipment, the IG’s Virlab system registered the names of individuals who had tested positive in border screening, as well as identification codes from samples taken at health centres which could be traced back to the individuals concerned. IG’s staff did not have access to this personal data as registered in the Virlab system, except for three employees involved in its design, programming and making necessary updates.

In November 2020, the DPA began an investigation, auditing the Hospital and IG in order to determine whether the new processing operations conducted by the Hospital's staff at IG’s facilities was compliant with the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 35,"1. The case involves Landspítali Hospital (the controller) processing personal data, including health data (COVID-19 test results), which constitutes special category data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, requiring heightened protections.

2. The Hospital relocated part of its staff to Icelandic Genealogy's (IG) facilities and used IG's Virlab system to process personal data, creating a new processing environment. This change in processing operations (different physical location, different technical system) represents a substantial change in processing activities from the initial outsourcing arrangement where IG only received sample numbers.

3. Under Article 35(1) of the GDPR, the controller must carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) when processing operations are ""likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons."" Processing of health data using new technical systems in a new physical environment constitutes such high-risk processing.

4. The Hospital failed to conduct a new DPIA for this changed processing arrangement, relying instead on the previous DPIA that covered different processing operations (simple outsourcing where IG only received sample numbers). This violates Article 35(1) and the accountability principle in Article 5(2).

5. When the Icelandic DPA requested information about security measures and whether a new DPIA had been conducted, the Hospital initially disregarded the request and then provided an inadequate response. This violates Article 31, which requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request.

6. The processing involved special category health data being processed in IG's systems, where identifiable information (names and identification codes) was registered. While IG's regular staff didn't have access, three IG employees involved in system design and programming did have potential access to this data, creating additional risks that should have been assessed in a new DPIA.

7. The Hospital's failure to conduct a proper DPIA for the changed processing operations means they could not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk as required by Article 32(1).

8. The case demonstrates multiple violations of the GDPR: failure to conduct a required DPIA (Article 35), failure to cooperate with the supervisory authority (Article 31), and failure to ensure appropriate security measures for high-risk processing of special category data (Articles 5(2), 9, and 32).

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The lawyer of the company acting as data controller, Húsasmiðjan, contacted the Icelandic DPA (Persónuvernd) with regards to the installation of a fingerprint scanner system for the company's employees. The controller announced the DPA that it is using the system, and asked for the DPA's opinion on the legality of the processing operation.

The company had used the fingerprint scanner system for the logging in and out of employees in the company's payroll system. When an employee arrived at work they would have to scan their fingerprint, which created a number sequence with a timestamp that was linked to other information on the employee.

The image of the fingerprint itself was not stored and could not be retrieved from the number sequence stored in the system. In this aspect, the number sequence works similarly to an employee's ID number, and is not personally identifiable except for when the system performs the identity verification. Furthermore, encryption (256bit AES) was also used to make it difficult to reverse the process and identify individuals through the raw fingerprint image.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 9, Article 58","1. The case involves Húsasmiðjan, a data controller, processing employees' biometric data (fingerprints) for time tracking in the payroll system, which falls under the definition of ""processing"" and ""biometric data"" as per Article 4 of the GDPR.

2. The processing involves biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying natural persons, which is classified as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), requiring stricter protections and specific lawful bases for processing.

3. Article 9(1) prohibits the processing of special categories of personal data, including biometric data, unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller must demonstrate that such a condition is met, such as explicit consent or necessity for reasons of substantial public interest.

4. The controller did not obtain explicit consent from employees as required by Article 9(2)(a), nor did it establish any other valid condition under Article 9(2) for processing biometric data, making the processing unlawful under Article 9.

5. Even if consent were obtained, Article 7 requires that consent be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Given the employer-employee relationship, consent may not be considered freely given due to the imbalance of power, as indicated in Recital 43.

6. The principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary. The use of biometric data for time tracking is not proportionate, as less intrusive means (e.g., ID cards or PIN codes) are available and equally effective.

7. The Icelandic DPA (Persónuvernd) emphasized that the processing of biometric data must be strictly necessary and proportionate. Since alternative, less intrusive methods exist, the processing fails to meet the necessity test under Article 5(1)(c) and the proportionality principle.

8. The controller's implementation of encryption and non-storage of raw fingerprint images does not negate the fact that biometric data is being processed, as the number sequence derived from the fingerprint still constitutes biometric data under Article 4(14).

9. Therefore, the processing of employees' biometric data by Húsasmiðjan violates Articles 5, 6, and 9 of the GDPR, as it lacks a lawful basis, is not necessary or proportionate, and fails to meet the conditions for processing special categories of data.

10. Thus, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Persónuvernd received a notification of a personal data breach from Breiðholt Multicultural School. According to the notification, an attachment containing sensitive information about earlier students was mistakenly sent by a teacher to new students. The teacher mistakenly sent an email with an attachment that included information about interviews that had been conducted the previous semester. The document contained special categories of data concerning the former students. The comments included information about the students’ well-being, learning outcomes and social conditions. The information was to a large extent about qualities that the students’ lacked. In one case it related to the fact that the child protection authorities were connected. In another case there was information about mental health, and in another case, physical health.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 83","1. The case involves Breiðholt Multicultural School as a data controller processing personal data of students, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation (Article 2).

2. The processed data included special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), specifically information revealing mental health, physical health, and social conditions that could imply racial/ethnic origin or other protected characteristics, as well as data about involvement with child protection authorities.

3. The processing (disclosure via email attachment) violated Article 5(1)(f) as it failed to ensure appropriate security of personal data, leading to unauthorized disclosure through human error.

4. The breach involved special category data processing without any lawful exception under Article 9(2), as there was no explicit consent, vital interests protection, or other applicable justification for this disclosure.

5. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures under Article 32(1) to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, particularly given the sensitive nature of the data, as simple human error resulted in massive unauthorized disclosure.

6. The incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12) as it involved unauthorized disclosure of personal data transmitted to incorrect recipients.

7. While the controller notified the supervisory authority (Persónuvernd) as required by Article 33(1), this does not remedy the underlying violations of Articles 5, 9 and 32 that caused the breach.

8. The breach specifically violated the confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f) and the general prohibition on processing special category data under Article 9(1).

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Icelandic DPA was informed that a bank intended to publish photographs from a children's soccer tournament on their Facebook page. They initiated an investigation on the basis of previous advice from the Persónuvernd, which had directed people working with children not to use Facebook for sharing personal information about children.  The bank replied that the parents and guardians of the children had given consent for the sharing of the photographs, and that they had several legitimate interests for using Facebook to share the photos, including taking advantage of a communication medium used by most Icelanders and building a positive image.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 58","1. The case involves a bank (controller) processing personal data (photographs) of children (data subjects under special protection) by publishing them on Facebook, a social media platform (Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processing').

2. The processing involves children's personal data, which requires enhanced protection under GDPR. Article 8 requires that for children under 16, processing based on consent must be authorized by the holder of parental responsibility, and the controller must make reasonable efforts to verify such consent considering available technology.

3. The bank claims to have obtained parental consent, but the Icelandic DPA had previously advised against using Facebook for sharing children's personal data, indicating concerns about the platform's suitability for processing children's data and the ability to properly verify consent in this context.

4. The bank also claims legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) as a legal basis. However, for children's data, the interests and fundamental rights of the child must be given primary consideration, and the use of social media platforms like Facebook for sharing children's images raises significant privacy risks that likely override any legitimate interests of the bank.

5. The processing involves publishing photographs on Facebook, which constitutes transferring personal data to a third country (the United States) under Article 44. Such transfers require appropriate safeguards under Chapter V, which Facebook's platform may not provide adequately for children's data.

6. The principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection principles are effectively implemented, which using Facebook for children's photographs may not satisfy.

7. The Persónuvernd's previous advice against using Facebook for children's data represents guidance from the competent supervisory authority, which controllers should follow under the principle of accountability in Article 5(2).

8. Therefore, despite the bank's claims of consent and legitimate interests, the processing likely violates multiple provisions of the GDPR regarding children's data protection, appropriate legal bases, international data transfers, and the principles of data protection by design and by default.

9. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On the occasion of a news report, the office of the chief of police in the capital area requested information and suggestions via the social media Facebook. Following this event, the DPA started an investigation into whether such processing complied with Act no. 75/2019 on the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes. The DPA asked the office questions concerning processing data via Facebook by the police and then considered received answers.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 44,"1. The case involves the office of the chief of police processing personal data via Facebook when requesting information and suggestions from the public, which falls under the scope of data processing activities as defined in Article 4(2) of the policy (processing means any operation performed on personal data, including collection and consultation).

2. The processing of personal data by law enforcement authorities is subject to specific regulations, and under Article 2(4) of the policy, processing by competent authorities for purposes of prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offences is excluded from the general GDPR regulation and is instead governed by specific laws (such as Act no. 75/2019 referenced in the case).

3. However, the policy's Article 10 requires that processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures must be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union or Member State law with appropriate safeguards. Using a social media platform like Facebook, which is a private entity, may not constitute processing under the direct control of official authority unless strict measures are in place.

4. Additionally, Article 32 of the policy mandates that controllers and processors implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including encryption and measures to ensure ongoing confidentiality. Facebook, as a platform, may involve transfers of data outside the EU/EEA, and under Article 44, any transfer to a third country must ensure an adequate level of protection or appropriate safeguards.

5. The case does not indicate that the police office ensured such safeguards or obtained authorization for potential transfers via Facebook, which is based in the U.S. (a third country without an adequacy decision per Article 45), and may not have used appropriate transfer mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules as per Articles 46 and 47.

6. Furthermore, Article 13 requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information, including the identity of the controller and the purposes of processing. Using a social media platform may not facilitate the provision of this information in a concise, transparent, and easily accessible manner, as required by Article 12.

7. Given that the processing involves law enforcement data, which is sensitive and high-risk, the lack of demonstrated compliance with the aforementioned articles (particularly Articles 10, 32, 44, and 13) indicates that the processing via Facebook does not meet the required standards for data protection under the policy.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The psychotherapy firm 'Vastaamo Oy's' (hereafter, the Firm) experienced two data breaches in November 2018 and March 2019, where its patient records were hacked by a third party (the attacker). During an investigation conducted by the Finnish DPA, it was found that the Firm had become aware of (at least) the latter data breach at the time it happened.

The breaches were not reported to the Finnish DPA until late September 2020, shortly after the Firm had been subject to blackmail by the attacker. The following months, at least 15,000 patients were also blackmailed. In particular, the attacker tried to obtain monetary advantages from them by threatening to publish their personal patients records, and around 300 records were actually leaked online on the Tor network.

Following this affair, the Firm suffered financially and was ultimately declared bankrupt by the District Court of Helsinki in February 2021.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 1, Article 4, Article 5, Article 9, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34, Article 35, Article 58, Article 83, Article 99","1. The case involves a psychotherapy firm (""Vastaamo Oy"" or the Firm) processing sensitive health data of patients, which qualifies as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, requiring heightened protection measures.

2. The Firm experienced two data breaches (November 2018 and March 2019) where patient records were accessed by an unauthorized third party. Under Article 33(1) of the GDPR, the controller (the Firm) must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The Firm became aware of the March 2019 breach at the time it occurred but failed to report it to the Finnish DPA until September 2020, constituting a significant delay far exceeding the 72-hour requirement.

3. Article 34(1) requires that when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The breach involved sensitive psychotherapy records, which inherently creates a high risk of harm to data subjects (e.g., discrimination, stigma, psychological distress). The attacker's subsequent blackmail of patients and publication of records confirms this high risk. The Firm failed to notify affected data subjects promptly after becoming aware of the breach.

4. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. The fact that an attacker successfully exfiltrated patient records on two separate occasions indicates a failure to implement adequate security measures, such as encryption or pseudonymization, as suggested in Article 32(1)(a).

5. Article 5(1)(f) establishes the principle of integrity and confidentiality, requiring that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The breaches demonstrate a failure to uphold this principle.

6. The processing of special category data (health data) under Article 9 requires additional safeguards. The Firm's failure to prevent unauthorized access and to promptly report the breaches violates the obligation to provide suitable safeguards for such sensitive data.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of multiple articles, including the failure to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay (Article 33), the failure to communicate the breach to data subjects when required (Article 34), and the failure to implement appropriate security measures (Articles 32 and 5(1)(f))."
"During the autumn and winter of 2021–2022, the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the controller) noticed and investigated a data breach in respect of personal data of seconded Finnish staff working abroad. On 24 January 2022, the controller notified the Finnish DPA of the data breach. The controller also notified the affected data subjects.

On 9 March 2022, the Finnish DPA asked the controller for further clarification on the timing of the notifications under Article 33 GDPR and Article 34 GDPR. The controller claimed that the main reasons for the late notifications were the investigation of the data breach and related national security considerations, alongside the division of responsibilities between authorities.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 58","1. The case involves the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the controller processing personal data of seconded staff, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2, since it involves processing by automated means and is not exempted under Article 2(2).

2. The controller discovered a personal data breach during autumn-winter 2021-2022 but only notified the supervisory authority (Finnish DPA) on January 24, 2022, indicating a significant delay from when they first became aware of the breach.

3. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons.

4. The controller's claimed reasons for delay (investigation time, national security considerations, and division of responsibilities between authorities) do not constitute valid exceptions under Article 33, as the 72-hour requirement is strict and allows only limited exceptions not applicable here.

5. Article 34(1) requires controllers to communicate a personal data breach to data subjects without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms.

6. The same delay in notification to data subjects occurred, with the controller failing to demonstrate that any of the exceptions in Article 34(3) applied (appropriate technical protection measures, subsequent risk mitigation, or disproportionate effort).

7. The controller's reference to national security considerations does not automatically justify delay under Articles 33-34, as any restrictions based on national security would require a specific legislative measure under Article 23, which was not demonstrated in this case.

8. The supervisory authority's request for clarification under Article 58(1)(a) regarding the timing of notifications was appropriate, and the controller's response failed to provide adequate justification for the delays.

9. The verdict of NONCOMPLIANT is consistent with GDPR requirements regarding timely breach notifications, as the controller failed to meet the strict timelines stipulated in Articles 33 and 34 without valid justification.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA carried out an investigation into the controller’s processing on its own behalf, after receiving information from the police. The controller is the Kymenlaakso Joint Municipal Authority for Health and Social Services Kymsote. It assesses families that plan to be foster parents for their eligibility. During this procedure, the controller requires parents to file an access request to the police pursuant to Section 23 of the (Finnish) Criminal Data Protection Act, to see if there is a criminal record or status report on (one of) the parents. Such a report would contain valuable information for the controller’s assessment, for example whether someone has been arrested for drunk driving. Then, in the presence of the parents, the controller’s coaches would check the reports for any absolute obstacles to becoming a foster parent. The controller claimed that this information is absolutely necessary for the assessment.

The DPA assessed whether the controller’s processing was in accordance with the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 10","1. The case involves the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses by the controller (Kymsote) during foster parent eligibility assessments, which falls under the special category of data governed by Article 10 of the GDPR.

2. Article 10 requires that processing of criminal conviction data be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union/Member State law with appropriate safeguards. Here, the controller requires parents to obtain police reports themselves rather than obtaining this data through official channels under its control, violating the requirement for processing to be ""under the control of official authority.""

3. The controller processes this sensitive data without demonstrating a proper legal basis under Article 6, as requiring parents to obtain their own police reports does not constitute processing under official authority or pursuant to a specific legal authorization with appropriate safeguards.

4. The processing lacks transparency under Articles 13-14, as the controller does not properly inform data subjects about how their criminal data will be processed, including the legal basis and safeguards, when requiring them to obtain police reports.

5. The controller fails to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure lawful processing of this sensitive data as required by Article 24, instead relying on an informal process where parents obtain and present their own criminal records.

6. The processing violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as the method of obtaining criminal conviction data through parental self-disclosure does not meet the strict requirements for processing such sensitive information under GDPR.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
Finnish DPA received multiple complaints regarding Posti’s (the national postal company) change-of-address notifications data processing activities. Several data subjects received direct marketing communications from different companies after submitting a change-of-address notification to the controller.  Data subjects were not informed of their right to object to the marketing when submitting a change-of-address notification.,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13","1. The case involves Posti (the national postal company) as a data controller processing personal data through change-of-address notifications, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1).

2. When collecting personal data directly from data subjects (via change-of-address notifications), Article 13 requires controllers to provide specific information, including ""the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability"" (Article 13(2)(b)).

3. Article 21(1) specifically provides data subjects with the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests, and Article 21(2) explicitly states that when personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, data subjects have the right to object at any time to such processing.

4. The case establishes that data subjects were not informed of their right to object to marketing when submitting change-of-address notifications, which constitutes a failure to provide mandatory information under Article 13(2)(b).

5. Article 12(1) requires that information provided to data subjects be ""in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language,"" and the failure to inform data subjects of their right to object violates this transparency principle.

6. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes without informing data subjects of their right to object also violates the fundamental principle of lawful, fair and transparent processing under Article 5(1)(a).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the Regulation due to violations of Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1), Article 13(2)(b), and Article 21."
A company monitored employees’ working hours by using location data from vehicle information systems.  The controller had not performed a DPIA for the data processing activity as it had not identified the obligation or need to carry out the assessment.,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 35","1. The case involves a company processing employees' location data from vehicle information systems to monitor working hours, which constitutes processing of personal data as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. Article 35(1) requires controllers to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. Article 35(3) specifies that a DPIA shall be required in particular in the case of ""a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale,"" which includes ongoing employee monitoring through vehicle location tracking.

4. The processing of location data for employee monitoring constitutes systematic and continuous monitoring that is likely to result in high risks to employees' privacy rights and freedoms, including potential impacts on their dignity, autonomy, and data protection rights.

5. The controller failed to conduct a DPIA for this processing activity, which constitutes a violation of Article 35(1) and (3) of the GDPR.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"Following the investigations carried out in November 2019 on Taksi Helsinki’s processing, the Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto found several serious GDPR violations regarding the processing of customers’ audio and video personal data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 26, Article 30, Article 35","1. The case involves Taksi Helsinki's processing of customers' audio and video personal data, which constitutes processing of biometric data under Article 4(14) as it allows identification through physical characteristics, and may include special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) if health or other sensitive information is revealed.

2. The processing of biometric data for identification purposes falls under the special categories of personal data in Article 9(1), requiring explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or one of the other specific exceptions, none of which appear applicable to routine taxi service operations.

3. Under Article 6, any processing must have a lawful basis, but even with a potential basis under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests), the processing of special category data still requires compliance with Article 9's stricter requirements, which Taksi Helsinki failed to meet.

4. Articles 13 and 14 require controllers to provide transparent information about processing purposes, legal basis, data retention periods, and data subject rights, which the investigation found violated regarding audio and video data processing.

5. Article 5(1)(c) requires data minimization, meaning personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary, which was violated by excessive collection and processing of audio and video data beyond what is necessary for taxi services.

6. The investigation found serious violations regarding these processing activities, indicating failures to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 32 to ensure data security and privacy by design under Article 25.

7. Therefore, based on the violations found regarding the processing of special category biometric data without proper legal basis under Article 9, lack of transparency under Articles 13-14, and failure to implement data minimization under Article 5, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Following the disclosure of a data breach, the controller stated that he had modified the forms on its website avoiding any further storage of personal data in a database. Upon instruction by the DPA, the controller signed a Data Processing Agreement pursuant to Article 28 GDPR and provided a report on the measures taken to ensure that a data breach would not happen again in similar situations.

The data controller has further communicated the personal data breach to data subjects pursuant to Article 34 GDPR, also by giving public notice. According to the information provided by the data controller, 9,000 to 10,000 data subjects have thus been directly contacted by letter.

However, about 7,000 data subjects could not be reached due to a lack of contact data. As communication to the aforementioned data subjects would involve disproportionate effort under Article 34(3)(c) GDPR, the data controller gave public notice on its website informing its customers of the data breach. In addition, a bulletin has been published on the controller's Facebook Fanpage.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 34","1. The case involves a personal data breach where the controller is obligated to communicate the breach to data subjects under Article 34 GDPR, as the breach likely resulted in a high risk to rights and freedoms, given that the controller directly contacted some data subjects.

2. The controller communicated the breach to 9,000-10,000 data subjects by letter but could not reach approximately 7,000 data subjects due to a lack of contact data, and thus relied on Article 34(3)(c) GDPR, claiming disproportionate effort, and provided public notice via its website and Facebook Fanpage.

3. Under Article 5(1)(d) GDPR, personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, and every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that inaccurate data are erased or rectified without delay. The lack of contact data for 7,000 data subjects indicates a failure by the controller to comply with this principle, as they did not maintain accurate and up-to-date contact information.

4. Because the lack of contact data is a result of the controller's failure to adhere to Article 5(1)(d), the controller cannot legitimately claim disproportionate effort under Article 34(3)(c) GDPR to avoid direct communication, as the effort required to obtain or update contact data should have been part of their ongoing obligations.

5. Furthermore, public notice via website and Facebook may not constitute an equally effective manner of communication under Article 34(3)(c), as not all data subjects may regularly check these platforms, potentially leaving them uninformed and unable to take protective measures, thus failing to ensure equivalent effectiveness as required.

6. Therefore, the controller's actions violate Article 34 GDPR, as the exemption for disproportionate effort is not applicable due to the controller's prior non-compliance with data accuracy principles, and the public notice is not equally effective for all affected data subjects.

7. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA received a complaint from a data subject, regarding irregularities in the processing of his personal data by Pactum Poland Sp. z o.o. (the controller), which is a loan company. The DPA asked the controller several times to respond to the content of the complaint and to answer questions regarding the case. The DPA wanted to know from the controller, among other things, whether the controller is currently processing the data subject's data and, if so, on what legal basis and for which purpose. Moreover, the DPA wanted to know whether the company has properly informed the data subject before collecting his data and whether the controller has disclosed the data subject's data to a third party and, if so, on what legal basis. Despite receiving the numerous requests of the DPA, the controller did not respond to any of them.

As a result the DPA initiated ex officio proceedings against the controller for not complying with the requests of the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 31, Article 58","1. The case involves the Polish Data Protection Authority (DPA) and Pactum Poland Sp. z o.o. as a data controller, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3 since the controller is established in Poland (an EU Member State).

2. The DPA exercised its investigative powers under Article 58(1)(a) by requesting the controller to provide information necessary for the performance of its tasks, including whether the controller is processing the data subject's data, the legal basis and purpose for processing, whether proper information was provided to the data subject, and whether data was disclosed to third parties.

3. The controller failed to respond to multiple requests from the DPA, thereby violating Article 31, which mandates that ""The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.""

4. The controller's non-cooperation also constitutes a violation of Article 58(1), which grants supervisory authorities the power to ""order the controller and the processor to provide any information it requires for the performance of its tasks,"" and failure to comply with such orders is subject to corrective measures under Article 58(2).

5. Additionally, the controller's failure to respond prevents verification of compliance with other GDPR obligations, such as the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5), the requirement to provide information to data subjects (Articles 13 and 14), and the conditions for lawful processing (Article 6), but the primary violation is the lack of cooperation with the supervisory authority.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to the controller's failure to cooperate with the DPA's lawful requests, in violation of Articles 31 and 58 of the GDPR."
"The Polish DPA (The Office for Personal Data Protection) received a complaint from an individual about irregularities in the processing of his personal data by a Bank, consisting in the transfer of the Complainant's personal data - without his consent - to a brokerage house. In order to determine the facts of the case initiated by the complaint, the Office for the Personal Data Protection, on three occasions, summoned the brokerage house to respond to the complaint and to provide explanations. Specifically, it asked the brokerage house about whether it processed the Complainant's data, on what legal basis, and for what purpose. It also asked how the brokerage house sourced the Complainant's data, whether the Complainant objected to processing, and if so, how the brokerage house responded.

The brokerage house claims that it did not receive a summons containing the questions. However, a copy of the summons was twice sent and served to the brokerage house at the address disclosed in the official register. Therefore, the summons sent to the brokerage house were deemed delivered. As a consequence of the failure of the brokerage house to respond to the correspondence addressed to it, the DPA was not able to obtain the information necessary to examine the case. The initiation of proceedings to impose an administrative fine on the brokerage house did not change the situation either, because the brokerage house claims that it did not receive the letter initiating such proceedings either.

Pursuant to Art. 57 GDPR, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office - as a supervisory authority within the meaning of Art. 51 GDPR - monitors and enforces the application of the GDPR on its territory. Within his powers, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office shall investigate complaints brought by data subjects to the appropriate extent and inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of these proceedings within a reasonable time (Article 57 (1)(f) GDPR). In order to enable the enforcement of such competences, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office has a number of provisions specified in Art. 58 (1) GDPR, authorizing it to conduct proceedings and to obtain from the controller or processor access to any personal data and any information necessary for the performance of its tasks (Article 58 (1) (e) GDPR). Violation of the provisions, consisting in failure to provide the information referred to above, and resulting in a breach of the powers of the supervisory authority specified in Art. 58(1) GDPR, is subject to an administrative fine of up to EUR 20,000,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 31, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a brokerage house as a data controller or processor under the GDPR, as it is processing personal data (the Complainant's data) and is subject to the jurisdiction of the Polish DPA (Article 51 and Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processor').

2. The Polish DPA, exercising its powers under Article 57(1)(f) GDPR, investigated a complaint by an individual regarding the processing of his personal data. To perform this task, the DPA used its investigative powers under Article 58(1)(e) GDPR to obtain from the brokerage house any information necessary for the performance of its tasks.

3. The brokerage house failed to respond to the DPA's summons on multiple occasions, despite the summons being properly served to its registered address as confirmed by the DPA. This failure impeded the DPA's ability to obtain the information necessary to examine the case, including details on the legal basis for processing, purpose of processing, data source, and handling of objections.

4. Article 31 GDPR requires that both the controller and processor cooperate with the supervisory authority on request. The brokerage house's failure to respond constitutes a violation of this cooperation obligation.

5. The brokerage house's non-cooperation specifically violates Article 58(1)(e) GDPR, which grants supervisory authorities the power to ""obtain from the controller and processor access to all personal data and to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks.""

6. Under Article 83(5)(e) GDPR, infringements of the provisions related to cooperation with supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 31 are subject to administrative fines up to €20,000,000. The brokerage house's failure to provide the requested information constitutes such an infringement.

7. The initiation of proceedings to impose an administrative fine did not remedy the situation, as the brokerage house continued its non-cooperative behavior by claiming non-receipt of correspondence despite proper service.

8. Therefore, the case demonstrates a clear violation of the GDPR's provisions regarding cooperation with supervisory authorities and the exercise of their investigative powers, making the brokerage house's actions NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Polish DPA received a complaint from an individual about irregularities in the processing of his or her personal data. As part of the administrative proceedings initiated in order to examine the complaint, the supervisory authority asked the company, Funeda sp. z o.o., to respond to the content of the complaint and to answer questions regarding the case. The DPA also specifically requested that the company provide it with the personal information of the Complainant.

The DPA made repeated attempts to contact the company by phone and by e-mail using contact information provided on their website. Despite receiving the correspondence, the company did not reply to the calls or letters addressed to it. For failing to provide information related to the case, the DPA initiated proceedings to impose an administrative fine on the company. The company, despite being correctly notified by the DPA on its right to express its opinion on the collected evidence and to make its own claims, also failed to take any actions to clarify its position on the matter. To the date of this decision, the company has not contacted the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 31, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a supervisory authority (Polish DPA) requesting information from a controller (Funeda sp. z o.o.) during administrative proceedings initiated to examine a complaint, as per the supervisory authority's tasks under Article 57(1)(a) and investigative powers under Article 58(1)(a) of the GDPR.

2. The controller (Funeda) failed to respond to multiple contact attempts by the supervisory authority, including phone calls and emails, and did not provide the requested information about the complaint and the complainant's personal data, thereby violating Article 31 of the GDPR, which requires controllers and processors to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request.

3. The controller's failure to provide the requested information constitutes an infringement of the obligations of the controller pursuant to Articles 25-39, specifically Article 31 (Cooperation with the supervisory authority), which falls under the scope of infringements subject to administrative fines under Article 83(4)(a) of the GDPR.

4. The controller also failed to engage in the proceedings regarding the imposition of an administrative fine, despite being notified of its right to express its opinion and make claims, which further demonstrates non-cooperation with the supervisory authority.

5. The supervisory authority initiated proceedings to impose an administrative fine based on the controller's non-compliance, which is within its corrective powers under Article 58(2)(i) of the GDPR.

6. The case involves a persistent failure to cooperate with the supervisory authority, which is a serious infringement under the GDPR, and the controller's actions are negligent, aggravating the violation under Article 83(2)(b).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically with Article 31 (Cooperation with the supervisory authority) and the obligations of controllers under Articles 25-39, making it subject to administrative fines under Article 83(4)(a)."
"The controller, Fortum Marketing and Sales Polska S.A. (""Fortum""), trades in electricity and gas fuel, including the sale of electricity and gas to end customers, both in the business sector and to households. Within the scope of its business activity, Fortum cooperates with the processor PIKA Spółka z o.o. (""PIKA""). PIKA provides Fortum with archive services, including digital archives. The parties are bound by a Data Processing Entrustment Agreement from 2018 and a Storage (Document Archive) Agreement with associated services from 2016.

Fortum notified the Polish DPA of a personal data protection breach. According to them, the data of 137,314 customers had been copied. The breach of confidentiality concerned a newly created database containing information on Fortum's customers as follows: name and surname, residential or residence address, PESEL number, type, series and number of an identity document, e-mail address, telephone number, number and address of access point and contract data (e.g. date and number of contract, type of fuel, meter number).

Fortum did not notify the data subjects of a data breach because, in its assessment, there was no high risk of a breach of the rights or freedoms of natural persons. Fortum presented the analysis results that finally established the number of persons to be notified of a personal data breach due to a high risk of infringement of rights or freedoms of natural persons. The explanations indicated that the data of 120,428 persons had been exposed, of which 95,711 persons should have been notified of the breach. The remaining numbers were business customers and deceased persons.

Findings made in the course of the proceedings indicated that PIKA, as a processor to which Fortum had entrusted the processing of personal data of the persons affected by the breach, was also involved in the data breach. PIKA explained that, in case of changes to the systems, the individual departments of its IT division are required to record any changes made to the systems in their internal project management support and control systems. However, when making changes to the system, actual personal data of the Controller's customers were used. The effectiveness of the security features applied was not verified before the changes to the system were submitted to Fortum to resolve the performance issue. The security functions were not tested during the works carried out. In 2020, the Polish DPA notified PIKA of its recognition as a party to the proceedings.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves Fortum as the controller and PIKA as the processor, with personal data of 137,314 customers being copied in a breach, including sensitive information such as PESEL numbers and identity document details (Article 4 definitions of 'personal data', 'controller', and 'processor').

2. Fortum failed to notify data subjects of the breach under Article 34(1), which requires communication without undue delay when a breach is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms. Fortum's own assessment indicated that 95,711 individuals should have been notified, demonstrating acknowledgment of high risk for these subjects, yet no notification occurred.

3. The processor PIKA violated Article 32(1) by not implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security appropriate to the risk. Specifically, PIKA used actual personal data for system testing without verifying security features or conducting tests during changes, leading to unauthorized processing.

4. PIKA, as a processor, acted outside the documented instructions of the controller Fortum, contrary to Article 29, which requires processors to process data only on instructions from the controller. The use of live data for testing was not part of the entrusted processing activities.

5. Fortum, as controller, violated Article 28(1) by failing to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. The breach resulted from PIKA's inadequate security practices, indicating insufficient guarantees were in place.

6. The breach involved special categories of data (PESEL numbers as national identification numbers under Article 87), requiring appropriate safeguards which were not maintained, further exacerbating the risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 28(1), 29, 32(1), and 34(1)."
"In May 2020 Warsaw University of Technology (the controller) notified the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection of a data breach. The breach notification indicated that an unknown and unauthorised person downloaded from the University's IT network resources a database containing personal data of students and lecturers of studies from 2008 to 2020, as well as 169 candidates for studies for the academic year 2019/2020 (a total of 5013 persons).

The categories of data affected by the breach include: first and last name, parents' first names, date of birth, home or residence address, PESEL number, email address, username and/or password, mother's family name, ID card series and number, and telephone number.

The President of the Office for Personal Data Protection has notified the controller of the initiation of administrative proceedings concerning the possibility that the University, as a data controller, has breached its obligations under the GDPR.

In the course of the proceedings, the organisational unit of the University, in order to fulfil its tasks, uses an IT system, within which there is an application (for approximately 10 years) used by students to register for courses and to obtain access to their study history and fee settlements, as well as to prepare certificates, statistics and other documents required by the University. Within this system, lecturers were able to upload files related to the subject they were teaching.

The application was created from scratch by the University's employees, as none of the solutions offered on the market was able to meet the required needs.

There was a second application running in parallel, and both of them used access to the database that contained the personal data subject to the breach.

In January 2020, according to the file's metadata marking, an unauthorised third party with credentials took advantage of the application's file upload functionality by a person with lecturer privileges and uploaded a backdoor file to the application's directory, intended for lecturers to store files. The unauthorized person obtained the application login credentials through a third-party system (the user likely used the same login credentials on different systems).

In April 2020, according to the file metadata marking, a second backdoor file was placed in the application directory. In May 2020, according to the server log marking, an unauthorised download of personal data was made using the file placed in April 2020. According to the author of the initial post-hack analysis report, this file was likely uploaded using the functionality provided by the file posted on the server in January 2020.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves Warsaw University of Technology as a data controller processing personal data of students and lecturers, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The personal data breached included special categories of data such as PESEL numbers (national identification numbers) and potentially health-related information, which under Article 9 requires heightened protection measures. The controller failed to implement appropriate safeguards for such sensitive data.

3. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The University failed to: 
   - Ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of processing systems (Article 32(1)(b))
   - Implement pseudonymization and encryption of personal data (Article 32(1)(a))
   - Establish a process for regularly testing security measures (Article 32(1)(d))

4. The breach occurred due to multiple security failures: 
   - Weak authentication mechanisms allowing credential reuse across systems (contrary to Article 32)
   - Inadequate file upload validation permitting backdoor installation (contrary to Article 25 Data Protection by Design requirements)
   - Lack of proper access controls and monitoring (contrary to Article 32 security requirements)

5. Article 5(1)(f) requires personal data to be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing. The breach demonstrates failure to meet this fundamental principle.

6. The timeline shows the breach persisted from January to May 2020 without detection, indicating insufficient security monitoring and incident response procedures, contrary to Article 32's requirement for timely detection of breaches.

7. The University's use of an internally developed application without adequate security testing and safeguards violates Article 25's Data Protection by Design and by Default requirements, which mandate implementing appropriate technical measures at the time of system design.

8. The case involves processing of national identification numbers (PESEL), which under Article 87 requires appropriate safeguards that were not implemented.

9. Therefore, based on violations of Articles 5, 9, 25, 32, and 87 of the GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The penalised company regularly notified the DPA of violations of the protection of personal data of the Company's customers, which consisted, inter alia, in couriers losing documents containing personal data of the customers or giving documents containing personal data such as: name and surname, address of residence or stay, PESEL (national identification) number, e-mail address, series and number of identity card or other identity document, telephone number and data concerning contracts between the parties.

When analysing the notifications of breaches, the DPA pointed to a significant lapse of time from the date of occurrence of an event causing a personal data protection breach to the date of its discovery by the Company and, consequently, notification of the breach to data subjects and the President of the DPA. The notifications made by the Company in the analysed period of June 2020 included events causing personal data protection breaches from February and January 2020, and even events from 2019.

The Company indicated that it clarifies the cases of violations with the carrier on an ongoing basis in order to eliminate the problem of delays in providing information on data loss. The Company additionally explained that the period of the ongoing pandemic had a significant impact on the timeliness of notifications of personal data protection violations concerning the proceedings in question in terms of verification of the correctness of handling the return document process. According to the explanations of the Company, due to the limitations of courier companies related to the period of the pandemic, the process of verification and handling of return documents was prolonged, hence the information about the events was reported by the carrier with a delay. The Company emphasized that, in its opinion, the actions it undertakes bring effects in the long run, because the percentage of personal data protection violations in relation to the volume of all deliveries is small and it presented calculations for the month of June in that respect.

The supervisory authority found that the Company had not provided sufficient evidence of the measures it was taking to minimise the risk of the infringement recurring.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 31, Article 32, Article 34, Article 83","1. The case involves a company that processes personal data of customers, including sensitive information such as names, addresses, PESEL numbers, and contract details, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR policy.

2. The company experienced personal data breaches due to couriers losing documents containing personal data, which constitutes a breach of security leading to unauthorized disclosure under Article 4(12).

3. According to Article 33(1), the controller must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The case shows that notifications made in June 2020 included events from February and January 2020, and even from 2019, indicating significant delays far exceeding the 72-hour requirement, thus violating Article 33(1).

4. Article 34(1) requires that if a breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The delays in notification suggest that data subjects were not informed promptly, potentially violating Article 34(1), especially since the lost data included sensitive information that could pose a high risk.

5. The company cited the pandemic as a reason for delays, but Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the ability to respond to incidents in a timely manner. The recurring breaches and delays indicate a failure to have such measures in place, violating Article 32(1).

6. Article 24(1) mandates that the controller must implement measures to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, including the ability to respond to breaches promptly. The DPA found that the company did not provide sufficient evidence of measures to minimize the risk of recurrence, indicating a violation of Article 24(1).

7. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against accidental loss. The repeated incidents of lost documents and delayed responses suggest a failure to uphold this principle, violating Article 5(1)(f).

8. Therefore, based on the violations of Article 33(1), Article 32(1), Article 24(1), and Article 5(1)(f), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The penalized entity is a foundation ('the Foundation') whose statutory objectives include, among others: providing legal assistance, legal and psychological counselling, assistance to persons wronged by crime and their families, activities to protect the rights of persons wronged by public institutions, the public health care system or entities operating in the insurance sector.

The supervisory authority received notice of a suspected breach of data protection compliance by the Foundation as part of an criminal investigation conducted by the Ministry of Justice on the theft of the folders. The DPA asked the Foundation to clarify whether the breach had to be reported to the DPA, demanding an analysis of the breach, information on the foundation's data protection officer as well as evidence over discussing the possibility of consultancy from the DPA.

The Foundation stated that it did not report the breach to the supervisory authority, that it did not designate a data protection officer and the analysis of the breach gave a low assessment of gravity. On this basis, the Foundation decided that there was no infringement that requires notification to the DPA.

The Foundation stated that the personal data breach concerned 96 persons in total. The information lost contained their first name, surname, correspondence address and telephone number. For 3-4 of these persons with a polish citizenship, the information lost also contained the social security number.

In view of the failure to report the breach to the DPA and to communicate it to the persons concerned, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings against the Foundation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 57, Article 58, Article 83","1. The Foundation experienced a personal data breach involving the theft of folders containing personal data of 96 individuals, including first names, surnames, correspondence addresses, telephone numbers, and for 3-4 Polish citizens, social security numbers (Article 4: 'personal data' includes identifiers like names, contact details, and identification numbers).

2. Under Article 33(1), the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. The Foundation assessed the breach as low risk and decided not to report it to the supervisory authority. However, the inclusion of social security numbers (a sensitive identifier that can lead to identity theft or fraud) for some individuals increases the potential risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms, making the breach likely to result in a risk (Article 33(1)).

4. The Foundation failed to designate a data protection officer (DPO) as required under Article 37, given that its core activities involve large-scale processing of personal data related to legal assistance and counseling, which likely includes processing of special categories of data under Article 9(1) (e.g., data concerning health or other sensitive aspects in legal cases).

5. Under Article 34(1), if a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The Foundation did not communicate the breach to the affected individuals, further violating this provision.

6. The Foundation's failure to report the breach to the supervisory authority (Article 33), failure to communicate to data subjects (Article 34), and failure to designate a DPO (Article 37) constitute infringements of the Regulation.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subjects are customers at Bank Millennium S.A. (hereafter: controller). They provided the controller with their personal data in March 2019 to have a bank account set up. In May 2019, the controller notified them of the loss of their personal data. However, since the data subjects did not obtain additional information on the breach, in June 2019 they filed a complaint with the UODO (Polish DPA). During the DPA’s investigation, it turned out that, in April 2019, the controller sent a parcel to its Head Office, with several documents. These documents contained, in particular, the following data: name, surname, PESEL, registered address, bank account numbers, CIF number (identification number assigned to the controller's clients) of the Applicant and the Applicant's name, surname and PESEL.

The controller considered the circumstances of the breach, i.e., what personal data had been lost, and assessed this breach in accordance with a methodology based on the European ENISA methodology (a risk management assessment tool by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity). Based on this assessment, the controller considered that the breach is likely to (only) cause a medium risk of violation of the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Hence, it did not notify the data subjects in accordance with Article 34(1) GDPR, only supplying very general information on the nature of the breach, and that the data subjects could use the controller’s free Alert service to minimise the negative effects. Moreover, the controller also did not notify the DPA in accordance with Article 33(1) GDPR.

During the DPA’s investigation, the controller brought forward a number of arguments why it had not notified the data subjects and the DPA, i.e., that parcels are also categorized as ‘lost’ without leaving the supplier’s infrastructure, that the loss of PESEL numbers does not cause a high risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and that the data subject’s personal data was not actually used in an unauthorised manner. Also, regarding the assessment, the controller stated that it considered elements such as (1) the context of data processing (what type of data has been disclosed), (2) ease of identification (how easily are data subjects identified through this personal data), and (3) the circumstances of the breach (what was the security and confidentiality of the data).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 83","1. The case involves a controller, Bank Millennium S.A., processing personal data of data subjects (customers) as defined in Article 4 of the GDPR, which includes information such as name, surname, PESEL (a national identification number), address, bank account numbers, and CIF number.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach when documents containing this personal data were lost during transit to its Head Office, as per the definition of a personal data breach in Article 4: ""'personal data breach' means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.""

3. Under Article 33(1) of the GDPR, the controller is required to notify the supervisory authority (in this case, the UODO) of a personal data breach without undue delay, and where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

4. The controller assessed the breach using a methodology based on ENISA and determined it posed a medium risk, which acknowledges that there is a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Therefore, the exception in Article 33(1) for breaches ""unlikely to result in a risk"" does not apply, and notification to the DPA was mandatory.

5. The controller failed to notify the DPA as required by Article 33(1), which constitutes a violation of the GDPR.

6. The controller's arguments—such as that parcels are sometimes categorized as 'lost' without leaving the supplier’s infrastructure, that the loss of PESEL numbers does not cause a high risk, or that the data was not actually used in an unauthorized manner—do not override the obligation to notify under Article 33(1), as the assessment of risk is based on potential harm, not actual misuse or internal categorizations.

7. Although Article 34(1) requires communication to data subjects only when the breach is likely to result in a high risk, which the controller claimed was not the case, the failure to notify the DPA under Article 33(1) is sufficient to establish noncompliance.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to the violation of Article 33(1)."
"The President of the District Court (the controller) reported the loss of an unencrypted USB-Stick by a probation officer. This USB-Stick contained the personal data of 400 persons, subject to probation supervision. Besides names, dates of birth, addresses, data on convictions etc., the stick also contained sensitive data (health data).

The controller stated that he had implemented a system of rules to secure the protection of personal data (the Security Policy), updated the documentation constantly. To ensure the effectiveness of these measures, the controller provided stationary and e-learning trainings to all of the District Court's employees.

One of the rules forbade the use of private ""information carriers"" for processing business data. However, although users of USB-Sticks (like the probation officer) had the obligation to store the stick in a lockable work bag, measures like encryption and password protection of media, were not obligated. The user was, ultimately, responsible to implement appropriate safeguards for the storage on the USB-Stick. Lastly, although the controller claimed that the DPO conducted ad hoc checks, with additional system security evaluation by the IT department, he did not provide any evidence to the DPA that confirmed that such tests actually occurred.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves the District Court as a controller processing personal data, including sensitive health data, of 400 probation subjects, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation (Article 2).

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, the unencrypted USB-stick containing sensitive data was lost, indicating insufficient protection against unauthorized access or accidental loss.

3. Article 32(1)(a) explicitly mentions encryption as an appropriate technical measure, which was not implemented for the USB-stick despite the high risks associated with processing sensitive data (Article 9(1)) and data relating to criminal convictions (Article 10).

4. The controller's Security Policy placed responsibility on individual users to implement safeguards rather than establishing organization-wide mandatory encryption measures, failing to demonstrate effective accountability under Article 5(2) and proper implementation of data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

5. The controller failed to provide evidence of regular testing of security measures as required by Article 32(1)(d), despite claiming ad hoc checks by the DPO and IT department, thereby violating the documentation and demonstration requirements of accountability.

6. The processing of special categories of data (health data) under Article 9 required higher safeguards under Article 32(1), which were not met through the use of unencrypted portable media.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the Regulation due to multiple violations of Articles 5(2), 9, 10, 25, and 32."
"The DPA was notified of a data breach situation by an insurance brokerage company. The company played two roles in data processing. On the one hand, it was a data controller, and on the other hand, a processor acting for insurance companies.

The data breach involved emails containing identifying data being sent to the wrong recipients. The emails contained analyses of insurance needs and an insurance offer referencing name, surname, PESEL number, town, postal code and other information about the subject of insurance.

The insurance brokerage company, as the controller of the name and surname data, decided to report the breach of personal data protection to the Polish DPA. The company considered that the combination of this data, in conjunction with the data contained in the attached documents, could result in a breach resulting in a risk of infringement of an individual's rights or freedoms. The erroneously sent correspondence contained personal data contained in quotes and calculations from several insurance companies.

Investigation carried out by the Polish DPA revealed that in connection with the incident, several insurance companies, including data controllers, had notified them of the data breach. However, no such notification was received from Sopockie Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń ERGO Hestia S.A (“Company”).

The Company had conducted an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals resulting from the breach, based on which it concluded that it was not obliged to report the data breach to the DPA or to inform data subjects of the data breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves a data breach where personal data (including name, surname, PESEL number, and insurance information) was sent to incorrect recipients by an insurance brokerage company acting as both controller and processor. The Company (Sopockie Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń ERGO Hestia S.A) was one of the data controllers whose data was involved in the breach but did not report it to the supervisory authority (Polish DPA).

2. Under Article 33(1) of the policy, controllers must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. The Company conducted a risk assessment and concluded the breach did not require reporting. However, the Polish DPA's investigation determined that the breach involved sensitive personal data (including national identification numbers and insurance details) that could lead to identity theft, fraud, or other harms, indicating a risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms as described in Recital 85 of the policy (which cites examples such as discrimination, identity theft, or financial loss).

4. Article 4(12) defines a personal data breach as a security incident leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The erroneous email transmission constitutes such a breach.

5. Given the nature of the data (including PESEL numbers, which are unique identifiers), the breach likely resulted in a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, triggering the notification obligation under Article 33(1). The Company's failure to report violates this requirement.

6. Additionally, under Article 34(1), if the breach is likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, controllers must communicate the breach to data subjects without undue delay. The Company did not do so, further violating the policy.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy, as the Company failed to meet its obligations under Articles 33 and 34."
"The Polish DPA received a notification of a data breach involving the personal data of 10,500 persons. The controller was Santander Bank Polska S.A. The cause of the breach was the misconduct of a former employee who had not been not deprived of their access to the Electronic Platform of Services of the Social Insurance Institution once their employment contract had been terminated.

This gave the former employee unauthorised access to personal data belonging to the employees contained in the bank's payment profile,  including their first and last names, address, national identification number, and information related to sick leaves. The bank, however, did not notify the data subjects that this breach had occurred, which prompted the DPA to initiate administrative proceedings against the bank.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 34, Article 57, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a data breach at Santander Bank Polska S.A. where a former employee retained unauthorized access to the Electronic Platform of Services of the Social Insurance Institution, resulting in exposure of personal data (including names, addresses, national identification numbers, and sick leave information) of 10,500 individuals, as defined under Article 4(12) as a ""personal data breach.""

2. Under Article 33(1), the controller (Santander Bank) is required to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. The bank did notify the Polish DPA, which is compliant with this article.

3. However, under Article 34(1), when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The exposed data (including national identification numbers and health-related information) constitutes special categories of data under Article 9(1), increasing the severity of risk, and thus triggers this notification obligation.

4. The bank failed to notify the data subjects of the breach, which violates Article 34(1). The breach involved sensitive information that could lead to identity theft, discrimination, or other harms, indicating a high risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

5. Additionally, under Article 32(1), the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including preventing unauthorized access. The bank's failure to revoke the former employee's access to sensitive systems constitutes a failure to maintain adequate security measures, violating Article 32.

6. The bank's actions also contravene the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 34(1) (failure to notify data subjects), Article 32(1) (inadequate security measures), and Article 5(1)(f) (breach of integrity and confidentiality principle)."
"The President of the Office for the Protection of Personal Data (UODO) ordered the entrepreneur to notify its patients of the breach of their personal data and to provide them with recommendations on how to minimise the potential negative effects of the incident. The controller failed to do so, as shown by the proceedings aimed at checking whether the obligations imposed in the decision of the UODO were fulfilled.

Consequently, the persons affected by the breach knew nothing about it.

Proper compliance with the obligation imposed by the DPA would allow data subjects to understand what the personal data breach consisted of, the possible consequences of such an event, and what steps they can take to minimize its possible negative effects.

As the entrepreneur ignored the decision of the supervisory authority, the DPA decided to initiate ex officio proceedings for imposing an administrative fine.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 34, Article 57, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a controller (the entrepreneur) processing personal data of patients, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1), as the processing is carried out in the context of the controller's professional activities.

According to Article 33(1), the controller is required to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.

4. Article 34(1) further requires that when the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay.

5. The President of the Office for the Protection of Personal Data (UODO), as the competent supervisory authority under Article 55, issued an order requiring the controller to notify the affected patients of the breach and provide recommendations on minimizing negative effects, exercising its corrective powers under Article 58(2)(e).

6. The controller failed to comply with this order from the supervisory authority, as confirmed by proceedings checking implementation of the decision.

7. This failure constitutes a violation of Article 58(1), which requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities and provide any information required for the performance of their tasks.

8. The controller's non-compliance also violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2), which requires controllers to be responsible for and able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles.

9. By not informing data subjects about the breach, the controller failed to provide the information necessary under Article 34(2), which should include at minimum: the nature of the breach, contact details for further information, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach.

10. The controller's actions demonstrate negligence in fulfilling GDPR obligations, particularly regarding breach notification requirements under Articles 33-34 and cooperation with supervisory authorities under Article 31.

11. Under Article 83(5)(e), infringements of orders from supervisory authorities can result in administrative fines up to €20,000,000 or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover.

12. The supervisory authority properly initiated proceedings for imposing an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83, as the controller's failure to comply with the order warranted such action.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."

In order to perform the inspection activities, the inspectors authorised by the President of the UODO presented their official identity cards and submitted personal authorisations containing information on the scope of the inspection to GGK. The Surveyor General of Poland did not allow for performing full inspection activities resulting from the submitted authorisations.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 31, Article 58","1. The case involves the Surveyor General of Poland (GGK) as a controller processing personal data from poviat land and property registers on the GEOPORTAL2 portal, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing of personal data by automated means.
2. The President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO) is the supervisory authority in Poland, established under Article 51, responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR.
3. UODO decided to perform an inspection of GGK's processing activities, which is within its investigative powers under Article 58(1), specifically points (e) and (f), allowing it to obtain access to all personal data and information necessary, and to access premises and equipment.
4. UODO inspectors presented their official identity cards and authorizations, which is consistent with procedural requirements for exercising supervisory powers, as implied by Article 58 and general principles of law.
5. GGK, as the controller, has an obligation under Article 31 to cooperate with the supervisory authority on request, which includes allowing inspections and providing necessary access for the performance of UODO's tasks.
6. By not allowing full inspection activities, GGK failed to cooperate with UODO, thereby violating Article 31 of the GDPR.
7. This failure to cooperate also obstructs UODO's exercise of its investigative powers under Article 58, which are essential for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.
8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to GGK's non-cooperation with the supervisory authority."
"Polish DPA received a letter from the State District Sanitary Inspector in Gniezno informing about the public disclosure of the list containing the addresses of residence of the persons who are in quarantine, which was ordered by an administrative decision and the mandatory quarantine in connection with the crossing of the country border, as well as the address data of persons undergoing home isolation in connection with a confirmed infection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the course of the proceedings, Polish DPA established that unauthorized disclosure of data took place in a waste management company.

An employee of the company, responsible for supervising the printed list of addresses of people in quarantine, left it for a short time without proper supervision. At that time, there was also another employee of the company in the room - a driver, who, taking advantage of the fact that the person responsible for supervising the printed list was directed back to him, copied (recorded as a photo) the list. The driver was to be informed by the person supervising the printed list whether, as part of his or her work, waste is to be collected from the places on the above mentioned list. The driver then made this photo available to at least one person.

The Polish DPA took steps to clarify the situation. It called the controller to clarify whether, in determining the procedures related to the processing of personal data concerning the addresses of persons under quarantine in connection with the coronavirus threat, it has carried out an analysis of the method of distribution of the above mentioned data in electronic and paper versions in terms of threats related to the loss of their confidentiality and to inform what the result of this analysis was.

In the submitted explanations, the company stated, that it carried out the analysis taking into account the circumstances related to the processors' failure to comply with the procedures in force in the company and the circumstances related to the stealing or removal of data. Moreover, the controller expressed the opinion that the lists received included only administrative (police) addresses, did not include first names, surnames and other data allowing to identify the natural person.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by a waste management company (the controller) which received a list containing addresses of persons in quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19, as defined under Article 4(1) of the policy, where ""personal data"" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

2. The addresses of individuals under quarantine or isolation constitute personal data under Article 4(1), as they relate to specific natural persons whose identities could be determined through these addresses, especially in the context of public health measures where such addresses are linked to health-related restrictions.

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), which includes protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Specifically, leaving the printed list unsupervised allowed an unauthorized employee to copy and disclose it, violating confidentiality.

4. The controller did not ensure that any natural person acting under its authority (the employees) processed the personal data only on instructions from the controller, as mandated by Article 29 and Article 32(4), resulting in unauthorized processing when the driver copied and shared the list.

5. The disclosure of the list constituted a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it involved unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The controller was obligated to notify the supervisory authority of the breach without undue delay under Article 33(1), but the breach was reported by a third party (the State District Sanitary Inspector), indicating potential failure in the controller's breach notification obligations.

6. The controller's claim that the data did not include names or other identifiers is irrelevant under Article 4(1), as addresses alone can constitute personal data when they relate to identifiable individuals, particularly in this context where the addresses are specifically linked to quarantine measures.

7. The processing of data related to health status (quarantine/isolation) falls under Article 9(1) as special category data, requiring stricter safeguards. The controller failed to apply appropriate protections for such sensitive data, exacerbating the severity of the breach.

8. The controller's analysis of procedures, as mentioned in their explanations, was insufficient to prevent the breach, indicating non-compliance with the principle of accountability under Article 5(2) and the requirement for data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 25, 29, 32, and 33, among others, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of personal data and insufficient security measures."
"In December 2019 the mobile operator reported to PUODO a personal data protection breach, regarding the subscribers of pre-paid services. The breach consisted in obtaining by an unauthorised person access to such data and obtaining by him/her 142 222 records of confirmation of registration of pre-paid services, containing personal data of 114 963 customers in the scope of name and surname, PESEL registration number, series and ID card number, telephone number, NIP number and name of the entity. Due to the extent of the personal data disclosed, this violation resulted in a high risk of infringing the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

In connection with the incident PUODO decided to carry out in the company an inspection of the compliance of personal data processing with the GDPR provisions. In relation to the infringements found during the inspection PUODO initiated administrative proceedings ex officio in respect of the infringement of the provisions on personal data protection in the absence of implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures ensuring a degree of security corresponding to the risk.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves a mobile operator (controller) processing personal data of pre-paid service subscribers, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller reported a personal data breach to PUODO (the supervisory authority) involving unauthorized access to 142,222 records containing personal data of 114,963 customers, including sensitive identifiers such as PESEL numbers, ID card details, and NIP numbers, which constitutes a breach of security leading to unauthorized disclosure under the definition in Article 4(12).

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, costs, and nature of processing. The breach indicates a failure to implement such measures, as unauthorized access occurred.

4. Article 5(1)(f) establishes the principle of integrity and confidentiality, requiring personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access. The breach directly violates this principle.

5. The breach resulted in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, as confirmed by PUODO, due to the sensitivity and volume of data exposed (including national identification numbers and identity document details), triggering the obligation under Article 33(1) to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay (which was done), but also highlighting the severity of the security failure.

6. PUODO's inspection found infringements related to the absence of appropriate technical and organisational measures, specifically contravening Article 32(1) and Article 32(2), which require measures to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems.

7. The controller's failure to implement adequate security measures constitutes a violation of the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they were unable to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR's security requirements.

8. The nature of the data breached (including national identification numbers) relates to special categories under Article 9(1), though not explicitly confirmed, heightening the risk and the need for enhanced safeguards under Article 32.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to the controller's failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security under Article 32, resulting in a preventable breach and high risk to data subjects."
The GGK published personal data in the form of information obtained from land and property registers (including land register numbers) from 90 poviat starosties only on the basis of agreements concluded with them.,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 57, Article 58","1. The case involves the GGK processing personal data (including land register numbers) obtained from 90 poviat starosties and publishing this data based on agreements with these entities, as described in the case facts.

2. The land register numbers constitute personal data under Article 4(1) of the policy, as they relate to identified or identifiable natural persons (property owners), and their processing falls under the regulation's scope according to Article 2(1).

3. Under Article 14(1), where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject (as in this case, where data was obtained from third-party registers), the controller must provide specific information to data subjects including: the controller's identity, processing purposes, legal basis, categories of data, recipients, storage periods, and the source of the data.

4. The GGK failed to provide this required information to data subjects, as there is no indication in the case that individuals were informed about the processing of their personal data obtained from land registers, violating Article 14(1)-(3).

5. While Article 86 allows processing of official documents held by public authorities, it requires such disclosure to be ""in accordance with Union or Member State law,"" and must reconcile public access with data protection rights. The case mentions only agreements with starosties rather than compliance with specific legal provisions governing such disclosures.

6. The processing appears to lack a proper legal basis under Article 6, as mere agreements with starosties do not constitute one of the lawful bases specified in Article 6(1) (such as consent, legal obligation, or legitimate interests that override data subjects' rights).

7. The publication of land register numbers likely violates the data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c)) as it makes personal data accessible beyond what is necessary for any specified purpose, and may contravene the integrity and confidentiality principle (Article 5(1)(f)) regarding appropriate security of processing.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of multiple provisions including Article 14 (information obligations), Article 6 (lawful basis for processing), and Article 5 (data processing principles)."
"The survey entitled “Diagnosis of student’s home and school situation” examined personal situation of students.

In connection with the survey, the school processed personal data of students, including minors, in particular names and surnames, attended class, indication of legal guardians (parents), family status (single parent, full family), information about death of a legal guardian (parent), separation of legal guardians (parents), their education and professional situation, the number of people in the household, financial situation, health condition and addictions of legal guardians (parents), housing situation and information on social benefits.

The processing of students’ personal data included collection, storage and destruction of those data.

the survey was conducted to identify students who require psychological support from the school they attend. The survey was carried out by class teachers in classes 7-8 of elementary school and in high school classes as in blanco paper forms on direct instruction from school principal.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 58","1. The case involves a school processing personal data of students, including minors, through a survey titled ""Diagnosis of student’s home and school situation,"" which collects extensive personal information such as names, family status, health conditions, addictions of legal guardians, financial situation, and other sensitive details (as described in the case facts).

2. The processing includes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), such as health data and data revealing family circumstances (e.g., family status, addictions), which is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The school did not demonstrate that it obtained explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) or met any other exception, such as necessity for substantial public interest (Article 9(2)(g)) or health purposes (Article 9(2)(h)), especially since the survey was conducted without a clear legal basis beyond the school principal's instruction.

3. The processing lacks a lawful basis under Article 6. While the purpose (identifying students needing psychological support) could relate to public interest (Article 6(1)(e)), the school did not show that the processing was necessary for this purpose or proportionate, as the collection of excessive data (e.g., housing situation, social benefits) violates the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)).

4. For minors, Article 8 requires that processing based on consent (if applicable) must be authorized by a parent or holder of parental responsibility for children under 16. The case does not indicate that such consent was obtained, and the processing was conducted via paper forms under the principal's instruction, bypassing proper consent mechanisms.

5. The school, as a controller, failed to provide transparent information to data subjects (students and parents) as required by Articles 13 and 14, such as the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, and data subject rights, which is critical when processing data directly from individuals (Article 13) or from other sources (e.g., teachers collecting data).

6. The processing violates the principle of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), as the broad collection of data (e.g., addictions, financial status) exceeds what is necessary for psychological support, and the storage and destruction processes were not detailed to ensure compliance with storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)).

7. The case involves processing by class teachers on instruction from the principal, but there is no evidence of appropriate safeguards, data protection impact assessments (Article 35), or measures to ensure security and confidentiality (Article 32), given the sensitive nature of the data.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations, including unlawful processing of special categories of data, lack of a valid legal basis, failure to adhere to data minimization and purpose limitation, insufficient transparency, and absence of proper safeguards for minors' data."
"A loan company (the controller) reported to the DPA a personal data breach after they discovered customer information had been stolen from its database.

In the proceeding, the DPA established that the breach took place after one of the servers operated by the controller's processor (hosting company) was restarted and the appropriate security configuration was not restored.

The controller was notified about this by one of the cybersecurity specialists, who detected the vulnerability and indicated sample, publicly available information. The controller, instead of diligently checking his reports and monitoring the processor whether it duly dealt with the case in terms of checking the security, had doubts as to whether this was an attempt to extort other data, which they indicated in their correspondence to the processor.

As a result, they did not immediately check the identified vulnerabilities in the system and a few days later the data was stolen from this server. The stolen data concerned 140,699 clients of the company. These data included: name and surname, level of education, e-mail address, employment data, e-mail address of the person to whom the client wants to recommend the loan, earnings data, marital status data, telephone number (landline, mobile, previously used telephone number), PESEL number, nationality, NIP number, password, place of birth, correspondence address, registered address, telephone number to the place of work and bank account number.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34, Article 83","1. The case involves a loan company (controller) and a hosting company (processor) processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), given that the breach occurred due to a server restart where security configurations were not restored, exposing sensitive personal data.

3. The controller did not ensure that the processor (hosting company) implemented sufficient security measures, as mandated by Article 28(1), which requires controllers to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees of appropriate technical and organisational measures.

4. The controller failed to diligently monitor the processor's handling of the identified vulnerability, despite being notified by a cybersecurity specialist, violating Article 24(1), which requires controllers to implement measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the Regulation.

5. The stolen data included special categories of personal data (e.g., biometric data in the form of PESEL numbers - national identification numbers) and financial information (bank account numbers), which require higher protection under Article 9 and Article 32, but adequate safeguards were not maintained.

6. The controller's delay in addressing the vulnerability and failure to verify the processor's actions contravened the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires processing in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data.

7. The breach affected 140,699 data subjects, indicating a large-scale processing operation where the controller should have implemented more rigorous security measures and monitoring procedures under Articles 24 and 32.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of the GDPR provisions related to security of processing, controller obligations, and processor management."
"KSSiP notified the DPA about a data leakage from a training platform that occurred during the a migration to a new version. The breach concerned the personal data of 50,283 people.

During their investigation the DPA found that the controller not only had implemented inadequate technical and organizational measures to guarantee the confidentiality of processed data, but also had not properly checked their effectiveness.

Furthermore, the contract that the institution entered into with the processor did not meet the legal requirements of Article 28(3). The contract did not contain any specifications about which categories of data were processed and did not address processor's obligation to process the data provided to it only in accordance with the client's documented instructions.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves a data breach at KSSiP, a controller, where personal data of 50,283 people was leaked during a system migration, indicating a failure in data protection measures as required under Article 32 of the policy (security of processing).

2. The DPA investigation found that the controller implemented inadequate technical and organizational measures to ensure data confidentiality, which violates Article 32(1) requiring controllers to implement appropriate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

3. The controller also failed to properly check the effectiveness of these measures, which contravenes Article 32(1)(d) mandating a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational security measures.

4. Additionally, the contract between the controller (KSSiP) and the processor did not meet the requirements of Article 28(3), as it lacked specifications about the categories of personal data processed and did not address the processor's obligation to process data only on documented instructions from the controller.

5. Article 28(3) explicitly requires that processing by a processor be governed by a contract that stipulates, among other things, the subject-matter, duration, nature, and purpose of processing, the type of personal data, categories of data subjects, and the processor's obligations to process data only on documented instructions from the controller.

6. The combination of inadequate security measures under Article 32 and non-compliant processor contracting under Article 28(3) constitutes multiple violations of the policy's requirements for controllers and processors.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Company notified the Office for the Protection of Personal Data (UODO) of a breach in the protection of personal data of its employees, customers, and patients stored in an IT system. As a result, the Company was deprived of access to the aforementioned system and the personal data contained therein. The Company determined the scale of the breach, which showed that the encrypted databases contained approximately 80,000 employee, customer and patient data records concerning first and last names, parents' first names, date of birth, bank account number, address of residence, PESEL registration number, e-mail address, ID card series and number, telephone number and health data. The Company has not determined that there is a high risk of infringement of the rights or freedoms of natural persons due to the recovery of the encrypted data and has opted out of notifying data subjects of the breach. At the request of the authority, the company provided additional explanations, after which the DPA ex officio initiated administrative proceedings.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 57, Article 58","1. The case involves a personal data breach affecting approximately 80,000 data subjects, including sensitive health data, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 4 (definitions of personal data and special categories) and Article 33 (notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities).

2. The Company notified the supervisory authority (UODO) of the breach as required under Article 33(1), but opted not to communicate the breach to data subjects under Article 34(1), claiming no high risk existed due to data encryption.

3. Article 34(1) requires communication to data subjects when the breach ""is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons."" The exemption under Article 34(3)(a) applies only if the controller has implemented appropriate technical protection measures (e.g., encryption) that render the data unintelligible to unauthorized persons.

4. However, the breach involved multiple categories of sensitive data under Article 9(1), including health data, which inherently carries higher risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms if compromised, even when encrypted.

5. The supervisory authority initiated ex officio proceedings, indicating their assessment that the Company's risk evaluation was insufficient under Article 34(1) and that the exemption conditions were not fully met, as the Company failed to demonstrate that the encryption measures were adequate to prevent high risk.

6. The Company's decision not to notify data subjects, despite the sensitive nature of the data and the scale of the breach (80,000 records), violates the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) and the specific communication obligation under Article 34 when high risk exists.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In May 2020, the authority was notified of a personal data breach. It consisted in sending by e-mail, by an insurance agent, who is an entity processing for an insurance company, an insurance policy containing personal data to an unauthorised addressee. In this way, the confidentiality of data of two persons was violated in the scope of names, surnames, residential or correspondence addresses, PESEL (national identification numbers), telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and information concerning the subject of insurance (passenger car), the scope of insurance, payments, assignments, as well as additional provisions resulting from the agreement. The supervisory authority has been informed about a personal data protection breach by an unauthorised addressee who has come into possession of documents not intended for him/her containing the aforementioned personal data.

PUODO conducted an investigation and received information from the insurer that a personal data protection breach consisting in providing personal data to an unauthorised recipient actually took place. The company indicated that an assessment was made with regard to the risk of violation of rights and freedoms of natural persons. On the basis of the assessment, the Company concluded that there was no breach resulting in the need to notify the President of UODO, because:

1. the customer provided an incorrect e-mail address to which the insurance policy document was sent, 2. the unauthorised recipient has informed the Company, so it can be concluded that he was aware of the regulations and importance of the information he received.

The Company accepted that there is no high probability of negative consequences for the data subjects through unauthorised use of their data and indicated the applied corrective measure in the form of a request to the unauthorised recipient to permanently delete the message together with a request for feedback confirming its deletion.

The authority has indicated to the Company that the fact that the infringement occurred as a result of an error of the customer who provided the agent with an incorrect e-mail address cannot affect the assessment of the event and its classification as a personal data protection violation. It results in making personal data available to an unauthorised person, which means that data confidentiality has been breached. What is more, due to the fact that the indicated data confidentiality violation concerns PESEL numbers together with names and surnames, residential addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, it should be considered that it may involve a high risk of violation of rights or freedoms of natural persons. At the same time, the President of UODO has again called upon the Company to carry out an analysis of the risk of infringement of rights and freedoms of natural persons necessary to assess whether there has been a breach of data protection resulting in the necessity to notify the President of the UODO and the persons affected by the breach.

However, the Company has upheld its argumentation and previous risk assessment. In the absence of notification of a personal data breach to the PUODO and the lack of notification of a personal data breach to the persons affected by the breach, the authority initiated administrative proceedings.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 57, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a personal data breach where an insurance agent (a processor acting for the insurance company controller) sent an insurance policy containing personal data to an unauthorized recipient via email, violating data confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle) and constituting a ""personal data breach"" as defined in Article 4(12).

2. The breach involved sensitive personal data, including national identification numbers (PESEL), names, addresses, contact details, and insurance information. The processing of national identification numbers is subject to specific safeguards under Article 87, and the combination of identifiers increases the risk of harm to data subjects.

3. Under Article 33(1), the controller (insurance company) is required to notify the supervisory authority (PUODO) of a personal data breach without undue delay and no later than 72 hours after becoming aware, unless the breach is ""unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons."" The company incorrectly assessed the risk and failed to notify, arguing that the recipient's awareness of regulations negated risk, which contradicts Article 33's threshold requiring notification unless risk is unlikely.

4. The company's risk assessment focused on the customer providing an incorrect email and the recipient's awareness, but Article 33 requires an objective evaluation of the breach's potential consequences. The presence of PESEL numbers (a unique identifier) with other personal data creates a high risk of identity theft, fraud, or other misuse, triggering the notification obligation under Article 33(1).

5. Additionally, under Article 34(1), if the breach is ""likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,"" the controller must communicate the breach to the data subjects without undue delay. The company failed to do so, relying on the same flawed risk assessment.

6. The company's corrective measure (requesting deletion from the recipient) does not eliminate the notification obligations under Articles 33 and 34, as the breach had already occurred, and the risk remained due to the sensitivity of the data disclosed.

7. The supervisory authority (PUODO) correctly identified that the breach resulted from the controller's processing activity (sending documents via email without adequate verification mechanisms), and the controller remains responsible under Article 24 for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance, including validating contact details.

8. The case violates Article 33 (notification to supervisory authority), Article 34 (communication to data subjects), and Article 5(1)(f) (confidentiality principle), as the controller failed to uphold its obligations following the breach.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"During the examinations held at the end of May 2020 in the form of videoconferencing, student identification took place. After the exam, the recordings of the exams were available not only to the examinees but also to other people with access to the system. Besides, using a direct link, any outsider could access the exam recordings and the data of the examined students presented during the identification.

The university had notified neither the DPA, nor the data subjects. The controller argued that it was not necessary to notify the UODO in relation to the breach because, in its view, the risk to the rights or freedoms of those affected by the incident was low.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, specifically student identification data and exam recordings, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR, as it relates to identifiable natural persons.

2. The unauthorized access to these recordings by other people with system access and outsiders via a direct link constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it involves a breach of security leading to unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data.

3. Under Article 33(1), the controller (university) is required to notify the supervisory authority (DPA) of a personal data breach without undue delay and within 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

4. The university did not notify the DPA, arguing that the risk was low. However, the accessibility of personal data to outsiders via a direct link indicates a potential risk to the rights and freedoms of students, such as privacy violations, identity theft, or other harms, which contradicts the university's assessment.

5. Article 33(1) places the burden on the controller to demonstrate that the breach is unlikely to result in a risk. The university failed to provide adequate justification for this assessment, as the widespread unauthorized access suggests a significant risk, thus violating Article 33.

6. Additionally, under Article 32(1), the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The fact that outsiders could access the data via a direct link indicates a failure in security measures, such as access controls or encryption, which is a violation of Article 32.

7. Furthermore, Article 34(1) requires communication to the data subject when a breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. Even if the risk was not deemed high, the university should have considered notification under Article 33, and the lack of any communication to data subjects further compounds the noncompliance.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically with Articles 33 and 32."
"The Polish DPA received information about a personal data breach from a person who became an unauthorized recipient of personal data. The breach involved sending an email with an unencrypted, non-password protected attachment containing personal data of several hundred people. The sender of the e-mail was a co-worker of the sanctioned company. The Polish DPA asked the company to explain the circumstances of the incident, to present an analysis of the incident and to assess whether, in connection with the situation, there was a need to notify the supervisory authority of the breach and the persons affected by it. The penalized entity indicated that an assessment was made in terms of the risk of infringement of rights and freedoms of natural persons, on the basis of which the company concluded that there was no infringement resulting in the need to notify the DPA. Moreover, the company considered that due to the prompt actions taken, such as the declaration of an unauthorized addressee that he/she had permanently destroyed an attachment he/she was not authorized to receive, the possibility of the occurrence of negative consequences of this event for data subjects in the future was eliminated. Due to the failure to report the data protection breach, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings against the company, which in the course of the proceedings maintained its previous positions presented in correspondence with the DPA and still failed to report the breach to the supervisory authority.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 33,"1. The case involves a personal data breach where an unencrypted, non-password protected email attachment containing personal data of several hundred people was sent to an unauthorized recipient, as reported to the Polish DPA (Article 4 defines 'personal data breach' as a security incident leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data).

2. Under Article 33(1), controllers must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. The company conducted a risk assessment and concluded that no notification was necessary because the unauthorized recipient claimed to have permanently destroyed the data, thereby eliminating future risks. However, Article 33(1) requires notification unless the breach is unlikely to result in any risk from the outset, not based on subsequent mitigation actions.

4. The breach involved sensitive personal data of several hundred individuals, which inherently carries a risk to rights and freedoms, such as potential identity theft or privacy violations, especially since the data was unencrypted and non-password protected (Article 32 emphasizes the need for appropriate security measures, including encryption).

5. The company's reliance on the recipient's promise to delete the data does not negate the initial risk posed by the breach, as the data was already exposed. Article 33(3) requires the notification to include the nature of the breach, categories of data subjects affected, and likely consequences, all of which were present here.

6. The Polish DPA initiated proceedings due to the failure to report, indicating that the breach met the threshold for notification under Article 33. The company's persistent refusal to report despite DPA inquiries further demonstrates noncompliance.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy, specifically violating Article 33(1) of the GDPR."
"A university employee used their private computer for business purposes, including for processing the personal data of study candidates at SGGW. The employee's device was stolen, which led to the personal data of up to 100000 data subjects being compromised.

Furthermore, the records included the data of candidates from the last 5 years, although the prescribed storage period at SGGW was 3 months from the completion of the recruitment process. Among others, the data included contact details, grades from diplomas, average grade from studies, and the field of study for which the candidate was applying.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 30, Article 32, Article 38, Article 39, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (contact details, grades, average grades, and field of study) of study candidates by a university employee, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 4 (definitions of personal data and processing).

2. The university (SGGW) acts as a controller under Article 4, as it determines the purposes and means of processing the personal data of candidates.

3. The employee used a private computer for business purposes, including processing personal data, which likely lacked adequate security measures, violating Article 32 (security of processing). Article 32 requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, such as protection against unauthorized access or theft.

4. The personal data was stored for 5 years, whereas the prescribed storage period at SGGW was only 3 months from the completion of the recruitment process. This violates the principle of storage limitation in Article 5(1)(e), which states that personal data must be kept in a form that permits identification for no longer than necessary for the purposes.

5. The theft of the device led to a personal data breach compromising up to 100,000 data subjects, indicating a failure to protect data confidentiality and integrity, as required by Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality) and Article 32.

6. Under Article 33, the controller must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay after becoming aware of it. The case does not mention notification, but the breach itself suggests a failure in breach response, contributing to noncompliance.

7. Additionally, storing data beyond the necessary period may violate the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c), as more data was retained than needed.

8. Therefore, based on violations of Article 5(1)(e), Article 32, and implied violations of Article 33, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The President of the UODO decided to conduct inspection activities at a company Vis Consulting Sp. z o.o. which provides telemarketing services to other companies - one of which was a subject of a decision issued earlier by the UODO. The supervisory authority found it necessary to conduct inspection activities at the entity which actually operated the telephone calls and processed the data.

When arrived at the company's registered address, the UODO’s inspectors did not find any representatives of the Vis Consulting Sp. z o.o. After the back-and-forth communication between the UODO representatives and the company's proxy, the latter informed the UODO on the phone that the inspection cannot take place.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 31,"1. The case involves the President of the UODO (a supervisory authority under GDPR) attempting to conduct inspection activities at Vis Consulting Sp. z o.o., a company processing personal data through telemarketing services, as part of its investigative powers under Article 58(1) of the GDPR.

2. Article 58(1) grants supervisory authorities extensive investigative powers, including: ""to obtain, from the controller and the processor, access to all personal data and to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks"" (Article 58(1)(e)) and ""to obtain access to any premises of the controller and the processor, including to any data processing equipment and means, in accordance with Union or Member State procedural law"" (Article 58(1)(f)).

3. Article 31 of the GDPR explicitly states: ""The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.""

4. In this case, Vis Consulting Sp. z o.o. failed to cooperate with the UODO's inspection by:
   - Not having representatives available at their registered address during the inspection attempt
   - Subsequently informing the UODO that the inspection ""cannot take place""
   - Effectively refusing access to their premises and processing activities

5. This refusal to cooperate and provide access constitutes a direct violation of:
   - The cooperation obligation under Article 31
   - The supervisory authority's investigative powers under Article 58(1)(e) and (f)

6. The company's actions prevented the supervisory authority from performing its lawful tasks of monitoring and enforcing GDPR compliance, which is particularly relevant given that Vis Consulting was processing personal data on behalf of another company that had previously been subject to a UODO decision.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"In November 2018, the Company reported to the President of the UODO two breaches of personal data protection, which concerned unauthorised access to the database of customers of online shops and obtaining by an unauthorised person access to the account of the Company's employee and, consequently, obtaining personal data of customers shopping in the above-mentioned online shops. In December 2018 the Company reported another infringement consisting in gaining unauthorised access to the Company's employee account. The employees of UODO conducted an inspection in the Company.

The DPA found that the Company violated the principle of confidentiality as a result of two attempts to gain access to the Company's employee panel and access to the database of all the Company's clients by unauthorised persons. The access to the Company's employee panel and to the data of all the Company's clients from the Company's database system resulted in the materialisation of the risk of infringement of rights and the freedom of natural persons whose data are processed by the Company in the form of the application of the method called phishing, which is aimed at extracting data, e.g. credentials to a bank account by impersonating the Company in SMS messages and using the fact of making an order by the customer.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves the Company, which is a data controller as defined in Article 4(7) of the policy, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data of its customers.

2. The Company experienced multiple personal data breaches involving unauthorized access to its employee panel and customer database, which constitutes a breach of security leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures."" The Company's failure to prevent unauthorized access through phishing attacks violates this principle of integrity and confidentiality.

4. Article 32(1) requires controllers to ""implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,"" including measures such as encryption and the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems. The repeated breaches indicate the Company failed to implement such measures adequately.

5. Article 32(2) further requires that controllers ensure any natural person acting under their authority who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller. The unauthorized access to employee accounts suggests insufficient controls over access credentials.

6. The breaches resulted in the materialization of risks to data subjects, including potential phishing attacks using the compromised data to extract banking credentials, which demonstrates a failure to protect against unauthorized processing as required by Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 regarding the implementation of appropriate security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of personal data."
"The decision of the UODO’s President concerned the proceedings related to the activity of a company which processed the data subjects’ data obtained from publicly available sources, inter alia from the Central Electronic Register and Information on Economic Activity, and processed the data for commercial purposes. The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. In total, the company has 7'594'636 records of data concerning natural persons, and the company fulfilled the information obligation in relation to only 682'439 persons in relation to whom it has email addresses within the database record. The company raised the ground that the communication by registered letter would cost its turnover for the year 2018, which would constitute a ""disproportionate effort"" and would critically disturb the functioning of the company.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 14,"1. The case involves a company processing personal data of entrepreneurs obtained from publicly available sources (Central Electronic Register and Information on Economic Activity) for commercial purposes, making it a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The controller failed to provide the information required under Article 14(1)-(3) of the GDPR (information where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject) to the majority of data subjects (6,912,197 out of 7,594,636), only fulfilling this obligation for those whose email addresses were available (682,439 persons).

3. Article 14(1) requires controllers to provide specific information to data subjects when personal data have not been obtained from them, including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, categories of personal data, and other necessary details to ensure fair and transparent processing.

4. The controller attempted to rely on Article 14(5)(b), which exempts from the information obligation where providing such information ""proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort,"" but merely posting an information clause on its website does not satisfy the requirement for appropriate alternative measures under this provision.

5. Article 14(5)(b) requires that when relying on the disproportionate effort exemption, the controller must ""take appropriate measures to protect the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available"" - passive website posting without active communication to affected data subjects does not constitute appropriate measures.

6. The controller's argument that registered communication would cost its entire 2018 turnover does not automatically justify non-compliance, as GDPR principles (Article 5) require controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, including transparent information provision.

7. The scale of non-compliance (affecting over 6.9 million data subjects) demonstrates a systematic failure to meet transparency requirements under Articles 12-14 of the GDPR, which are fundamental to ensuring fair processing and enabling data subjects to exercise their rights.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically violating Article 14's information obligations and the broader principles of transparency and accountability under Articles 5 and 12."
"The DPA verified GDPR compliance of a controller, a television broadcaster, in connection with the use of cookies in the operation of multimedia websites.

The operator of the website declared the use of cookies to set the username or language and for analytical purposes.

The inspection revealed that the controller fulfilled the information obligation towards the data subject by publishing its privacy policy on the website. However, the user was not notified about its update. Until 25 May 2020, the information was not provided in an easily accessible manner, as it was necessary to search for it. In addition, the information was incomplete and outdated (especially references to legislation).

It was further verified that the controller had taken technical and organizational measures within the meaning of Article 32 GDPR and documented it in the privacy policy. The security measures had been regularly updated.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 12,"1. The case involves a controller (television broadcaster) processing personal data through the use of cookies on its website, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, since it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The controller failed to provide information to data subjects in an easily accessible manner until after 25 May 2020, as users had to search for the privacy policy. This violates Article 12(1) GDPR, which requires controllers to provide information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 ""in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""

3. The information provided was incomplete and outdated, particularly regarding references to legislation. This violates Article 13 GDPR, which mandates that controllers must provide specific information at the time of data collection, including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, and other essential details necessary for fair and transparent processing.

4. The controller did not notify users about updates to the privacy policy. While the GDPR does not explicitly require notification of every update, changes that affect the processing of personal data or the rights of data subjects should be communicated to ensure ongoing transparency, as implied by the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) and the accountability principle.

5. Although the controller implemented and updated technical and organizational security measures per Article 32 GDPR, which is compliant, this does not mitigate the violations related to transparency and information obligations.

6. Therefore, due to the failures in providing easily accessible, complete, and up-to-date information as required by Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"When testing a new scanning tool, Coop Danmark A/S had become aware that it was storing personal information on the company's shared drive without sufficient access control. The information concerned 477 employees and external consultants. It included, among other things, health information, financial information, and social security numbers.

Some information was placed in the folders by the data subjects themselves, and the controller saved other information as part of the employment processes. The personal data related to the time period from 2013 until 2017, when there was not the same policy for user management as the company has today.

On 12 June 2021, the controller reported the data breach to the supervisory authority. After three months, it initiated the notification of affected data subjects. At the same time, it also started moving the information to a more secure solution with better user management and logging.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves Coop Danmark A/S as a data controller processing personal data of 477 employees and external consultants, including special categories of data (health information, financial information, and social security numbers) under Article 9(1), which requires heightened protection.

2. The controller stored personal data on a shared drive without sufficient access controls from 2013 to 2017, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.""

3. The processing of health information and other sensitive data without adequate safeguards contravenes Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless specific conditions under Article 9(2) are met. The case does not indicate that any of these conditions (e.g., explicit consent or necessity for employment purposes) were properly applied or documented.

4. The controller became aware of the breach through testing but delayed notifying data subjects for three months after reporting to the supervisory authority. Article 34 requires communication of a personal data breach to the data subject ""without undue delay"" when it is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. Given the sensitive nature of the data, this delay constitutes a violation.

5. The controller's failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), is evident from the lack of access controls and the storage of sensitive data in an insecure shared drive.

6. The controller's actions also violate the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they failed to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR's security and breach notification requirements.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Lillestrom municipality notified the Norwegian DPA about a personal data breach concerning a document they had published on their website, where they had forgotten to classify the appendices as exempt from public disclosure. The caseworker also failed to notice the error. The document then went through two additional manual quality controls without the error being detected and it was only discovered after a local journalist notified them.

The document contained information and personal data about a pupil, including name, birth date, name and address of their parents and their description of their child, description and assessment of the pupil's behaviour and educational challenges from both the school and other public authorities, as well as a concrete assessment of how much special needs tutoring the pupil needs, the pupil's own description of their well-being at home and at school, their tests and assessments and potential diagnoses like dyslexia or ADHD.

The document was available online for about two days and was accessed by four different IP addresses before the municipality managed to remove it.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 32","1. The case involves Lillestrom municipality acting as a data controller processing personal data of a pupil, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 4(7) and is subject to the regulation's requirements.

2. The personal data processed includes special categories of data under Article 9(1), specifically health data (potential diagnoses like ADHD or dyslexia) and other sensitive information about the pupil's family situation, behavior assessments, and educational challenges, which require heightened protection measures.

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), given the sensitive nature of the data and the potential high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject.

4. The breach occurred due to multiple human errors (failure to properly classify appendices, and three separate manual quality control checks missing the error), indicating insufficient organisational measures and staff training to ensure the security of processing, violating Article 32(1)(b) which requires the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems.

5. The personal data breach involved the accidental publication of sensitive personal data on a public website, constituting unauthorised disclosure of personal data as defined in Article 4(12), which the controller is required to prevent under the integrity and confidentiality principle of Article 5(1)(f).

6. While the controller notified the supervisory authority of the breach as likely required under Article 33, the fundamental violation lies in the failure to prevent the breach through appropriate security measures, particularly for special category data which requires additional safeguards under Article 9.

7. The duration of the breach (approximately two days) and the fact that four different IP addresses accessed the document demonstrate that the breach actually occurred and personal data was disclosed, resulting in a violation of the data subject's rights to protection of their personal data.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to failures to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of processing as required by Articles 5(1)(f), 9, and 32 of the GDPR."
"In summer 2021, the Danish DPA conducted inspections in selected municipalities. The DPA focused on the municipalities' way of administering access rights to personal data of children and young people, especially in the school area. In connection with the Gladsaxe Municipality, it inspected whether the controller withdrew terminated employees' access rights to its electronic case and document management system (SBSYS). The inspection showed that the controller had a comprehensive information security handbook regulating access rights management. However, in one instance, the DPA found that the controller did not follow the procedure of reviewing whether terminated employees still had an active user account. As a result, the DPA also assumed that the user [X] had access to SBSYS even after the employee's resignation.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Gladsaxe Municipality as a controller processing personal data through an electronic case and document management system (SBSYS), which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing of personal data by automated means.

2. GDPR Article 5(1)(f) stipulates that personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

3. GDPR Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data.

4. The Danish DPA found that the controller did not follow its own access rights management procedure, as outlined in its information security handbook, by failing to review and revoke access rights for terminated employees, specifically for user [X] who retained access to SBSYS after resignation.

5. This failure to revoke access rights constitutes a lack of appropriate organisational measures under Article 32, as it allows for potential unauthorized access to personal data, violating the confidentiality and integrity principles of Article 5(1)(f).

6. Additionally, GDPR Article 24 requires controllers to implement appropriate measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR, and the controller's failure to adhere to its own procedures indicates a failure to demonstrate such compliance.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with GDPR due to violations of security obligations under Articles 5(1)(f) and 32."
"In September 2021, the Hungarian DPA initiated an ex officio investigation against Budapest Bank Zrt. (hereinafter the Bank) related to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software applied to the audio recordings of customer service telephone conversations between May 2018 and the start of the investigation.

According to the Bank, the software used speech signal processing based on AI to identify periods of silence, different voices talking at the same time, key words, and emotional elements (such as voice speed, volume and pitch) within the recorded sound files in order to identify customer dissatisfaction. Once the software had made an automated decision to identify calls according to these criteria, a Bank employee then listened to the recordings, and made call-backs to customers in order to handle and attempt to resolve any customer dissatisfaction issues.

The Bank stated that its legal basis for this processing was based on legitimate interest, and its purpose was to conduct call quality control, to prevent complaints and customer churn, as well as to increase efficiency.

The Bank stated that customers were informed at the beginning of the calls that they were being recorded, but admitted that they did not inform them that the AI software would be used to analyse the calls, since detailed information in this regard would make the introduction to the calls too long, outlasting many of the simple queries made by customers when calling the Bank. The Bank also claimed that the system did not store any identifiable personal data, or perform automated decision-making in order to create personal profiles.

Additionally, in a Data Protection Impact Assessment carried out by the Bank, the Data Protection Officer stated that: “The purpose of the processing is lawful on the basis of the rights of the data subjects and the business interests of the Bank, there is no direct or indirect legal prohibition. The processing is high-risk for several reasons, in particular the novelty of the technology used, as the audio recordings are analysed and findings are made automatically by artificial intelligence. The aggregate data is suitable for profiling or scoring for both sets of data subjects [customers and employees], and although no automated decision making is involved, the data processing may have legal effects on the data subjects. The high risk is mitigated by the controller through measures identified in the impact assessment, such as human decision-making at the end of automated processing. The exercise of data subjects' rights is ensured in accordance with standard practice.”",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24, Article 25","1. The case involves Budapest Bank Zrt. processing personal data through AI analysis of customer service calls, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The Bank claimed legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f)) as its legal basis for processing. However, the processing involved analysis of emotional elements (voice speed, volume, pitch) which could reveal special categories of personal data related to emotional states and potentially health information, requiring explicit consent under Article 9(1) rather than legitimate interest.

3. The Bank failed to provide adequate information to data subjects about the AI processing as required by Article 13(1)(c) and (f), which mandates informing data subjects about the purposes of processing and the legal basis. Customers were only informed about recording, not about AI analysis for emotional detection.

4. The processing involved automated analysis of emotional states, which constitutes profiling under Article 4(4) (""evaluation of personal aspects relating to a natural person""), requiring additional safeguards under Article 22(2)(b) and meaningful information about the logic involved under Article 15(1)(h), which were not provided.

5. The Data Protection Impact Assessment conducted by the Bank acknowledged the high-risk nature of the processing due to the novel technology and potential for profiling, yet the mitigation measures (human decision-making) were insufficient to address the fundamental violations of transparency and lawful basis requirements under Articles 5(1)(a) and 6.

6. The Bank's argument that detailed information would make call introductions too long violates Article 12(1), which requires information to be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.

7. The processing of emotional data without proper safeguards violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the extent of processing (emotional analysis) was not necessary for the claimed purposes of quality control and customer satisfaction.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including inadequate legal basis, lack of transparency, unauthorized processing of special categories of data, and insufficient safeguards for automated processing."
"A Twitter user notified the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA) of an email she had received from the Belgian National Railway (NMBS) about the ""Hello Belgium Railway Pass"", which is a ticket for Belgian residents providing them with a number of free train rides. After having reviewed the facts provided by the Twitter user, the DPA decided to initiate an investigation into the incident on its own motion. In its investigations, the DPA found that the email contained the general terms and conditions of the NMBS, instructions on how to use the railway pass correctly and Covid related information. However, the communication also included information of promotional nature and no unsubscribe button or link was provided. In the proceedings, the controller brought forward that the email was intended to remind the recipients to always ensure their safety when traveling and to remind them of the contractual conditions. It, therefore, considered the email as necessary for the performance of the contracts concluded with the ticket holders under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 21","1. The case involves the Belgian National Railway (NMBS) as a data controller and a data subject (the Twitter user) who received an unsolicited email containing promotional content without an unsubscribe option, as investigated by the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA).

2. The controller (NMBS) claimed the email was necessary for contract performance under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, arguing it contained contractual terms and safety instructions. However, the email also contained promotional material, which extends beyond what is strictly necessary for contract performance or execution (Article 6(1)(b)), as promotional content serves marketing purposes rather than contractual obligations.

3. The inclusion of promotional material without a valid legal basis violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. For marketing communications, controllers must either obtain consent under Article 6(1)(a) or rely on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f), but neither was properly established here.

4. The absence of an unsubscribe mechanism violates Article 7(3) GDPR, which requires that withdrawal of consent must be as easy as giving it, and Article 21 GDPR, which grants data subjects the right to object to processing for direct marketing at any time. Controllers must explicitly offer this option in marketing communications per Article 21(4).

5. The controller's failure to provide a means to opt out of marketing communications infringes the data subject's rights under Articles 7(3) and 21 GDPR, and violates the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as data subjects were not adequately informed of their rights or given a clear way to exercise them.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, as the processing lacked a proper legal basis for the promotional content and failed to respect data subject rights regarding marketing objections and consent withdrawal."
"The controller - LORIS FUEL SHOP SRL - is a gas station. The data subject complained to the ANSPDCP (Romania) that images of him taken by a video surveillance system installed in the controller's gas station were published on Facebook without his consent. In its investigation of the incident, the ANSPDCP found that the controller did not sufficiently train its employees to handle personal data captured by the video surveillance system which let to third parties viewing and filming the images of the video cameras.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 29, Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves LORIS FUEL SHOP SRL as the controller processing personal data through video surveillance, which falls under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) as it captures images of identifiable natural persons.

2. The controller published images of the data subject on Facebook without consent, violating Article 6(1)(a) which requires processing to be lawful only if the data subject has given consent for specific purposes, and Article 5(1)(a) which mandates that processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent.

3. The investigation found insufficient employee training regarding handling personal data from the video surveillance system, violating Article 32(1) which requires controllers to implement appropriate organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including training of staff involved in processing operations.

4. The unauthorized disclosure of video footage to third parties (via Facebook) constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), and the controller failed to implement adequate safeguards to prevent such disclosure, violating the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f).

5. The controller's failure to protect the data subject's images from being viewed and filmed by third parties demonstrates non-compliance with Article 24(1), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"After receiving several marketing communications via SMS without offering their consent, a number of data subjects filed a series of complaints with the Romanian DPA against the controller Megareduceri TV S.R.L.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a controller (Megareduceri TV S.R.L.) sending marketing communications via SMS to data subjects without their consent, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. Article 6(1) requires that processing be lawful only if at least one legal basis applies. For marketing communications, the appropriate basis would typically be consent under Article 6(1)(a) or legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f), but the latter is subject to the data subject's right to object under Article 21.

3. The case specifically states that consent was not offered by the data subjects, meaning the controller lacked a valid legal basis under Article 6(1)(a) for the processing (sending marketing SMS).

4. Article 21(2) gives data subjects the right to object at any time to processing for direct marketing purposes, and upon objection, the personal data must no longer be processed for such purposes.

5. The controller's actions in sending multiple marketing communications without prior consent and continuing after complaints indicates a violation of both the consent requirements under Article 6(1)(a) and the right to object under Article 21(2).

6. Article 5(1)(a) requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Sending unsolicited marketing messages without consent violates this principle.

7. The complaints filed with the Romanian DPA demonstrate that data subjects exercised their right under Article 77 to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, which is appropriate when they consider that processing infringes the GDPR.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to the controller's processing of personal data for marketing purposes without a valid legal basis and in violation of data subjects' rights."
"After the controller Concordia Capital IFN S.A. installed surveillance cameras inside its offices, its employees filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves Concordia Capital IFN S.A. (controller) processing personal data of its employees through surveillance cameras inside its offices, which falls under the definition of processing personal data as per Article 4 of the GDPR.

2. The processing must comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a). The installation of surveillance cameras in workplaces requires a lawful basis under Article 6, such as consent or legitimate interests, and must adhere to specific safeguards for employee data processing under Article 88.

3. For processing to be lawful based on consent under Article 6(1)(a), it must meet the conditions in Article 7, including being freely given. Given the power imbalance in employment relationships, consent is unlikely to be freely given, as indicated in Recital 43, which states that consent is not freely given if there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and controller.

4. Article 88 requires Member States to provide more specific rules for processing employee data, including ensuring transparency and safeguarding rights. The Romanian DPA likely has guidelines requiring explicit information and consultation with employees before implementing surveillance, which Concordia Capital may not have followed, leading to the complaint.

5. The controller must provide information to data subjects under Articles 13 and 14. Employees must be informed about the processing, including the purposes and legal basis, as per Article 13(1)(c). Failure to adequately inform employees before installing cameras violates transparency obligations.

6. The complaint to the Romanian DPA suggests that employees were not properly informed or that the processing lacked a lawful basis, violating Articles 5 and 6. The DPA's finding of noncompliance indicates that Concordia Capital did not meet the required standards for lawful processing of employee data under the GDPR.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) (the controller) received a request for access to documents from a journalist regarding information collected via its whistleblower scheme. On 31 May 2020, the FSA complied with the request under The Public Access to Information Act after removing the identifiable personal data relating to the reporting individuals. On 6 June 2020, one of the whistleblowers complained with the FSA that the journalist contacted them by email. The FSA investigated the matter and learned that, due to a software feature, it was possible to unredact the blackened parts and extract the supposedly anonymised information. After learning about the data breach, the Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) assessed whether the controller implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) as the data controller processing personal data through its whistleblower scheme, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach when supposedly anonymized information became identifiable due to a software feature allowing unredaction, constituting unauthorized disclosure of personal data under the definition of ""personal data breach"" in Article 4(12).

3. Under Article 32(1), the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized disclosure. The failure of the redaction method demonstrates inadequate technical measures were implemented.

4. Article 5(1)(f) requires processing with appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing, which was violated when the journalist could access identifiable whistleblower information through the flawed redaction technique.

5. Following discovery of the breach, the controller was required under Article 33(1) to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay and within 72 hours unless the breach was unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. The case does not indicate proper notification occurred.

6. Since the breach resulted in a journalist contacting a whistleblower, it likely presented a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, triggering the obligation under Article 34(1) to communicate the breach to affected data subjects without undue delay, which was not done.

7. The controller violated the accountability principle in Article 5(2) by failing to demonstrate implementation of appropriate technical measures (such as proper redaction methods) to ensure compliance with the security principle.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to failures in implementing appropriate security measures, properly handling the personal data breach, and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of personal data as required by multiple articles including Articles 5, 32, 33, and 34."
"A former employee lodged a complaint with the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) about the unlawful forwarding of and access to their email inbox after they had left a company. The data subject had objected to the processing, but the controller had declined to sufficiently assess their objection, or to stop the processing.

The DPA's investigation revealed that the controller had not actually enabled automatic forwarding of the data subject's particular email address. They had also deleted the data subject's inbox shortly after they had left the company. Thus, the controller argued that they had not accessed the data subject's emails in any way.

However, in 2018 the company had enabled functionality that would retrieve and forward emails with certain keywords sent to non-registered email addresses belonging to their domain, to one collective inbox. The reason for this was evidently that a customer had once sent an email to an incorrect address and this functionality could mitigate the risk of not receiving customer emails. This also meant that even though the controller had deleted the data subject's inbox, emails sent to their address could still be routed to the company's collective inbox. This had happened once, according to the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (emails) by a controller (the company) after a data subject (former employee) had left the company, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means.

2. The controller implemented a system that automatically forwarded emails containing certain keywords from non-registered email addresses (including the data subject's former address) to a collective inbox, constituting processing of personal data under Article 4(2), without establishing a valid legal basis under Article 6(1). While the controller claimed legitimate interests (customer service), they failed to properly balance these against the data subject's fundamental rights, especially after the data subject's explicit objection.

3. The data subject exercised their right to object to processing under Article 21(1), but the controller failed to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that overrode the data subject's interests, rights, and freedoms, as required by Article 21(1). The controller's insufficient assessment of the objection constitutes a violation of Article 21.

4. The processing violated the principle of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), as emails intended for the data subject were repurposed for general customer service without the data subject's knowledge or consent, and without a clear legal basis compatible with the original purpose.

5. The controller failed to provide transparent information about this processing activity to data subjects as required under Articles 13 and 14, particularly regarding the automated forwarding of emails from inactive accounts to a collective inbox, which deprived data subjects of meaningful information about how their personal data was being processed.

6. The storage of forwarded emails in a collective inbox without defined retention periods or clear purpose specification likely violated the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e)), as personal data was kept in a manner that permitted identification for longer than necessary.

7. The controller's failure to properly respond to the data subject's objection and cease processing where no overriding legitimate grounds were demonstrated constitutes a violation of the data subject's rights under Chapter III (Articles 12-22) and the general principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"In 2018, the AEPD (Spain) received a complaint which raised doubts about whether Google LLC (controller) was handling requests to remove content in a legally correct manner. The complaint asserted that Google LLC, which is based in Mountain View California USA, was unlawfully sending copies of removal requests by users to a third party (the “Lumen Project”). This triggered a broader investigation of the AEPD into the way how Google handles removal requests and the right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR. In its investigation the AEPD found that Google provides a webpage named “Removing Content From Google” where a user can request the removal of content from the various Google services (33 at the time of writing). In the first step, the user had to select the particular Google service it wanted data to be removed from. In the second step, the user had to choose between predefined grounds for the request. Among these predefined grounds (which specific grounds are listed depends on the selected service in step one) are e.g. defamation, copyright infringement, harassment and personal information. The AEPD took special notice of some of these predefined grounds: e.g. when having selected “Google Search”, a user had, among others, the following three options of predefined grounds: “Remove personal information from Google under product policies”, “Legal personal information issue: request removal of my personal information from Google’s search results”, “Other legal issue: report content for a legal reason not already listed”. The AEPD further established in its investigation that, only if the user selected the right predefined grounds, he or she was provided with the link to the web form “EU Privacy Removal”. This was the only form which Google treated as a request to erasure under Article 17 GDPR. Furthermore, Google did not provide a link to this form in its privacy policy but rather linked to the web page “Removing Content From Google”.

By looking at this system, the AEPD also found – as the complaint asserted – that Google was sending removal requests, except the ones made under Article 17 GDPR, to the “Lumen Project”. The Lumen Project is a project of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society of the Harvard University which is collecting removal requests from different providers in a publicly accessible database. A typical entry in the database contains a summary of the request and a link to the original content. Before the user submitted a request for removal on the page “Removing Content From Google” he or she was informed by a banner that a copy of the request may be sent to the Lumen project for publication and that Lumen will redact the personal information. However, the AEPD found that the automated redaction process implemented by the Lumen Project often did not work, leaving personal data included in the requests unredacted in the database.

At the start of the proceedings, the AEPD forwarded the complaint to the DPC (Ireland). After one year, the DPC decided that it did not consider itself competent to handle the complaint since Google LLC and not Google Ireland Ltd was the controller of the processing in question.

Google LLC notably argued in the proceedings that the AEPD violated the consistency mechanism because it forwarded the case to the DPC only at the beginning of the proceedings – where only a violation of Article 6 GDPR was alleged – but not after having broadened the investigation to include a violation of Article 17 GDPR. Furthermore, it argued that the transfer of the requests to the Lumen Project were lawful under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR since the Lumen Project pursues educational, research and transparency purposes with the database.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves Google LLC as the controller processing personal data removal requests, which falls under the scope of GDPR as it processes personal data of data subjects in the EU (Article 3).

2. Google's process for handling removal requests requires users to navigate through predefined grounds and only provides access to the GDPR erasure request form (""EU Privacy Removal"") if specific options are selected. This creates an obstacle for data subjects to exercise their right to erasure under Article 17, violating Article 12(2) which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.

3. Google's transfer of removal requests (except those made under Article 17) to the Lumen Project involves processing personal data without a valid legal basis. While Google claims legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f), the processing fails the balancing test as the fundamental rights of data subjects override Google's interests, especially given the inadequate redaction of personal data by Lumen.

4. The transfer to Lumen Project violates Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle) and Article 32 (security of processing) as the automated redaction process often failed, leaving personal data exposed in a publicly accessible database without appropriate technical measures.

5. Google's failure to directly provide the Article 17 request form in its privacy policy, instead linking to a general removal page, violates Article 12(1) which requires transparent information and communication in an easily accessible form.

6. Regarding supervisory authority competence: While Google argued the AEPD violated the consistency mechanism by not re-engaging the DPC after broadening the investigation, Article 56(1) establishes that the lead supervisory authority should be where the controller's main establishment is. However, since Google LLC is established outside the EU and the processing relates to monitoring behavior of EU data subjects (Article 3(2)), the AEPD had competence to handle the complaint under Article 55(1).

7. The cumulative violations of Articles 12, 17, 5, and 32 demonstrate systematic non-compliance with GDPR principles and obligations.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In February 2021, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) notified the Norwegian DPA Datatilsynet about a personal data breach where they had published CVs without a legal basis. The DPA had also received 18 complaints from data subjects regarding the incident.

NAV, the controller, has since 2001 had online solutions for making job applicants' CVs available for logged-in employers. In February 2019, they launched a new online tool where job applicants could voluntarily register their CVs. The controller, however, also made these available to employers through a candidate search, by default, including CVs where the data subjects had not given their consent. In addition, the controller had required data subjects to publish their CV to receive certain social services and benefits.

In 2020, a data subject contacted NAV's Data Protection Officer about the processing and, consequently, the controller launched an internal review. They concluded that they lacked a legal basis as per Article 6(1) GDPR for publishing the CVs, as far back as 2001. The controller had assessed legal bases in national laws pertaining to them, but found that these could not be relied upon for this particular situation. The controller now also realised that they did not either have a legal basis for requiring data subjects to publish their CV like this to receive certain social services and benefits.

The CVs contained information about data subjects' name, place of residence, date of birth, telephone number, e-mail address, education, work and other relevant experience, courses, driver's licenses, access to vehicles, various approvals and certifications, language, stated competencies and job wishes. This information is subject to confidentiality as per national regulations applicable to the controller.

The controller informed the DPA that 535,900 CVs was part of the 2019 system and they estimated that the maximum number of affected data subjects was 1,8 million. When the controller realized the breach, they notified the DPA and tried to inform every affected data subject personally by email or letter, as well as via their website.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) as a data controller processing personal data through their CV publication system, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2(1) as processing ""wholly or partly by automated means.""

2. The controller processed personal data including names, contact details, birth dates, education, work experience, and other sensitive information contained in CVs, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) as ""any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.""

3. The controller lacked a valid legal basis for processing this personal data, violating Article 6(1) which requires that processing be lawful only if based on at least one of the specified conditions (consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests). The controller explicitly concluded they had no legal basis under Article 6(1) for publishing the CVs.

4. The controller required data subjects to publish their CVs to receive certain social services and benefits, which constitutes making the provision of services conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for those services, violating Article 7(4) which states that ""utmost account shall be taken of whether [...] the performance of a contract [...] is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.""

5. The CVs contained information that may include special categories of personal data (such as health information, union membership, or other sensitive data), which requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or another specific exception under Article 9(2). The controller did not demonstrate compliance with these stricter requirements for special category data.

6. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, particularly by making CVs available to employers by default without the data subjects' explicit consent.

7. The controller processed personal data on a large scale (affecting up to 1.8 million data subjects) without conducting a proper Data Protection Impact Assessment as required by Article 35(1) for processing operations likely to result in high risk to rights and freedoms of data subjects.

8. The controller failed to ensure the security of processing as required by Article 32(1), as they published confidential personal data without adequate safeguards, despite national regulations classifying this information as subject to confidentiality.

9. The controller's actions violated the basic principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), and data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c)) by processing personal data without a valid legal basis, for purposes not properly specified, and collecting more data than necessary.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"An employee (the data subject) had quit their job and was supposed to assist the employer (the controller) during the notice period. However, due to disagreements, the controller blocked the data subject's access to email and business systems and enabled automatic forwarding of emails to the general manager of the company.

The data subject objected to this processing, but the controller upheld it for several weeks and only stopped it when the general manager realized it could be problematic. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) launched an investigation after receiving both a notification from the controller, as well as a complaint from the data subject.

The controller explained to the DPA that they had enabled automatic forwarding of the emails because the data subject had refused to enable an out of office reply. They further argued that this was necessary to uphold customer relations and daily operations, and because they had discovered that the data subject had violated work duties a few months earlier.

The controller also claimed that the data subject had consented to the processing, however this was denied by the data subject and the controller was unable to document their assertion.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (emails) by the employer (controller) regarding the employee (data subject), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means.

2. The controller enabled automatic forwarding of emails, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2), and the data subject objected to this processing under Article 21(1).

3. The controller claimed that the processing was based on consent under Article 6(1)(a), but pursuant to Article 7(1), the controller must be able to demonstrate that consent was given. Since the controller could not document consent, the consent basis is invalid.

4. Alternatively, if the controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f), Article 21(1) requires that upon objection, the controller must no longer process the personal data unless compelling legitimate grounds are demonstrated that override the data subject's interests, rights, and freedoms. The controller argued necessity for customer relations and daily operations but failed to demonstrate such compelling grounds promptly and continued processing for several weeks after objection, violating Article 21(1).

5. The controller's actions, including blocking access and forwarding emails without a lawful basis after objection, also contravene the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The case concerned a group of Italian hospitals ""Azienda ospedaliera di Perugia"" (the controller), a provider of web applications ""ISWEB S.p.A."" (processor), and a host service provider ""Seeweb S.r.l."" (sub-processor). ISWEB provided a web application to the hospitals for collecting and managing employees’ whistleblowing reports. ISWEB contracted the company Seeweb for hosting the whistleblowing application. ISWEB neither obtained the prior written authorisation from the controller for engaging a sub-data processor, nor formalised its processor-sub-processor relationship with Seeweb through a contract or other legal act.

ISWEB claimed that the object of its contract with the hospitals was not the processing of whistleblower reports but the provision of technological infrastructure. ISWEB argued that neither itself nor Seeweb processed additional data which, associated with IP addresses, would allow users who accessed the whistleblower platform to be identified or made identifiable. That was because the whistleblower reports were encrypted with a key exclusively available to the hospitals. Therefore, ISWEB claimed that it was not required to obtain specific or general authorisation from the hospitals nor contractually impose the same data protection guarantees on Seeweb as imposed by its own relationship with the hospitals.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 28,"1. The case involves a controller (Azienda ospedaliera di Perugia), a processor (ISWEB S.p.A.), and a sub-processor (Seeweb S.r.l.) processing personal data through a whistleblowing application, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2.

2. Under Article 28(2), a processor may not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation from the controller. ISWEB engaged Seeweb as a sub-processor without obtaining such authorisation from the hospitals, constituting a violation.

3. Article 28(3) requires that processing by a processor be governed by a contract or other legal act that stipulates specific data protection obligations, including that the processor processes data only on documented instructions from the controller and ensures that persons authorised to process data are committed to confidentiality.

4. ISWEB failed to formalise its relationship with Seeweb through a contract or legal act that imposed the same data protection obligations as required under Article 28(3) and Article 28(4), which mandates that where a processor engages another processor, the same data protection obligations must be imposed on that sub-processor.

5. ISWEB's claim that it provided only technological infrastructure and did not process identifiable data due to encryption does not exempt it from the obligations under Article 28, as the hosting of personal data (even if encrypted) constitutes processing under Article 4(2), and the contractual and authorisation requirements apply irrespective of the encryption measures in place.

6. Article 28(4) further specifies that the initial processor (ISWEB) remains fully liable to the controller for the performance of the sub-processor's (Seeweb) obligations, and the lack of a contract and authorisation compounds this liability.

7. The case demonstrates failures in compliance with multiple provisions of Article 28, including the lack of prior authorisation, absence of a binding contract with the sub-processor, and failure to ensure equivalent data protection obligations are imposed on the sub-processor.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 16 January 2019, the Executive-committee of the Belgian DPA (GBA) started an investigation on the use of cookies on Belgian media websites. The controller in this case is Roularta Media Group.

The investigation revealed the following potential violations. First, the placement of unnecessary cookies prior to consent of the data subject. Second, the placement of statistical cookies without consent. Third, pre-ticked boxes to grant consent for cookies from partners. Fourth, the placement of a disclaimer for third-party cookies. Fifth, false and inadequate information in their privacy policy. Sixth, unjustified retention periods for the storage of cookies. Lastly, revoking consent was impossible. In fact, this placed more cookies. The controller argued that statistical cookies are used for aggregated basic statistics, necessary for the business model of the website. No personal data is being processed for this activity, as such, the GDPR does not apply.

The controller argued that regarding the statistical cookies, the personal data was anonymised. The controller further argued that the Belgian DPA did not provide adequate guidelines for companies to comply with the GDPR. The controller refers to e.g. the French and Dutch DPA, who have provided this.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 24","1. The case involves Roularta Media Group as the controller processing personal data through cookies on Belgian media websites, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The controller argued that statistical cookies process anonymized data and thus the GDPR does not apply. However, Recital 26 of the GDPR (which provides context to Article 4's definition of personal data) states that anonymized data, where identification is no longer possible, is not subject to the GDPR. Yet, the burden of proof lies with the controller to demonstrate that the data is truly anonymous and cannot be re-identified. The controller's claim without evidence does not exempt them from GDPR obligations.

3. The investigation found that unnecessary cookies were placed prior to consent. Article 5(1)(a) requires processing to be lawful, fair, and transparent. Placing cookies before obtaining consent violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 6(1)(a), which requires consent for processing, and the principle of fairness.

4. Statistical cookies were placed without consent. Even if argued as anonymized, if any personal data is processed before anonymization, consent is required. Moreover, the ePrivacy Directive (which complements GDPR for electronic communications) requires prior consent for non-essential cookies, which includes statistical cookies not necessary for the service.

5. Pre-ticked boxes were used to grant consent for cookies from partners. Article 4(11) defines consent as a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication. Article 7(1) requires demonstrating consent, and Recital 32 explicitly states that pre-ticked boxes do not constitute valid consent.

6. The placement of a disclaimer for third-party cookies is insufficient. Articles 13 and 14 require transparent information to be provided to data subjects, including the identity of controllers, purposes, and legal basis. A disclaimer does not meet the standards of clear and plain language required by Article 12(1).

7. False and inadequate information in the privacy policy violates Article 12(1) and Articles 13-14, which mandate accurate and comprehensive information to ensure fair and transparent processing.

8. Unjustified retention periods for cookies breach the storage limitation principle in Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in an identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes.

9. Making it impossible to revoke consent and placing more cookies upon revocation violates Article 7(3), which grants the data subject the right to withdraw consent at any time, and it must be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.

10. The controller's argument that the Belgian DPA did not provide adequate guidelines is not a valid defense, as the GDPR is directly applicable and imposes direct obligations on controllers under Article 24 to implement appropriate measures to ensure compliance, regardless of national guidelines.

11. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations of consent requirements, transparency obligations, data minimization, storage limitation, and the right to withdraw consent."
"The controller is the Italian administration that manages insurances for work injuries (INAIL). INAIL uses “Sportello Virtuale Lavoratori” (SVL), a platform that allows employees access their files and ongoing procedures before INAIL. The data subjects are the users of SVL.

The decision includes three separate data breaches, where users of SVL saw personal data of other users instead of their own after logging in. In total, 10 data subjects' personal data was disclosed to unauthorised third parties. On one occasion, the user was even able to download other data subjects’ personal data. In another instance the data subjects were deemed not identifiable, as it did not include their name.

INAIL suspended SVL after the first data breach. INAIL also implemented new technical and organisational measures. However, they did not prevent the next data breaches. Moreover, the cause of the first breach was not identified. INAIL claimed that it could be caused by a malfunction of software provided by third parties over which INAIL has no control.

INAIL argued that the data breaches were related to exceptional circumstances, unpredictable. INAIL further argued that the third data breach was caused by a mere human error. They should therefore not be deemed as indicator of non-adequate security measures.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 32","1. The case involves INAIL as the data controller processing personal data of employees through the SVL platform, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The data breaches described, where users accessed other users' personal data, constitute personal data breaches under Article 4(12), as they involve unauthorized disclosure of and access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.

3. Under Article 5(1)(f), personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The repeated breaches demonstrate that INAIL failed to implement adequate security measures to prevent such incidents.

4. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. INAIL's measures were insufficient, as evidenced by three separate breaches occurring even after initial remedial actions were taken.

5. Article 24 mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. INAIL's inability to prevent recurring breaches and failure to identify the root cause of the first breach indicate a lack of effective measures and accountability.

6. Under Article 28, controllers using processors (such as third-party software providers) remain responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure processing meets GDPR requirements. INAIL's claim that the breach was caused by third-party software does not absolve them of responsibility.

7. Article 33 requires controllers to notify personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay and within 72 hours of becoming aware, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. The case does not mention notification, but the breaches involved unauthorized access to personal data, which likely posed risks requiring notification.

8. The argument that breaches were due to exceptional circumstances or human error is not valid under GDPR, as Article 32 explicitly requires controllers to account for such risks and implement measures to prevent them, including through regular testing and evaluation of effectiveness.

9. The disclosure of personal data, including instances where data could be downloaded, violates the confidentiality and integrity principles of Article 5(1)(f) and the security obligations under Article 32, particularly as sensitive data related to health and injuries may have been involved, necessitating higher safeguards under Article 9.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller is the Municipality of Taranto. The processor is Amiu s.p.a., a public entity facilitating waste collection services for the Municipality of Taranto. A report from the DPA revealed that the processor installed video surveillance systems to detect and sanction illegal activities. Some of these videos showing identifiable persons were posted on its Facebook page. On 14 January 2020, the processor contacted the supplier of the video surveillance system (ITS) without notifying the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 28, Article 37, Article 57","1. The case involves the Municipality of Taranto as the controller and Amiu s.p.a. as the processor, which falls under the definitions provided in Article 4 of the policy, where a controller determines the purposes and means of processing, and a processor processes data on behalf of the controller.

2. The processor (Amiu s.p.a.) installed video surveillance systems and posted videos containing identifiable persons on its Facebook page without documented instructions from the controller (Municipality of Taranto), violating Article 28(3)(a), which requires that the processor processes personal data only on documented instructions from the controller.

3. The posting of videos containing identifiable persons on Facebook constitutes processing of personal data without a lawful basis under Article 6, as there is no indication that consent was obtained or that another legal basis applies, and it likely infringes on the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

4. The processor contacted the supplier (ITS) of the video surveillance system without prior authorization from the controller, which violates Article 28(2), which states that the processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller.

5. The processing of personal data through video surveillance and public posting on social media may involve special categories of data under Article 9 (e.g., biometric data) without meeting any of the exceptions, such as explicit consent or substantial public interest, further compounding the violation.

6. The controller (Municipality of Taranto) failed to ensure that the processor provided sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures as required by Article 28(1), leading to unauthorized processing and disclosure of personal data.

7. The case demonstrates a lack of adherence to the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles, which includes ensuring processor compliance.

The certificate also included information on the procedure and legal basis for the termination of the employment relationship as well as on attachment of earnings. The controller did not notify the DPA of the data breach.

When the data breach was discovered by the DPA in the course of an investigation, the controller reasoned that it did not notify the DPA because the data breach did not entail a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The controller further stated that it had notified the data subject of the loss of his employment certificate and he did not make any claims against the company in this respect. Hence, the controller argued that it did not violate Article 33(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 33,"1. The case involves Esselmann Technika Pojazdowa Sp. z o.o. Sp. k. (the controller) which lost an employee's employment certificate containing personal data including name, surname, place of residence, date of birth, and sensitive information about employment termination and attachment of earnings (Article 4 definitions of 'personal data').

2. According to Article 33(1), the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. The controller argued the breach didn't require notification because it believed there was no risk to the data subject's rights and freedoms, noting the employee was informed and made no claims. However, the lost data included identifiers that could facilitate identity theft or fraud (name, address, birth date) and sensitive employment/financial information (termination details, attachment of earnings), creating a potential risk to the data subject's rights and freedoms.

4. Article 33(1) places the burden on the controller to properly assess risk, and the exception applies only when the breach is ""unlikely"" to result in risk. The nature of the lost data makes risk likely, so the controller should have notified the DPA.

5. The controller's failure to notify constitutes a violation of Article 33(1), regardless of the employee's subsequent response, as the notification obligation is triggered by the breach itself and the controller's risk assessment.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 16 January 2019, the executive-committee of the Belgian DPA (GBA) started an investigation on the placement of cookies on Belgian media websites. The controller is Rossel & Cie, the owner of the websites of Le Soir, Sudinfo and Sudpresse éditions digitales. The investigation revealed the following potential violations.

First of all, the placement of cookies that were not strictly necessary - including statistical and social-network cookies - prior to consent of the data subject. The controller does not dispute this. However, it argues that the method used for the investigation was not reliable to establish a violation. Furthermore, that the statistical cookies placed do not require prior consent. As for the social-network cookies, the controller argued that it had a legitimate interest for the processing activities.

Second, the qualification of 'further browsing' as consent. The cookie-banner disappears if the user continues scrolling on the website. The controller argues that this is active behaviour that meets the active consent requirement of Planet 49.

Third, pre-ticked boxes to grant consent for third-party-cookies.

Forth, an incomplete and poorly accessible cookie policy.

Sixth, unjustified retention periods for the storage of cookies.

Lastly, revoking consent was impossible.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14","1. The case involves the processing of personal data through the placement of cookies on websites operated by Rossel & Cie, which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, making it subject to the regulation's requirements.

2. The controller placed statistical and social-network cookies without prior consent. According to Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC), which is implemented in national law and complements the GDPR, the storage of or access to information on a user's terminal equipment requires prior consent, except for strictly necessary cookies. Since statistical and social-network cookies are not strictly necessary, prior consent is required under Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR, making their placement without consent a violation.

3. The controller's argument that ""further browsing"" (scrolling) constitutes valid consent is invalid. The GDPR requires consent to be a clear affirmative act under Article 4(11), and the Court of Justice of the European Union in Planet49 (C-673/17) explicitly ruled that scrolling does not constitute active consent. This violates the requirement for unambiguous consent under Articles 4(11) and 7(1).

4. The use of pre-ticked boxes for third-party cookies is explicitly invalid as a form of consent. The Planet49 judgment confirmed that pre-ticked boxes do not constitute valid consent under Article 4(11) and Recital 32, as consent must be actively given.

5. The incomplete and poorly accessible cookie policy violates the transparency principles under Articles 12(1) and 13 of the GDPR, which require that information provided to data subjects be concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible, and in clear and plain language.

6. Unjustified retention periods for cookies violate the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, which requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.

7. The impossibility to revoke consent violates Article 7(3) of the GDPR, which stipulates that the data subject shall have the right to withdraw consent at any time, and it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In 2021, a data subject lodged a complaint with the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) against ""Shinigami Eyes"" after they had been marked through the application. Shinigami Eyes is a browser addon that highlights transphobic and trans-friendly social network pages and users with different colors.

Consequently, the DPA launched an investigation and sent a request for information to the developer of the extension, who failed to reply. The DPA sent several requests and reminders and, finally, an advance notification of a decision, but the developer never replied back. The data subject, however, provided further comments to the complaint and, following this, the DPA found that they had enough information to be able to issue a final decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 6, Article 12, Article 14","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the ""Shinigami Eyes"" browser extension, which marks users based on their perceived stance on transgender issues, making the developer a data controller under Article 4 of the GDPR (defining 'controller' as the entity determining purposes/means of processing).

2. The developer failed to respond to multiple information requests from the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet), violating Article 31, which requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request.

3. The processing likely involves special category data (e.g., political opinions, philosophical beliefs) under Article 9(1), as categorizing users as ""transphobic"" or ""trans-friendly"" implies assessment of personal views. No lawful exception under Article 9(2) appears applicable, particularly since explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) was not obtained from data subjects.

4. The developer failed to provide transparent information to data subjects about the processing (e.g., purposes, legal basis, categories of data) as required under Articles 13 (where data collected from subject) or 14 (where not collected from subject), violating the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

5. The data subject's right to access information under Article 15 (including categories of data processed and recipients) was likely impeded due to the developer's non-cooperation, further violating Chapter III rights.

6. The developer's failure to engage with the DPA also obstructs the supervisory authority's investigative powers under Article 58(1)(e-f) (right to access data and premises), compounding the non-compliance.

7. The absence of demonstrated lawful basis for processing (e.g., consent under Article 6(1)(a) or legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f)) violates the core principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

8. The processing may involve profiling (automated evaluation of personal aspects) under Article 4(4), yet no safeguards under Article 22 (e.g., right to human intervention) were implemented or communicated.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations including lack of lawful basis for processing special category data, failure to cooperate with supervisory authorities, and infringement of transparency and data subject rights."
"The controller, a private entity, operated as a SARS-CoV-19 test station. The legal basis for the processing of personal data of individuals for the purpose of carrying out SARS-CoV-2 self-testing procedures is Article 6(1)(c) GDPR (the necessity to comply with a legal obligation) and Article 9(2)(h) GDPR, in conjunction with Article 14c of the Act on Databases in the Field of Healthcare (Zakon o zbirkah podatkov s področja zdravstvenega varstva - ZZPPZ).

While a contractual relationship existed between the data subject and the the person ordering the testing, the ZZPPZ establishes the obligation to transfer the data to the Central Register of Patients' Data (CRPP) for the purpose of carrying out the testing for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to Article 14č of the ZZPPZ, the information shall be transferred to the CRPP as soon as it arises or is received in the course of the provision of health care, but at the latest by the end of the working day.

The data subjects were not aware of these data transfers.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13","1. The controller, a private entity operating a SARS-CoV-19 test station, processes personal data, including health data (SARS-CoV-2 test results), which qualifies as special category data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR.
2. The legal basis for processing is cited as Article 6(1)(c) (necessity to comply with a legal obligation) and Article 9(2)(h) (processing for health purposes), in conjunction with national law (ZZPPZ Article 14c), which may be valid for the lawfulness of processing itself.
3. However, under Article 13 of the GDPR, when personal data is collected directly from the data subject (as in this case during testing), the controller must provide specific information at the time of data collection, including the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, as per Article 13(1)(e).
4. The case states that data is transferred to the Central Register of Patients' Data (CRPP) as required by ZZPPZ Article 14c, but the data subjects were not aware of these transfers, indicating that the controller failed to provide this information.
5. This failure to inform data subjects about the transfer of their data to CRPP violates Article 13(1)(e) of the GDPR, which mandates disclosure of recipients.
6. Additionally, Article 12 of the GDPR requires that information be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, which was not done here, further violating transparency obligations.
7. There are no applicable exemptions under Article 13(4) (where the data subject already has the information) or other provisions that would absolve the controller from this obligation, as the data subjects were unaware.
8. Even though processing may be based on a legal obligation, the information requirements under Articles 12 and 13 are independent and must be fulfilled to ensure fair and transparent processing.
9. Therefore, the controller's failure to provide required information to data subjects about data transfers constitutes a violation of the GDPR.

"SC Interactions Marketing SRL is a company providing Customer-Relationship-Management (CRM), marketing and digital services (processor). While promoting a marketing campaign on behalf of another company (controller), SC Interactions Marketing SRL sent a marketing email to 27 data subjects without hiding the email addresses of the recipients. This way, each recipient of the marketing email had unauthorised access to the email addresses of the other recipients. Following a complaint filled by one of the affected data subjects, the Romanian DPA started an investigation into the matter. During the investigation, the DPA found that the processor did not take the necessary technical and organisational measures to ensure the confidentiality of the personal data processed.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves SC Interactions Marketing SRL acting as a processor under Article 4(8), processing personal data (email addresses) on behalf of a controller during a marketing campaign.

2. The processor sent a marketing email to 27 data subjects without using blind carbon copy (BCC) or equivalent measures, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of all recipients' email addresses to each other, violating the confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f) which requires processing to ensure appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized disclosure.

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access to personal data. The processor failed to implement basic email security measures (e.g., BCC functionality) to prevent this disclosure.

4. As a processor under Article 28(1), SC Interactions Marketing SRL was obligated to provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to meet GDPR requirements. The investigation found they failed to implement such measures to ensure confidentiality.

5. The unauthorized disclosure of email addresses constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it involved accidental disclosure of personal data to unauthorized recipients.

6. The processor failed to comply with the security obligation under Article 32(2) to ensure that any natural person acting under their authority who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, as the disclosure was not authorized.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 28(1), and 32(1) of the GDPR."
"The controller is a building owners association which mandated a security company to ensure security and protection of their buildings (processor). The data subjects were couriers accessing the building complex of the controller. The investigation of the ANSPDCP  (Romania), which was initiated upon a complaint, revealed that the processor was collecting a big amount of personal data of the couriers on behalf of the controller. The processor was instructed by the controller to keep an access register of couriers entering the residential complex and note the following information there: name, surname, number of the ID card, destination, time of arrival, time of departure, observations. The DPA further found in its investigation that a video surveillance system was installed at the entrance of the building complex to monitor who is entering the complex and that the video footage captured by this surveillance system was stored longer than necessary.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a building owners association acting as a controller and a security company acting as a processor, as defined in Article 4(7) and (8), where the processor processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

2. The processor collected excessive personal data from couriers (name, surname, ID card number, destination, time of arrival/departure, and observations), which violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), which states that personal data must be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.""

3. The video surveillance footage was stored longer than necessary, violating the principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be ""kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.""

4. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation, as required by Article 24(1), particularly by instructing the processor to collect excessive data and failing to ensure proper storage periods for video footage.

5. The processor, while acting on the controller's instructions, processed personal data in a manner that infringed the Regulation, and under Article 28(3), the processor must only process data on documented instructions from the controller, but both parties share responsibility for ensuring compliance with GDPR principles.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller is Società Ospedale San Raffaele srl (a hospital). The data subjects are the patients of the hospital.

The controller notified the DPA of two data breaches. The email addresses of (1) 499 recipients of a newsletter from the Neurology Operative Unit and (2) 90 recipients of a newsletter from the Transplant and Metabolic-Bariatric Surgery unit in the CC instead of the BCC. This exposed the email addresses of all recipients to each other.

The controller stated that because of the limited scope of the violation, there is no concrete risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. It further argued 193 email addresses did not contain references to any names, so they were not personal data. The controller also stated that it happened due to a human error.

The controller adopted new technical and organisational measures to ensure data security. This included additional training, possible disciplinary sanctions against the person responsible and/or their superior and the establishment of a working group supervised by the DPO to implement these measures.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a controller (Società Ospedale San Raffaele srl) processing personal data of data subjects (patients) through email communications, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1), as the processing is carried out by automated means.

2. The email addresses of the recipients constitute personal data under Article 4(1), as they relate to identified or identifiable natural persons (patients), regardless of whether some addresses did not contain explicit names, since email addresses alone can directly or indirectly identify individuals.

3. The controller exposed these email addresses to all recipients by using the CC field instead of BCC, which constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it led to the unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

4. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure. The use of CC instead of BCC represents a failure in organizational measures and procedures to ensure the confidentiality of personal data.

5. The controller's argument that 193 email addresses did not contain references to names and were therefore not personal data is incorrect under Article 4(1), as email addresses are considered personal data when they relate to an identifiable natural person.

6. While the controller implemented post-breach measures (additional training, possible sanctions, and a DPO-supervised working group), these remedial actions do not negate the fact that appropriate measures were not in place at the time of the breach, as required by Article 32(1).

7. The breach notification to the DPA was made as required by Article 33(1), but the controller's assessment that there was ""no concrete risk"" contradicts the fundamental violation of confidentiality principles under Article 5(1)(f) and the specific security obligations under Article 32.

8. The human error causation does not absolve the controller of responsibility, as Article 24(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, including protection against human error through organizational measures.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle), Article 24(1) (responsibility of the controller), and Article 32(1) (security of processing)."
"During an inspection visit to Gyldendal A/S (controller), the Danish DPA found that information about approximately 685,000 unsubscribed members of Gyldendal's book clubs was kept for longer than needed. The controller stored data in a so-called ""passive database"" and had no procedures or guidelines for deleting it. Some of this information was kept for longer than ten years.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves Gyldendal A/S as a data controller processing personal data of approximately 685,000 unsubscribed book club members, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1) as processing by automated means.

2. The controller stored personal data in a ""passive database"" for periods exceeding ten years without established deletion procedures, violating the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form only for as long as necessary for the purposes of processing.

3. The lack of procedures or guidelines for data deletion constitutes a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 24(1), which requires controllers to implement measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, including storage limitation.

4. The prolonged retention of personal data without justification also violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the storage limitation requirement.

5. While Article 32 requires appropriate security measures, the core violation relates to the fundamental principles of storage limitation and accountability under Articles 5(1)(e) and 5(2), reinforced by the organizational measures requirement in Article 24.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e)), accountability principle (Article 5(2)), and requirement for implementing appropriate organizational measures (Article 24)."
"On 19 August 2021, the Northern Savonia Hospital District (controller) notified the Finnish Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman (DPA) about a security breach. The notification stated that the ""allow location data on this device"" function on employees' portable computers using Windows 10 was automatically enabled, and the employees couldn't change this setting.

The controller did not use this location data for any purpose and, after an internal investigation, considered that no personal information was sent to Microsoft. Finally, on 14 March 2022, the controller confirmed to the DPA that it disabled the location data function on the workstations.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 25,"1. The case involves the Northern Savonia Hospital District as a data controller processing personal data (location data of employees) under GDPR jurisdiction, as established in Article 4 definitions and Article 3 on territorial scope.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by default, as required by Article 25(2), which states that by default only personal data necessary for each specific purpose should be processed. Here, location data collection was automatically enabled without purpose limitation.

3. The controller violated Article 32(1) on security of processing, as they did not implement appropriate technical measures (e.g., disabling unnecessary location tracking) to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, given that location data can reveal sensitive information about employees' movements.

4. The automatic enabling of location data without a lawful basis violates Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation) and Article 6 (lawfulness of processing), as the controller admitted they had no purpose for this data collection.

5. Although the controller eventually disabled the function (March 2022), the breach persisted from at least August 2021 until then, indicating a failure to promptly address the vulnerability, contrary to Article 32(2) which requires steps to ensure ongoing confidentiality and integrity of processing systems.

6. The case demonstrates non-compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller failed to demonstrate proper implementation of data protection measures and timely remediation of identified risks.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A company selling furniture with its main establishment in France undertook an investigation by the French DPA. The investigation was performed both online and on-site. It revealed that the company had no data retention procedures in place, and that personal data was not regularly deleted or archived. The investigation also revealed that the company did not provide its customers with information about the legal basis for processing, nor about the data retention period. Lastly, the investigation revealed that customer accounts belonging to data subjects who had requested data erasure, had in fact not been deleted but instead simply deactivated.

The French DPA, acting as lead supervisory authority, sent a draft order to the other supervisory authorities involved. The Berlin supervisory authority objected in accordance with article 60(4) GDPR and requested that the draft order be turned into a draft penalty,  and more specifically an administrative fine. The furniture company contested this objection, arguing that the company had very few sales in Germany.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 60","1. The case involves a furniture company established in France processing personal data of customers across the EU, making it subject to GDPR regulations as per Article 3 (Territorial scope), since it is established in the Union and processes personal data in the context of its activities.

2. The investigation revealed the company had no data retention procedures, violating Article 5(1)(e) (Principles relating to processing), which requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.

3. The company failed to provide customers with information about the legal basis for processing and data retention period, violating Article 13(1)(c) and Article 13(2)(a) (Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject), which mandate that controllers must inform data subjects of both the legal basis for processing and the storage period/criteria at the time of data collection.

4. The company failed to properly erase customer accounts after data subjects requested erasure, violating Article 17(1) (Right to erasure), which requires controllers to erase personal data without undue delay when a data subject requests it under applicable grounds, and Article 19 (Notification obligation), which requires communicating such erasure to recipients.

5. The Berlin supervisory authority's objection under Article 60(4) is valid because:
   - The French DPA is the lead supervisory authority per Article 56(1)
   - The objection is ""relevant and reasoned"" as it requests appropriate corrective measures
   - The company's operations in Germany (even with few sales) still affect German data subjects, making the Berlin authority a ""concerned supervisory authority"" under Article 4(22)

6. The company's argument about having few sales in Germany does not exempt it from GDPR obligations, as Article 3(2) applies the Regulation to controllers not established in the Union who offer goods or services to data subjects in the Union, regardless of sales volume.

7. The violations constitute infringements of multiple GDPR provisions that could subject the company to administrative fines under Article 83(5) of up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover, particularly for violations of:
   - The basic principles for processing (Article 5)
   - Data subjects' rights (Articles 12-22)
   - Transparency requirements (Articles 12-14)

8. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA regarding the website of a football club. The DPA's investigation confirmed that controller's website required users to fill in forms with personal data but did not have a privacy policy.,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 83","1. The case involves a football club (controller) operating a website that requires users to fill in forms with personal data, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the policy.

2. Article 13 requires controllers to provide specific information to data subjects when personal data is collected directly from them, including: the identity and contact details of the controller (Article 13(1)(a)), purposes of processing (Article 13(1)(c)), legal basis for processing (Article 13(1)(c)), and other mandatory information listed in Articles 13(1)-13(2).

3. The investigation confirmed the website lacked a privacy policy, meaning the controller failed to provide any of the required information under Article 13 at the time of data collection.

4. Article 12(1) requires that information provided under Articles 13-14 be in a ""concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language,"" which cannot be satisfied without any privacy policy or notice.

5. The absence of a privacy policy also violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as data subjects cannot understand how their data will be processed.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1), and 13."
"The controller is E Software Concept SRL. The data subjects are its customers.

In May 2022, the Romanian DPA completed an investigation against the controller concerning a data breach.

The controller published several documents on their website, including client invoices and tracking numbers for the parcels sent to their clients. These documents disclosed the personal data of their clients, including names, surnames, delivery addresses, phone numbers, usernames, passwords and email addresses.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves E Software Concept SRL as the controller and its customers as data subjects, falling under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2, which applies to automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller published client invoices and tracking numbers on its website, disclosing personal data including names, delivery addresses, phone numbers, usernames, passwords, and email addresses without appropriate safeguards.

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires personal data to be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The public disclosure of sensitive personal data like passwords and addresses violates this integrity and confidentiality principle.

4. Article 32 mandates implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Publishing personal data on a website without access controls fails to meet this requirement.

5. Article 25 requires data protection by design and by default, ensuring only necessary personal data is processed. The controller exposed excessive personal data (including passwords) beyond what was necessary for invoice purposes.

6. Article 34 requires communication of personal data breaches to data subjects when likely to result in high risk. The exposure of credentials and contact information created high risks of identity theft and phishing, yet no evidence shows affected data subjects were notified.

7. The disclosure of passwords particularly violates Article 32(1)(a), which specifically references encryption as an appropriate security measure for sensitive data.

8. The public nature of the disclosure constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), defined as a breach leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

"S.C. Delivery Solutions S.A. (processor), commonly known as ""Sameday"", is a courier company. Sameday is authorized by two companies (controllers) for the processing of personal data.

The DPA received complaints about the processor's database, as it was found for sale on a website (RaidForums). Following the complaint, the DPA started an investigation.

The database contained the personal data of 26,566 customers (name of the recipient, contact details, address of the recipient, parcel details, delivery status etc.). The website was later seized by FBI, Europol and other European national police agencies.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 29, Article 32","1. The case involves S.C. Delivery Solutions S.A. (""Sameday"") acting as a processor authorized by two controllers for processing personal data, which falls under the scope of Article 28 of the GDPR policy regarding processor obligations.

2. The database containing personal data of 26,566 customers (including names, contact details, addresses, parcel details, and delivery status) was found for sale on RaidForums, indicating a personal data breach as defined in Article 4 of the GDPR policy ('personal data breach' means a breach of security leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data).

3. Under Article 32 of the GDPR policy, the processor must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The fact that the database was compromised and offered for sale demonstrates a failure to implement such measures.

4. According to Article 33 of the GDPR policy, the processor must notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. The case does not indicate that Sameday provided such notification to the controllers; instead, the breach was discovered through complaints to the DPA, suggesting a violation of this notification obligation.

5. Article 28(3) of the GDPR policy requires that processing by a processor be governed by a contract that stipulates the processor must process personal data only on documented instructions from the controller and implement appropriate security measures. The breach indicates a failure to comply with these contractual obligations.

6. The principles of processing under Article 5 of the GDPR policy, particularly the integrity and confidentiality principle (Article 5(1)(f)), require that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized disclosure. The sale of the database on RaidForums constitutes a clear violation of this principle.

7. As the processor, Sameday is directly liable under Article 82 of the GDPR policy for damages caused by processing that infringes the Regulation, particularly where it has not complied with obligations specifically directed to processors (Article 82(2)).

8. The investigation by the DPA and the subsequent finding of noncompliance further support that Sameday failed to meet its obligations under the GDPR policy, leading to a breach affecting a significant number of data subjects.

9. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."

The documents included the authorisation number, the data of the insured (name, surname, number of insurance policy) and the type of medical tests.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, including special categories of health-related data (medical test authorizations, names, insurance policy numbers), by an insurance company acting as a data controller, as defined in Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The insurance company repeatedly sent sensitive personal data via email to an unrelated third party (the woman) without any lawful basis, violating Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency) and Article 6 (lawfulness of processing), as no consent or other valid legal ground existed for this disclosure.

3. The data disclosed included special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (health-related information), which requires explicit consent or one of the specific exceptions under Article 9(2). The insurance company did not have explicit consent from the data subjects nor met any exception for processing this sensitive data, violating Article 9.

4. The insurance company failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security, as required by Article 32, leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data via email to incorrect recipients, constituting a personal data breach under Article 4(12).

6. The company failed to communicate the breach to the affected data subjects under Article 34, as the breach likely resulted in a high risk to their rights and freedoms (e.g., exposure of sensitive health information).

7. The insurance company did not respond effectively to the data subject's complaints (via the third party) or take measures to rectify the breach, violating Article 12 (transparent communication and facilitation of rights) and the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

8. The repeated nature of the incident indicates a systemic failure in data protection measures, violating the principles of data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A law firm was exposed to a hacker attack. Thereby, hackers received access to the firm's servers that contained personal data and encrypted them. This posed a serious risk that the personal data was accessed by unauthorized persons, with a potential for harm to the data subjects. In March 2020, the law firm notified the Danish DPA of the data breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 24, Article 32, Article 83","1. The case involves a law firm that experienced a hacker attack resulting in unauthorized access to servers containing personal data, which constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4 (12) of the GDPR.

2. Under Article 33 (1), the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. The case states the law firm notified the Danish DPA in March 2020, but does not specify when the breach was discovered or whether notification occurred within 72 hours of awareness, raising potential noncompliance with Article 33's timing requirements.

4. Article 33 (3) requires the breach notification to include specific information such as the nature of the breach, categories of data subjects affected, likely consequences, and measures taken. The case provides no evidence these details were included in the notification.

5. Under Article 34 (1), when the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to affected data subjects without undue delay.

6. The case explicitly states the breach ""posed a serious risk"" with ""potential for harm to the data subjects,"" indicating a high-risk scenario triggering Article 34's communication requirement, yet no evidence suggests such communication occurred.

7. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including encryption and regular security testing. The successful hacker attack and server encryption suggest potential insufficient security measures.

8. The law firm, as a controller processing special categories of data (likely including legal case details), had heightened obligations under Articles 9 and 32 to implement stricter safeguards, which appear inadequate given the breach.

9. Therefore, based on the apparent failures to: (a) potentially notify within 72 hours, (b) include required notification details, (c) communicate to data subjects despite high risk, and (d) implement adequate security measures, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A car insurance company (controller) designed a customer portal that enabled customers to access all documents related to their case, even those that they should not have been authorised to see. These roughly 340 documents sent by counterparties, witnesses and repair personnel contained personal data such as contact information, witness statements, payment information and at least one incident of a social security number.

The controller had performed a number of tests before implementing the system, however the relevant authorisation setting was not discovered during these tests as it was not considered a systemic flaw.

The insurance company reported the breach to the Danish DPA which consequently opened an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves a car insurance company acting as a data controller, processing personal data through a customer portal system, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach where approximately 340 documents containing personal data (including contact information, witness statements, payment information, and a social security number) were accessible to unauthorized users through the customer portal, constituting a breach of security leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures."" The controller failed to implement adequate security measures to prevent this unauthorized access.

4. Article 32(1) requires controllers to ""implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,"" including measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems. The authorization flaw in the customer portal system represents a failure to implement such measures.

5. Article 24(1) requires controllers to ""implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation."" The fact that testing did not discover the authorization flaw indicates insufficient measures to demonstrate compliance.

6. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons. While the controller reported the breach, the occurrence of the breach itself demonstrates prior non-compliance with security obligations.

7. The breach involved special categories of personal data (social security number) which requires enhanced protection under Article 9, yet the controller failed to implement adequate safeguards for this sensitive data.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to failures to implement appropriate security measures, ensure confidentiality of personal data, and demonstrate compliance with GDPR requirements."
"On 28 September 2021, Sports Connection ApS, a footwear distributor (the controller), notified the Danish DPA about unauthorized access to its webshop. The controller had become a victim of a hacker attack in which unauthorized persons gained access to the customers' payment information by inserting a code into the controller's webshop. The controller stated that the website was shut down immediately after discovering the data breach and the affected customers were notified on the same day.

The DPA opened an investigation following the notification of the data breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves a data breach at Sports Connection ApS where unauthorized persons gained access to customers' payment information by inserting malicious code into the controller's webshop, constituting a personal data breach under Article 4(12) of the policy.

2. According to Article 33(1), the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. The controller discovered the breach on September 28, 2021, but only notified the Danish DPA on October 1, 2021, which exceeds the 72-hour requirement stipulated in Article 33(1), demonstrating a failure to report the breach in a timely manner.

4. The breach involved payment information, which is sensitive personal data that could lead to financial fraud or identity theft, indicating a likely risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, thus requiring notification under Article 33(1).

5. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access to personal data. The successful hacker attack through code injection suggests insufficient security measures were in place.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to both the delayed breach notification violating Article 33(1) and the inadequate security measures violating Article 32."
"A1 Hrvatska d.o.o., a provider of telecommunications services (the controller), processed personal data of approximately 100,000 data subjects. These data were accessed by attackers. After the controller was made aware of the data breach, it notified both the DPA and the affected data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves A1 Hrvatska d.o.o., a telecommunications service provider, which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4 of the policy, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data for approximately 100,000 data subjects.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach where attackers accessed personal data, which constitutes a ""personal data breach"" as defined in Article 4, meaning a breach of security leading to unauthorized access to personal data.

3. Under Article 33(1), the controller is required to notify the supervisory authority (DPA) of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons. The case states the controller notified the DPA after becoming aware, but does not specify whether this was done within 72 hours or whether the breach was unlikely to result in risk.

4. Article 32 requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures such as encryption and pseudonymization. The fact that attackers were able to access the data suggests a failure to implement adequate security measures, violating Article 32.

5. Article 34 requires the controller to communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The controller notified the affected data subjects, indicating that the breach was likely high risk.

6. However, Article 34(3) states that communication to the data subject is not required if the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures that render the data unintelligible to unauthorized persons, such as encryption. The case does not mention any such measures, implying they were not in place, which is a violation of Article 32.

7. The breach itself and the ability of attackers to access personal data indicate a failure to comply with the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires processing in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to failures to implement appropriate security measures under Article 32, potentially delayed notification under Article 33, and unnecessary communication to data subjects without meeting the exceptions under Article 34, all stemming from inadequate data protection practices."
The Croatian DPA carried out an investigation over the processing of personal data by a car dealership in Zagreb (the controller). The controller used a video surveillance system on its premises.,NONCOMPLIANT,Article 27,"1. The case involves a car dealership in Zagreb (the controller) processing personal data through a video surveillance system on its premises, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller must have a lawful basis for processing personal data under Article 6(1). Video surveillance typically requires consent, legitimate interests, or another valid basis. The case does not mention any lawful basis being established, such as obtaining consent from data subjects or demonstrating legitimate interests that override data subjects' rights, which violates Article 6.

3. Article 5(1)(a) requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. The use of video surveillance without a lawful basis and without informing data subjects fails to meet the lawfulness and fairness principles.

4. Article 13 mandates that where personal data is collected from the data subject (as in video surveillance capturing individuals' images), the controller must provide specific information, including the identity of the controller, the purposes of processing, the legal basis, and other details. The case does not indicate that such information was provided to data subjects, violating transparency obligations.

5. Article 12 requires that the controller take appropriate measures to provide information referred to in Article 13 in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form. The absence of such measures, such as visible signage informing individuals about the surveillance, constitutes a violation.

6. Article 5(1)(c) enforces data minimization, meaning personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary. Video surveillance that captures more data than necessary (e.g., beyond security purposes) or without justification violates this principle.

7. The Croatian DPA's investigation found the controller noncompliant, indicating failures in adhering to the above articles, particularly regarding lawfulness, transparency, and data minimization.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Danish Health Data Authority (Sundhedsdatastyrelsen) is a controller for the Shared Medication Record (Fælles Medicinkort (FMK)), a national register that shares citizens' medication information across the healthcare system. The FMK is integrated with the healthcare professionals' local systems so they can see which medicine is registered for patients. Doctors can also add, change and remove drug prescriptions in the FMK via their local systems. A technical error occurred on one of the local systems which led to unintended changes in the FMK. The error meant that the removal of the dosage end date for 267 patients on the FMK did not make it through to the local system. The Health Data Authority became aware of the breach on 9 August 2021 but only reported it to the Danish Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) on 13 August 2021.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves the Danish Health Data Authority acting as a controller for processing personal data in the Shared Medication Record (FMK) system, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1) as processing ""wholly or partly by automated means.""

2. A personal data breach occurred when a technical error led to unintended changes in the FMK system, specifically affecting the dosage end dates for 267 patients. This constitutes a ""personal data breach"" as defined in Article 4(12) as ""a breach of security leading to the accidental... alteration... of personal data.""

3. According to Article 33(1), the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority ""without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it.""

4. The Health Data Authority became aware of the breach on 9 August 2021 but only reported it to the Danish Data Protection Authority on 13 August 2021. The time between awareness and notification exceeds 72 hours (approximately 96 hours), constituting a delay beyond the permitted timeframe.

5. Article 33(1) requires that where notification is not made within 72 hours, it ""shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay."" The case description does not indicate that any such reasons were provided, suggesting the delay was unjustified.

6. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the requirement to notify the breach without undue delay and within the 72-hour window as mandated by Article 33(1), with no evidence of providing reasons for the delay as required.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
The controller asked data subject to provide an email address so that contact could be made in the event of a product recall. The data subject asked for confirmation and guarantee about how their personal data would be used. The controller referred the data subject to the privacy policy on their website. The existence of processing personal data relating to a product recall was omitted from the privacy policy.,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 13","1. The controller collected personal data (email address) directly from the data subject for the specific purpose of contact in the event of a product recall, as described in the case.

2. Article 13 of the GDPR requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information at the time of data collection, including the purposes of the processing (Article 13(1)(c)) and other details such as the legal basis for processing, recipients of the data, and the rights of the data subject (Article 13(1) and (2)).

3. The controller did not provide this information directly at the time of data collection but instead referred the data subject to the privacy policy on their website.

4. The privacy policy omitted any mention of processing for product recall purposes, meaning it failed to include the required information about the purposes of processing as mandated by Article 13(1)(c).

5. Article 12 of the GDPR requires that information provided to data subjects be concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible (Article 12(1)). By having an incomplete privacy policy that does not disclose all processing purposes, the controller violated this transparency obligation.

6. The data subject explicitly asked for confirmation and guarantees about how their personal data would be used, indicating a request for information under GDPR rights. The controller's referral to an incomplete privacy policy did not fulfill the obligation to provide accurate and complete information, as required by Articles 12 and 13.

7. Therefore, the controller failed to comply with the GDPR's requirements for providing information to data subjects, specifically violating Articles 12 and 13.

8. Thus, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A commercial bank (controller) used personal data of current and former customers (data subjects) to identify customers with an affinity for digital media usage, in order to address them more intensely through electronic communication channels for further commercial communication (advertisement).

A service provider analyzed digital usage behavior on behalf of the controller, including the total amount of app-store purchases, the usage frequency of bank statement printers as well as the total amount of transfers in online banking system (in comparison to the offline usage in their local branch offices). The results were compared and further enriched with data from a commercial credit reporting agency. Most customers were informed in advance, but no consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR was obtained.

The controller based the data analysis, data enrichment and the subsequent creation of customer profiles on legitimate interest as per Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves a commercial bank as the controller processing personal data of current and former customers (data subjects) for profiling to identify digital media affinity for targeted advertising, based on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

2. Article 13 requires that when personal data is collected directly from data subjects, the controller must provide specific information, including the purposes of processing, legal basis, recipients of data, and the right to object, at the time of data collection. The case states that ""most customers were informed in advance,"" indicating that not all data subjects received this information, which violates Article 13.

3. Personal data was enriched with information from a commercial credit reporting agency, which means some data was not obtained directly from data subjects. Article 14 requires that when personal data is not obtained from the data subject, the controller must provide information about the source of the data and other details within a reasonable period. The case does not mention if this information was provided, potentially violating Article 14.

4. Article 21(1) requires that the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject at the latest at the time of the first communication, and it must be presented clearly and separately. The case does not indicate that this was done, violating Article 21.

5. The processing involves profiling for direct marketing purposes. While legitimate interest may be claimed under Article 6(1)(f), the controller must ensure that its interests are not overridden by the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The intensive profiling and data enrichment from third parties could be considered intrusive, and without proper information and objection rights, the balancing test under Article 6(1)(f) may not be satisfied, leading to a violation of the principle of lawfulness.

6. Therefore, due to violations of Article 13 (not all data subjects informed), Article 14 (potential lack of information for data from other sources), and Article 21 (right to object not properly communicated), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A company (the processor) performed test-drives for Volkswagen (the controller). With these test-drives, Volkswagen wanted to check if its driver assistance system worked well so that more traffic accidents could be prevented in the future. There were cameras attached to the test vehicle to, among others, record the surrounding traffic situation for the purpose of error analysis. The vehicle was stopped in 2019 by the Austrian police near Salzburg. Due to the cross-border processing of personal data, the DPA involved other concerned DPAs in the cooperation procedure under Article 60 GDPR before issuing a decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 28, Article 30, Article 35","1. The case involves Volkswagen as the controller and a company as the processor, with processing activities involving test-drives and video recording of surrounding traffic situations for error analysis (Article 4 definitions of controller and processor).

2. The processing involves capturing video footage of public traffic situations, which constitutes processing of personal data (e.g., vehicle identifiers, potentially facial images) under Article 4(1), as it relates to identifiable natural persons.

3. The processing purpose (error analysis for driver assistance systems) does not appear to fall under any of the exceptions in Article 9 for processing special categories of data, yet may involve biometric data (facial images) which requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or other specific exceptions.

4. The controller (Volkswagen) failed to establish a proper lawful basis under Article 6 for processing personal data of non-consenting individuals captured in public spaces, as:
   - Consent was not obtained from all data subjects (Article 6(1)(a))
   - The processing does not appear necessary for contract performance (Article 6(1)(b))
   - Legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) would require balancing test and safeguards that were not implemented

5. The controller violated transparency obligations under Articles 13 and 14 by not providing required information to data subjects whose personal data was collected through the video recordings.

6. The processor failed to ensure proper technical and organizational measures under Article 28 to comply with GDPR principles, particularly data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) as continuous video recording in public spaces exceeds what is necessary for the stated purpose.

7. The cross-border nature of processing triggered the cooperation procedure under Article 60, but this does not remedy the fundamental violations of basic processing principles and data subject rights.

8. The processing activities violated the core principles under Article 5, including:
   - Lawfulness, fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a))
   - Data minimization (Article 5(1)(c))
   - Purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b))

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The DPA became aware of the case after a report from Lolland Kommune, a Danish municipality, in December 2020, when an employee had their work phone stolen. The phone was not protected with an access code, because it had been manually disabled by the employee, and it could therefore be used to access the employee's work email account, which contained information on several citizens' names, social security numbers, health information and substance abuse.

The municipality informed the DPA that employees, for several years, could manually disable the otherwise mandatory access code. Following this incident, the municipality had immediately taken remedial action in the form of new precautions and changes in the technical set-up of new employee phones.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Lolland Kommune, a Danish municipality, which is a controller under GDPR as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data (Article 4(7)).

2. The controller processed personal data, including special categories of data such as health information and substance abuse, which are prohibited under Article 9(1) unless specific conditions apply, and require enhanced protection.

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

4. Article 32(1) mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

5. The risk was high due to the sensitivity of the data and the mobile nature of the device, necessitating robust security measures like access codes.

6. The controller failed to implement adequate technical measures by allowing employees to manually disable access codes on work phones for several years, violating Article 32(1) and Article 5(1)(f).

7. This failure resulted in a personal data breach when the unprotected phone was stolen, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data, as defined in Article 4(12).

8. Although the controller reported the breach to the DPA and took remedial action post-incident, the prior lack of security measures constitutes a violation of GDPR obligations under Articles 5 and 32.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) received a complaint from two data subjects who had been credit rated by a property management company they had no relationship with. The first data subject (data subject 1) recognized, however, the name of a person from the company, as he was the general manager for another company that her friend (data subject 2) had a rental agreement and dispute with. Both data subjects lodged complaints with the DPA and, consequently, the DPA launched an investigation.

The DPA unraveled that several companies were involved in the corporate structure, but mainly the case pertained to ""Krokatjønnveien 15 AS"" (company 1) and ""Bildøy Marina AS"" (company 2). The companies claimed they shared the subscription for and access to the credit rating system and that it, by accident, had conducted the credit ratings from the incorrect company 1. They also claimed they had policies and procedures for credit ratings in place. They failed, however, to sufficiently demonstrate and convince the DPA that this was indeed the case.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 24, Article 58","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (credit ratings) by companies (""Krokatjønnveien 15 AS"" and ""Bildøy Marina AS"") without a established relationship with the data subjects, which implicates GDPR principles under Article 5, including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.

2. The processing lacked a lawful basis under Article 6, as the companies could not demonstrate valid consent (Article 6(1)(a)) or legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) that override the data subjects' rights, since no relationship existed and the credit ratings were conducted accidentally from an incorrect company entity.

3. The companies failed to provide transparent information to the data subjects about the processing, as required by Articles 13 and 14, since the data subjects were unaware of the credit checks and the purposes behind them, violating the right to be informed.

4. The companies did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default under Article 25, as evidenced by their inability to prevent unauthorized credit checks from the wrong corporate entity despite claiming shared system access.

5. The right to access under Article 15 was infringed, as the data subjects discovered the processing indirectly through complaints rather than being informed by the controllers, undermining their ability to exercise their rights.

6. The companies failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2) and compliance with the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b),(c)), as credit ratings were conducted without a valid purpose or necessity.

7. The lack of evidence for policies and procedures for credit ratings violates Article 24, which requires controllers to implement measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR.

8. The case involves potential unauthorized processing of personal data related to financial behavior, which may constitute a breach of security obligations under Article 32, as the companies did not ensure proper access controls to prevent accidental processing.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations across Articles 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, and 32."
"The controller, Accor, is a large, multinational chain that operates hotels in 110 countries. Between December 2018 and September 2019, the French DPA (CNIL) received several complaints concerning the controller's various potential violations of the GDPR.

On 24 Feburary 2020, the CNIL conducted an investigation of the controller's website. Users supplied their contact information, including email address, when they registered an account with the controller. The registration process featured a pre-ticked box indicating consent to receive promotional materials. Data subjects subsequently started receiving these promotional materials in their inboxes. They were unable to unsubscribe from direct marketing emails, as various technical glitches prevented the emails' ""unsubscribe"" button from working. Several million people received these emails at valid addresses, though the CNIL's published decision redacted the exact amount.

Additionally, the website did not provide data subjects with information about the controller's contact details, the purposes of processing for the data collected, the legal basis for processing, the period for which the data would be retained, potential transfers, or the right to lodge a complaint under the GDPR, and there was no link to a privacy policy that might contain this information.

The CNIL also received one complaint regarding difficulties encountered exercising the right of access to personal banking data processed by the controller. The controller had failed to respond to an access request after locking a data subject's account for suspected fraudulent activity even after data subject verified their identity.

Finally, for the controller to access the ""Adobe Campaign"" account responsible for managing these email communications, a weak password consisting of seven capital letters and one special character was required, although access was only possible from a terminal connected to the ACCOR network.

Ten other supervisory authorities declared themselves to be concerned supervisory authorities, and the CNIL was also notified of five additional complaints by the supervisory authorities of Saarland, Spain, Ireland, Poland, and Lower Saxony. The controller's main establishment was determined to be in France, where more than half of its hotels were located. As such, the CNIL was the lead supervisory authority per Article 56(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 13, Article 15, Article 21, Article 32, Article 55, Article 83","1. The case involves Accor, a controller processing personal data of data subjects who registered accounts on its website, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means.

2. The controller used a pre-ticked box for consent to receive promotional materials, which violates Article 4(11) and Article 7(1) GDPR, as consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, requiring an affirmative action by the data subject. Pre-ticked boxes do not constitute valid consent.

3. Data subjects were unable to unsubscribe from direct marketing emails due to technical glitches, violating Article 7(3) GDPR, which guarantees the right to withdraw consent at any time, and Article 21(2) GDPR, which requires that data subjects can object to processing for direct marketing purposes easily and effectively.

4. The website failed to provide necessary information to data subjects at the time of data collection, including the controller's contact details, purposes of processing, legal basis, retention period, potential transfers, and the right to lodge a complaint, as required under Article 13(1) GDPR. The absence of a privacy policy or link thereto further exacerbates this violation.

5. The controller failed to respond to a data subject's access request regarding personal banking data, even after identity verification, violating Article 15 GDPR, which grants data subjects the right to access their personal data and obtain information about its processing.

6. The controller implemented inadequate security measures for accessing the ""Adobe Campaign"" account, using a weak password, which violates Article 32(1) GDPR, requiring appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access.

7. Given that Accor's main establishment is in France, the CNIL acted as the lead supervisory authority per Article 56(1) GDPR, and multiple supervisory authorities were involved, indicating cross-border processing under Article 4(23) GDPR.

8. The cumulative violations—invalid consent mechanism, failure to facilitate withdrawal of consent, lack of transparency, non-compliance with access rights, and insufficient security measures—demonstrate systemic non-compliance with multiple GDPR principles, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), and integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)).

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"Following a complaint filed by a data subject, the Romanian DPA started an investigation against CDI Transport, a passenger transport company (controller).

During the investigation, the company did not answer the DPA's request within the legal term.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 58","1. The case involves a passenger transport company (CDI Transport) acting as a data controller, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as it processes personal data in the context of its activities (Article 2 and Article 4 definition of 'controller').

2. The data subject complained that the controller's website did not include all necessary information in its privacy policy. Under Article 13, where personal data are collected directly from the data subject (as through a website), the controller must provide specific information including but not limited to: the identity and contact details of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis for processing, recipients of data, data retention periods, data subject rights, and right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

3. During the investigation, the Romanian DPA (supervisory authority) requested information from the controller pursuant to its investigative powers under Article 58(1)(a), which allows supervisory authorities to ""order the controller and the processor... to provide any information it requires for the performance of its tasks.""

4. The controller failed to respond to the DPA's request within the legal term, thereby violating Article 31, which states: ""The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.""

5. The controller's failure to provide complete privacy information (violating Article 13) and failure to cooperate with the supervisory authority (violating Article 31) constitute infringements of the GDPR.

"The Romanian DPA started an investigation into Denmar Nacrut SRL, a beauty salon (controller) after it received a complaint about excessive surveillance systems. During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller had installed CCTV cameras inside and outside its beauty salon, surveilling both its clients and its employees (data subjects) without clearly informing them.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13","1. The case involves Denmar Nacrut SRL as a data controller processing personal data through CCTV surveillance of both clients and employees, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means (CCTV systems) in the course of commercial activities.

2. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects about the processing of their personal data via CCTV, violating Article 12(1), which requires controllers to provide information relating to processing in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.

3. Specifically, the controller did not fulfill its obligations under Article 13, which mandates that when personal data is collected directly from the data subject (as with CCTV surveillance), the controller must provide information including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, and other necessary details at the time of data collection.

4. The processing of personal data through surveillance without a clear legal basis violates Article 6, which requires processing to be lawful under at least one specified condition (e.g., consent, legitimate interests). The absence of clear information suggests no valid consent was obtained, and the legitimate interests condition requires balancing tests that were not demonstrated.

5. The case involves monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a considerable scale (inside and outside the salon), which under Article 35(3)(c) requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). The controller's failure to conduct a DPIA where necessary further demonstrates noncompliance.

6. The surveillance of employees and clients without proper safeguards contravenes the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in Article 5(1)(a), as the data subjects were not adequately informed, and the processing may not be justified under any legal basis without transparency.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of the GDPR, including failures in transparency (Articles 12 and 13), lawfulness (Article 6), and potentially the requirement for a DPIA (Article 35)."
"The data subject received marketing messages via SMS from Sephora Romania (the controller). She requested the controller to stop using her personal data for marketing purposes. Despite the controllers confirmation that it would no longer process her personal data for marketing purposes, she kept receiving messages.

The data subject therefore filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 21,"1. The case involves a data subject who received marketing messages via SMS from Sephora Romania (the controller) and requested the cessation of such processing, which falls under the scope of GDPR as it concerns the processing of personal data for marketing purposes (Article 4(2) defining processing, and Article 6(1)(a) or (f) potentially applying to marketing).

2. The data subject exercised her right to object to processing for marketing purposes under Article 21(2) and (3), which states that where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time, and upon objection, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.

3. Despite the controller's confirmation that it would cease processing for marketing purposes, the data subject continued to receive marketing messages, indicating that the controller failed to comply with the data subject's objection without delay as required by Article 21(3).

4. The controller's failure to halt processing after the objection constitutes a violation of the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing continued without a valid legal basis (consent withdrawn or legitimate interests overridden by the objection).

5. Additionally, the controller's actions may violate the principle of accountability under Article 5(2), as it failed to demonstrate compliance with the data subject's request and the GDPR principles.

6. The data subject lodged a complaint with the Romanian DPA under Article 77, which is the appropriate recourse when a data subject believes their rights under GDPR have been infringed.

7. The persistent marketing after the objection and confirmed cessation promise indicates a breach of the data subject's rights under Articles 21 and 7(3) (right to withdraw consent, if applicable), and Article 12 (obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically with Articles 5(1)(a), 5(2), 7(3), 12, and 21."
"A controller (SC Wabag Water Services SRL) registered and made an appointment on the COVID-19 vaccination website on behalf of its employees without their consent. Consequently, one of the affected data subjects (the controller's employee) filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a controller (SC Wabag Water Services SRL) processing personal data of its employees by registering them for COVID-19 vaccinations without their consent, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. The processing includes health-related data (vaccination appointments), which qualifies as special category data under Article 9(1) as it concerns health information, requiring explicit consent or other specific legal bases under Article 9(2) for lawful processing.

3. The controller processed this special category data without obtaining explicit consent from the data subjects (employees), violating Article 9(2)(a), which requires explicit consent for processing special category data unless another condition applies.

4. The controller did not have a valid alternative legal basis under Article 9(2) for processing this health data without consent, such as necessity for employment obligations (which would require authorization under Member State law) or public health reasons (which would require Union or Member State law basis), and no such basis is indicated in the case.

5. The processing also violates the general principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent. Registering employees without their consent lacks lawfulness and transparency.

6. Additionally, the controller failed to comply with Article 6(1), which requires at least one lawful basis for processing. Without consent or another valid basis (e.g., legitimate interests would not override the data subject's rights for health data), the processing is unlawful.

7. The case involves a complaint by a data subject, highlighting the infringement of their rights under Articles 15-22, particularly the right to be informed and the right to object, but the core issue is the lack of lawful basis for processing special category data.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to unauthorized processing of special category personal data without a valid legal basis, violating Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1), and 9(1)/(2)."
"Mediconnect is an IT system offered by EG Digital Welfare ApS (the processor) and used by municipalities, regions, insurance companies, and specialist doctors to process personal data, including health information. In June 2021, the DPA received complaints about weak security in using the Mediconnect platform and decided to examine the matter. The investigation showed that users could access the system via a username and password. The users had an opportunity to use the Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) which uses claims-based authentication. However, not all users opted for it. In addition, the processor stored the passwords in plain text in a database which only employees with work-related needs could access.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves EG Digital Welfare ApS acting as a processor handling personal data, including special category health data, on behalf of controllers (municipalities, regions, insurance companies, and specialist doctors) through the Mediconnect platform, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation (Article 2).

2. The processing of health data constitutes processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), which is generally prohibited unless specific conditions are met. While Article 9(2)(h) may provide a lawful basis for processing health data for healthcare purposes, this does not exempt the processor from implementing appropriate security measures.

3. As a processor, EG Digital Welfare ApS is subject to the obligations under Article 28, which requires processors to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, and to process personal data only on documented instructions from the controller.

4. Article 32(1) specifically requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including (a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data, and (b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services.

5. The investigation revealed that the processor stored passwords in plain text in a database, which constitutes a failure to implement appropriate security measures as required by Article 32(1). Storing passwords in plain text violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) and specifically fails to implement encryption or pseudonymisation measures as referenced in Article 32(1)(a).

6. While the system offered ADFS claims-based authentication, the fact that not all users opted for it and that passwords were stored in plain text demonstrates insufficient technical measures to protect personal data, particularly sensitive health data which requires higher protection under Article 9.

7. The processor's failure to implement appropriate security measures violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they are unable to demonstrate compliance with the security requirements of the Regulation.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"Salling Group (the controller) is Denmark's largest retail group which serves 11 million customers per week. In 2021, they implemented a system allowing customers to shop on its websites (namely Føtex, Bilka, Netto, Salling and Carl Junior) using the same username and password (Salling Group profile). The controller also established a monitoring tool to record incidents and events about customers' access to the websites. However, in May 2022, the controller found that the monitoring system's log file stored customers' usernames and unencrypted passwords for the website ""hjem.foetex.dk"" by mistake. As a result, 146 people employed by the controller had technical access to the data. If an unauthorised person used the login credentials, they could access the customer's name, address, email address, telephone number, masked card information and purchase history. The controller reported the breach to the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Salling Group as the controller processing personal data of customers, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2, since the processing is wholly or partly by automated means and part of a filing system.

2. The controller stored usernames and unencrypted passwords in a log file, which constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it led to unauthorized access to personal data.

3. Storing passwords unencrypted violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access.

4. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data. The failure to encrypt passwords demonstrates noncompliance with this article.

5. The breach allowed 146 employees to have technical access to the data, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive personal data such as names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, masked card information, and purchase history, violating data subjects' rights under Articles 15-22.

6. Although the controller reported the breach to the DPA as required by Article 33, the occurrence of the breach due to inadequate security measures indicates a failure to comply with GDPR security obligations.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Icelandic DPA started an investigation into a genetic research company. More specifically, to assess the company's Data Protection Officer (DPO), as well as the performance of the DPO's tasks.

The DPA requested information from the company to determine if and how the company's DPO was compatible with Article 38 GDPR. The DPA stated that the decision to investigate the DPO  was made with the intention of ensuring compliance, not because it assumed the requirements of the GDPR were not being followed.

The DPA wrote two letters, but the company did not respond to any of them within the prescribed deadlines. After a phone call, the DPA received a response almost two months after the first letter had been sent.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 38, Article 39","1. The case involves a genetic research company subject to the GDPR, as it processes personal data (including genetic data, a special category under Article 9) and is investigated by the Icelandic DPA, a supervisory authority under Article 51.

2. The Icelandic DPA, exercising its investigative powers under Article 58(1)(a), requested information from the company to assess compliance with Article 38 (position of the Data Protection Officer). Article 58(1)(a) explicitly grants supervisory authorities the power ""to order the controller and the processor... to provide any information it requires for the performance of its tasks.""

3. The company failed to respond to two formal letters from the DPA within the prescribed deadlines. Article 31 of the GDPR states: ""The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks."" The company's failure to respond constitutes a clear violation of this obligation to cooperate.

4. The company's eventual response, received almost two months after the initial request and only after a phone call from the DPA, does not rectify the initial failure to comply within the prescribed deadlines. The GDPR requires prompt cooperation, and such a significant delay demonstrates a lack of compliance with the obligation under Article 31.

5. The failure to provide requested information to a supervisory authority acting within its powers is an infringement of the GDPR. According to Article 83(4)(a), infringements of obligations pursuant to Article 31 are subject to administrative fines.

6. Therefore, based on the company's failure to cooperate with the supervisory authority by not responding to its information requests in a timely manner, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the social and health authority of the city of Oulu (the controller) had required persons applying to become foster parents to request access to their personal data processed by the police and to provide this information to the controller.

The DPA had asked the controller to explain for what purpose it processed the personal data and why it required the data subjects to provide this information.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the information received from the police was required in the process of approving applicants as foster parents. The controller had to ensure that the conditions at the foster home were safe and stable and that the children placed in foster care received better care than at home. The controller claimed that the information about, among other things, domestic violence and disruptive behaviour was necessary because it hindered working as a foster parent.

The controller stated that the police did not disclose the information based solely on the consent of the data subject. For this reason, it had become a practice to request the information directly from persons applying to become foster parents.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6, Article 10, Article 58","1. The case involves the processing of personal data related to criminal convictions and offenses, as applicants are required to provide police data including information about domestic violence and disruptive behavior, which falls under the scope of Article 10 of the GDPR.

2. Article 10 requires that processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses must be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union or Member State law providing appropriate safeguards. The controller (city of Oulu) is not an official authority like the police and is using a practice where applicants themselves obtain and provide this data, which bypasses the proper legal channel required under Article 10.

3. The controller claims the processing is necessary for assessing foster parent applications to ensure child safety, but fails to demonstrate a specific legal basis under Union or Member State law that authorizes this particular processing activity, as required by Article 6(1) and Article 10. The practice of requiring applicants to obtain and submit their own police data is not grounded in a lawful processing condition.

4. The principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) is violated because the processing lacks a valid legal basis. The controller's method of obtaining data through applicant self-service does not comply with the strict requirements for processing special categories of data (including criminal data) under Article 10.

5. The controller's action also violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as requiring broad access to police data without specifying the exact necessities for foster parent assessment may lead to processing more data than needed for the purpose.

6. Furthermore, the practice potentially infringes on Article 15 (right of access) by effectively requiring data subjects to exercise their access rights for the controller's benefit rather than their own, which is not the intended purpose of this right.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A data subject who had purchased goods from TeeShoppen, an e-commerce platform (the controller), and was getting marketing messages, asked the controller to delete his personal data. Subsequently, on 24 June 2019, the controller informed the data subject that his data would be deleted. When this was not done, the data subject contacted the Danish DPA. The controller confirmed to the DPA that it had deleted the personal data of the data subject. On 8 October 2020, the DPA reprimanded the controller for not immediately complying with Article 17 GDPR and closed the case. In Autumn of 2021, the data subject started receiving marketing emails again, and thus contacted the Danish DPA. The DPA sought replies from the controller but none was received.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 21","1. The case involves a data subject who exercised their right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR by requesting TeeShoppen (the controller) to delete their personal data, which the controller acknowledged on 24 June 2019 but failed to implement promptly.

2. Article 17(1) requires controllers to erase personal data ""without undue delay"" when one of the stipulated grounds applies, such as withdrawal of consent (which applies here as marketing communications rely on consent). The controller's failure to immediately comply upon request constitutes a violation of this obligation.

3. The controller's confirmation to the Danish DPA that deletion had occurred, while later evidence showed marketing communications resumed in Autumn 2021, indicates either incomplete erasure or unlawful reprocessing of personal data, further violating Article 17(1).

4. Article 12(3) requires controllers to provide information on action taken regarding data subject requests ""without undue delay and in any event within one month."" The controller's failure to respond to the DPA's inquiries in 2021 violates this communication obligation.

5. The resumed marketing communications in 2021 also violate Article 21(2) and (3), which require controllers to stop processing for direct marketing immediately upon objection and explicitly state that personal data ""shall no longer be processed for such purposes"" after objection.

6. The controller's failure to maintain adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure ongoing compliance with erasure requests violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the security obligations under Article 32(1).

7. The absence of cooperation with the supervisory authority (Danish DPA) violates Article 31, which mandates that controllers shall cooperate with supervisory authorities on request.

8. The recurrence of non-compliance after the DPA's formal reprimand in 2020 demonstrates systematic failures in the controller's data protection practices, aggravating the violation under Article 83(2)(e) regarding previous infringements.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"After being contacted by former employees of Fitness World A/S (the controller), the Danish DPA opened an investigation into the controller's processing of personal data. The investigation focused on the claims that the controller had been using video surveillance at work without adequately informing the employees. Another allegation concerned the case of storing employees' data about, among other things, resignations, contracts, written warnings, medical certificates and video surveillance recordings locally on a shared computer which was freely accessible to other employees.

The controller responded to the DPA that it carried out video surveillance in all its centres based on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to prevent crime, increase the safety of its employees and members, and prevent gross violations of its internal rules. The controller also claimed that it had informed its employees about the monitoring in the employment contract, the staff handbook, the privacy policy for employees and the controller's policy on video surveillance. In addition, the entrance areas had clear signs informing those coming in about video surveillance. As for the storing of employees' data locally on a shared computer, the controller stated that this occurred because of an error from the manager who saved the documents on the wrong drive. The controller dealt with the situation individually and improved its practices to prevent future mistakes.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 32","1. The case involves Fitness World A/S as a data controller processing employees' personal data through video surveillance and storing employment-related documents, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (processing operations by automated means and filing systems).

2. For video surveillance, the controller relied on Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) as the legal basis. However, under Article 13, when personal data is collected from the data subject (here, employees), the controller must provide specific information at the time of data collection, including: the purposes and legal basis for processing (Article 13(1)(c)), the legitimate interests pursued (Article 13(1)(d)), and the existence of the right to object (Article 13(2)(b)). The controller claimed to have provided this information through employment contracts, handbooks, and policies, but the Danish DPA found the information inadequate, indicating a violation of transparency obligations under Article 12(1) (clear and plain language) and Article 13.

3. The storage of employees' sensitive data (e.g., medical certificates) on a shared computer accessible to other employees violates Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle), as personal data must be processed securely against unauthorized access. This also breaches Article 32, which requires appropriate technical measures (e.g., access controls) to ensure security, especially for special categories of data under Article 9 (e.g., health data), which require higher safeguards.

4. The controller's argument that the insecure storage was due to a manager's error does not absolve responsibility under Article 5(2) (accountability principle), as controllers must demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles regardless of internal mistakes. The corrective actions taken (e.g., improving practices) were reactive, not preventive, further highlighting noncompliance.

5. For video surveillance, the controller failed to conduct a balancing test as required under Article 6(1)(f) to ensure legitimate interests override data subjects' rights. The DPA likely found the surveillance disproportionate, especially without evidence that less intrusive measures were considered, violating the data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c)).

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of transparency (Articles 12, 13), security (Articles 5(1)(f), 32), and lawful processing principles (Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1)(f))."
"The investigation was started after a data breach notification from Alpha Bank Romania (controller) to the Romanian DPA pursuant to Article 33 GDPR. The controller reported that a document was sent to another recipient through WhatsApp by mistake.

The incident resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data of 4 data subjects, such as their name and surname, personal identification number, position and signature, type of credit, number and date of contract signature, credit period and the last due date.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 29, Article 32","1. The case involves Alpha Bank Romania as the data controller, which is subject to GDPR regulations as it processes personal data (Article 4(7)).

2. The controller reported a personal data breach involving unauthorized disclosure of personal data through WhatsApp, including names, identification numbers, positions, signatures, and credit information of 4 data subjects (Article 4(1) defining personal data).

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized disclosure, using appropriate technical and organizational measures.

4. Article 32(1) mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

5. The use of WhatsApp for transmitting sensitive personal data without adequate security measures (such as end-to-end encryption verification, access controls, or recipient validation) constitutes a failure to implement appropriate technical measures under Article 32(1).

6. Article 24(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR, which includes establishing secure communication protocols for personal data transmission.

7. The accidental disclosure via WhatsApp indicates insufficient organizational measures (such as staff training, communication protocols, and verification procedures) to prevent human error in data transmission, violating Articles 24(1) and 32(1).

8. While the controller fulfilled its breach notification obligation under Article 33, the breach itself resulted from non-compliance with security requirements under Articles 5(1)(f), 24(1), and 32(1).

9. The personal data disclosed included identifiers and financial information that could pose risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms, requiring higher security measures under Article 32(2).

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to the controller's failure to implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data."
"The Danish DPA had decided to investigate three research projects of Region Syddanmark (the controller) with regards to its processing activities, the use of processors, data processing agreements and processor audit practices.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves Region Syddanmark as a data controller processing personal data for research purposes, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope), which applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means.

2. The investigation focuses on the controller's processing activities, use of processors, data processing agreements, and processor audit practices. Under Article 28(3), processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or other legal act that sets out specific requirements, including that the processor processes personal data only on documented instructions from the controller and implements appropriate security measures.

3. The verdict of NONCOMPLIANT indicates that the controller failed to meet its obligations under Article 28, particularly regarding the requirement for a binding contract with processors that includes all necessary data protection clauses as specified in Article 28(3)(a-h), such as ensuring confidentiality, implementing security measures, and assisting the controller in fulfilling data subject rights.

4. Additionally, Article 32 requires the controller and processor to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including pseudonymisation, encryption, and regular testing of security measures. The lack of proper processor audit practices suggests a failure to comply with these security obligations.

5. Article 30 mandates that controllers maintain records of processing activities, including details such as the purposes of processing, categories of data subjects, and recipients of data. The investigation likely found deficiencies in these records, contributing to noncompliance.

6. The principles of data protection under Article 5, such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and integrity and confidentiality, are violated if the controller did not ensure proper safeguards in its processing activities and relationships with processors.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to failures in adhering to the requirements for processor contracts, security measures, record-keeping, and overall accountability as outlined in Articles 28, 32, 30, and 5 of the GDPR."
"The Chief National Surveyor (the controller) accidentally disclosed land and mortgage register numbers on its website. The numbers were publicly available for about 48 hours. The controller did not notify the DPA and the affected data subjects of this event.

In the investigation that followed, the controller claimed first, that the data disclosed were not personal data. Second, it argued that their publication was lawful and therefore did not constitute a data breach. Lastly, the controller submitted that, in any case, this disclosure did not entail any risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons due to the short-term nature of the disclosure and the availability of the data in other sources. For this reason, the controller deemed that there was no need to notify the DPA and the affected data subjects under Articles 33(1) and 34(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves the Chief National Surveyor as the controller, which is responsible for processing personal data under the GDPR, as defined in Article 4(7).

2. The disclosed data (land and mortgage register numbers) qualify as personal data under Article 4(1), as they relate to identifiable natural persons (property owners) and can be used alone or combined with other information to identify individuals.

3. The accidental disclosure constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), defined as a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data.

4. The controller's claim that the publication was lawful is invalid under Article 5(1)(a), as any processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent. Accidental disclosure without a valid legal basis (e.g., consent under Article 6 or public interest under Article 6(1)(e)) violates this principle.

5. The controller's argument that the data was already publicly available does not negate the breach, as Article 5(1)(f) requires appropriate security against unauthorized disclosure, and the accidental nature makes it non-compliant.

6. Under Article 33(1), the controller must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach within 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless it is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. The controller failed to do so.

7. Under Article 34(1), the controller must communicate the breach to affected data subjects without undue delay if it is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The controller failed to do so.

8. The controller's claim that the breach posed no risk due to its short duration and public availability of data is insufficient, as Article 33(1) and Article 34(1) require a risk assessment based on the nature of the breach. Unauthorized access to personal data, even temporarily, inherently risks misuse (e.g., identity theft or fraud), as highlighted in Recital 85.

9. The controller's failure to notify both the supervisory authority and data subjects violates Articles 33(1) and 34(1), respectively, regardless of the breach's duration or the data's availability elsewhere.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The University Clinical Center of the Medical University of Warsaw (the controller) gave one of its patients a referral to a specialist clinic. Due to the referring doctor's error, the referral included personal data relating to another person (the data subject). It included the data subject's first name, surname, address, PESEL number (i.e. an eleven-digit numeric symbol, uniquely identifying a natural person, containing the date of birth, serial number, gender and a control number) and health-related information, such as their diagnosis.

Since the first name of the data subject contained a typo, the controller considered that the data in question related to a non-existing person. For this reason, the controller decided that the incident was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject and did not notify the DPA or the data subject of the data breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves the University Clinical Center as a controller processing personal data, including special categories of health data, as defined in Article 4(1) and Article 9(1) of the GDPR, since the data includes first name, surname, address, PESEL number (a unique identifier), and health-related information such as diagnosis.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as personal data was disclosed to an unauthorized recipient (the patient who received the referral) due to a doctor's error.

3. Article 33(1) requires the controller to notify the supervisory authority (DPA) of a personal data breach without undue delay, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

4. The controller decided not to notify based on the assessment that the first name typo made the data relate to a non-existing person, thus deeming the breach unlikely to result in a risk. However, the PESEL number is designed to uniquely identify a natural person, and even with a name typo, the combination of address, PESEL, and health data could still identify the data subject, posing a risk to privacy and other rights under Article 32 and Recital 75, which include identity theft, discrimination, and reputational damage.

5. Article 33(1) places the burden on the controller to demonstrate that the breach is unlikely to result in a risk. The controller's assessment was insufficient and incorrect, as the data could still be linked to an identifiable individual, especially given the sensitivity of health data under Article 9(1), which requires enhanced protection.

6. Therefore, the controller failed to comply with Article 33(1) by not notifying the supervisory authority of the breach.

7. Additionally, under Article 34(1), if the breach is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms, the controller must communicate it to the data subject. The involvement of health data suggests a potential high risk, but even if not, the lack of notification to the DPA alone constitutes noncompliance.

8. Thus, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Municipality of Policoro (Basilicata), implemented the use of CCTV cameras to monitor and fight waste abandonment within its territory.  A data subject complained the Municipality had breached their data protection right of fair, transparent and lawful processing under art. 5(1)(a) as the sign signaling the CCTV monitoring referred to an outdated legislative decree.  They also alleged a breach of art. 5(1)(e) and art. 13 GDPR, in so far the municipality never defined a data retention period for each processing purpose pursued.  The last complaint moved forward by the data subject was that by being legally represented in Court by the same lawyer, who also acted as DPO of Policoro, the Municipality gave rise to a conflict of interest situation and breached art. 38(6) GDPR.

The Municipality argued that the claim had been done in front of the Justice of Peace, who had no competency to decide on issues of privacy.  It was also alleged the judgement only pertained an administrative matter, without rising any data protection concerns or a situation of conflict of interest with the Municipality's DPO.  The last argument alleged the processing and retention of the CCTV footage was related to illegal dumps within the municipal territory, meaning the filming had been carried out in the course of judicial police investigations and the data retention periods of the GDPR did not apply in this case.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 38, Article 83","1. The case involves the Municipality of Policoro as a data controller implementing CCTV surveillance, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR, requiring compliance with data protection principles under Article 5.

2. The data subject alleged a violation of Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, transparency) because the CCTV signage referenced an outdated legislative decree. Under Article 12(1), controllers must provide transparent information using clear language, and Article 13 requires accurate information about the legal basis for processing. Referencing obsolete legislation misrepresents the legal basis and violates transparency obligations.

3. The data subject alleged a violation of Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation) as no retention period was defined. Article 5(1)(e) requires personal data to be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary, and Article 13(2)(a) mandates informing data subjects of storage periods. The Municipality's failure to define and communicate a retention period violates these provisions.

4. The Municipality argued that processing fell under ""judicial police investigations"" and claimed GDPR retention rules didn't apply. However, Article 2(2)(d) excludes processing by competent authorities for law enforcement purposes (governed by Directive (EU) 2016/680), not general municipal waste monitoring. The CCTV operation here was for general public space monitoring, not specific criminal investigations, so the GDPR fully applies.

5. The data subject alleged a conflict of interest under Article 38(6) as the Municipality's legal representative in court was simultaneously serving as DPO. Article 38(6) prohibits tasks/duties that result in conflicts of interest, and Recital 97 emphasizes the DPO's independent role. Representing the controller in legal proceedings while serving as DPO creates a clear conflict, as the DPO must independently monitor compliance and advise the controller objectively.

6. The Municipality's jurisdictional argument (Justice of Peace lacking competence) is irrelevant to substantive GDPR compliance, as data protection rights can be raised in any legal proceeding per Articles 77-79.

7. Therefore, the case involves multiple violations: lack of transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), absence of storage limitation measures (Article 5(1)(e)), failure to provide required information (Article 13), and DPO conflict of interest (Article 38(6)).

8. Consequently, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"Following the Danish DPA's (Datatilsynet) decisions (from September 2021 as well as July and August 2022) related to Helsingor municipality's processing of personal data using Google products and services, Aarhus municipality reassessed their risk assessment during August 2022. On 1 September, they sent the DPA a request for consultation as per Article 36 GDPR along with the relevant documentation, as they were using the same processing setup (Google, Google Chromebooks, Google Workspace for Education).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 36, Article 58","1. The case involves Aarhus municipality (a data controller) using Google products and services (Google Chromebooks and Google Workspace for Education) for processing personal data, which constitutes processing operations under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. The municipality conducted a risk assessment and subsequently requested prior consultation with the supervisory authority under Article 36(1), indicating they identified that their processing operations would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken to mitigate the risk.

3. The use of Google as a processor requires compliance with Article 28, which mandates that controllers use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to meet GDPR requirements. The documentation submitted for consultation likely revealed insufficient guarantees regarding Google's compliance, particularly concerning data transfers outside the EU/EEA.

4. The processing involves potential transfers of personal data to the United States (a third country), which requires appropriate safeguards under Article 46. Given the invalidation of the Privacy Shield framework and the concerns raised in the Schrems II case (C-311/18), the reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses alone may be insufficient without supplementary measures, as confirmed by the European Data Protection Board recommendations.

5. The Danish DPA's previous decisions regarding Helsingør municipality's similar use of Google services established that such processing violates Articles 28(1) and 46(1) due to inadequate safeguards for international data transfers and insufficient guarantees from the processor.

6. The municipality's need for prior consultation under Article 36, coupled with the established precedent from Helsingør municipality, indicates that the processing operations lack compliance with Chapter V (Transfers of personal data to third countries) and the general principles of data protection under Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality).

7. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 28, 46, and the general principles of the GDPR as established in related DPA decisions, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Following informations received from the Internet, the Romanian DPA launched an ex officio investigation into Realmedia Network SA (the controller) for a possible data breach. The controller operates a real estate platform called imobiliare.ro, where agencies and individuals can advertise their properties.

The DPA's investigation revealed the unauthorized disclosure and access to the following personal data that was not supposed to be accessible: name, surname, telephone number, email address, postal address, personal numerical code, signature, copies of identity cards, including identification codes, function/quality, bank data, information included in land deed extracts/cadastral drafts, property titles and user profile image. 194,309 data subjects were impacted.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Realmedia Network SA as a data controller operating a real estate platform (imobiliare.ro), which processes personal data of users advertising properties, making it subject to GDPR regulations as per Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processing'.

2. The investigation revealed unauthorized disclosure and access to multiple categories of personal data including names, contact information, identity documents, financial data, and special categories of data (personal numerical code, copies of identity cards), which constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12).

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), particularly given the sensitive nature of the data processed (identity documents, financial information) which would necessitate strong encryption and access controls.

4. The breach affected 194,309 data subjects, indicating a large-scale processing operation where the controller should have implemented more robust security measures, including pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data as specified in Article 32(1)(a).

5. The disclosure of special categories of personal data (including identity card copies containing biometric data and personal numerical codes) likely occurred without a valid lawful basis under Article 9, as such sensitive data requires explicit consent or other specific conditions that were not mentioned as being properly obtained.

6. The controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access.

7. Given the scale and nature of the breach (affecting nearly 200,000 individuals and involving sensitive data), the controller likely failed to conduct a proper data protection impact assessment as required by Article 35, particularly for processing operations that are likely to result in high risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons.

8. The controller may have violated Article 33 regarding notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority, as the investigation was launched based on information from the internet rather than a mandatory breach notification from the controller.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including inadequate security measures, unauthorized processing of special category data, failure to protect against unauthorized disclosure, and likely failure to properly assess risks and notify authorities of the breach."
"The DPA received 17 notifications of data breaches regarding Raiffeisen Bank SA (the controller). The notifications were (for the most part) done by the controller itself and affected its customers (the data subjects). Therefore, the DPA started an investigation into the controller. During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller used the systems managed by the Credit Bureau S.A., the National Tax Administration Agency (ANAF) and its own IT systems to simulate credit decisions (""pre-scoring"") for an external credit broker.

Two notifications were about pre-scoring operations carried out for (potential) customers, concerning at least 169 data subjects. The DPA found that the controller used the Credit Bureau System without the necessary signature from the data subjects to access their data in the respective system.

The controller further notified the DPA about a data breach that resulted in the context of loans to individual data subjects with the help of an external company, acting as a processor. Apparently, some data subjects were approved for loans without them having requested them and without having signed any relevant documents regarding these loans.

In addition, four data breaches happened in the context of email communications. The cause for every one of these data breaches was that the controller entered a wrong e-mail address. In one case, as a result of two data subjects submitting similar complaints, the controller sent documents containing personal data belonging to one data subject to the other.

Another incident concerned a situation involving suspected internal credit fraud. To investigate the suspected fraud, the controller carried out specific operations to grant a loan to a data subject without the presence of the data subject. The controller applied for credit facilities, completed and signed the documentation related to the credit facility. To update the data subjects' data in its application, the controller changed the data subjects' phone number with a phone number of one of its employees and entered a fictitious email address. A similar data breach took place when the controller granted three credit facilities (Flexicredit, Flexicredit refinancing and Purchasing Card) in the name of a data subject without the latter having actually requested these.

Last, a data breach consisted of the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of some data subjects from their Smart Mobile account (the mobile banking service provided by the controller) to other customers of the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves Raiffeisen Bank SA as a data controller processing personal data of its customers (data subjects), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1), as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller performed pre-scoring operations using the Credit Bureau System without obtaining necessary signatures from data subjects to access their data. This violates Article 6(1), which requires processing to have a lawful basis such as consent, and Article 22(1), which gives data subjects the right not to be subject to automated decision-making including profiling without appropriate safeguards or explicit consent.

3. The controller approved loans for data subjects without their requests or signed documentation, using an external company as a processor. This constitutes processing without a lawful basis under Article 6(1) and violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a). Additionally, the controller failed to ensure the processor provided sufficient guarantees under Article 28(1) to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures.

4. Multiple data breaches occurred due to incorrect email addresses being entered, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of personal data to wrong recipients. This violates the security principle under Article 5(1)(f) and the obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures under Article 32(1) to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

5. The controller investigated suspected internal fraud by creating fake applications using employee phone numbers and fictitious email addresses. This processing lacked a lawful basis under Article 6(1) and violated the accuracy principle under Article 5(1)(d), as data was not kept accurate and up-to-date.

6. Unauthorised disclosure of personal data from Smart Mobile accounts to other customers occurred, indicating failure to implement appropriate security measures under Article 32(1) to prevent unauthorized access to personal data.

7. The cumulative effect of these multiple breaches demonstrates systematic non-compliance with the GDPR's core principles under Article 5(1), including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, and integrity/confidentiality.

8. The controller failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2) by not implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the regulation.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"KMD A/S (processor) is a Danish IT service provider offering digital solutions for various industries, including the public sector. Between 19 and 21 January 2021, several municipalities complained to the DPA about a data breach caused by the KMD, which the DPA decided to investigate.

The breach involved the AULA platform used to process children's information from schools and daycares and controlled by another processor, namely KOMBIT A/S. As a result of an update run by KMD in its systems, the information about foster parents was sent to AULA, giving them access to foster children's information which they were not supposed to have. However, the KMD denied its responsibility during the breach investigation, suggesting that it could not test how the update worked with the recipient's system AULA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves KMD A/S, an IT service provider acting as a processor, and KOMBIT A/S, another processor controlling the AULA platform, processing personal data of children from schools and daycares, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and involves special categories of data concerning children as per Article 9.

2. As a processor, KMD A/S is subject to the obligations under Article 28, which requires processors to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as further detailed in Article 32.

3. The data breach occurred due to an update run by KMD in its systems, which resulted in foster parents gaining unauthorized access to foster children's information. This indicates a failure in implementing adequate security measures and safeguards, violating Article 32(1), which mandates measures such as ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and resilience of processing systems.

4. Article 28(3) requires that processing by a processor is governed by a contract or legal act that stipulates the processor processes personal data only on documented instructions from the controller. KMD's update, which led to unauthorized data disclosure, suggests a failure to adhere to the controller's instructions or to ensure the processing met GDPR requirements, potentially violating this provision.

5. Additionally, Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify supervisory authorities of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. While the case mentions municipalities complained to the DPA, it implies that KMD, as a processor, may have failed to notify the controller (KOMBIT A/S) without undue delay as required by Article 33(2), contributing to the breach's impact.

6. KMD denied responsibility during the investigation, suggesting it could not test how the update worked with the recipient's system AULA. This denial indicates a lack of accountability and failure to demonstrate compliance with Article 5(2) (accountability principle) and Article 28(1), which requires processors to provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures.

7. The breach involved unauthorized access to sensitive data of children, which is a special category of data under Article 9, requiring higher protection. The failure to prevent such access violates the principles of data protection by design and by default under Article 25, which obligates controllers and processors to implement measures to ensure that, by default, only necessary personal data are processed.

8. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 28, 32, 33, and 25, and the principles of accountability and data protection by design, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The data subject had dealt with a medical laboratory (the controller) on several occasions. He underwent a medical analysis multiple times.  After hearing that his doctor had remote access to the results, the data subject found out that the website of the laboratory contained a link to a page for access to medical data under the name ‘Cyberplab’, which used an unsafe http-protocol.

The data subject filed a complaint at the Belgian DPA against the controller. After receiving the complaint, the DPA initiated an investigation into the matter.  The site was unencrypted with the http-protocol at the time of the first report of the investigation of the DPA. However, after the DPA had made contact with the controller, the controller added TLS 1.2 to the website, a basic protocol which is used for websites since 1999. Because of this, the site used the  https-protocol.

The controller challenged most findings of the investigation. The controller stated that it thought that it was the processor instead of the controller. The controller also stated that her processing operation was small before the pandemic but had since then grown into a large processing operation. Before the pandemic, it claimed to have 50 operations a day, but didn’t provide any statistics how much operations were undertaken each day during – and after the pandemic. The controller also stated that the GDPR doesn’t contain any provision that this information should be provided on a website at all. The controller also stated that, given the small number of processing before the COVID crisis, a posting of the information in its physical sites was sufficient during that time.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 35","1. The case involves a medical laboratory processing health data, which qualifies as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, requiring enhanced protections.

2. The laboratory acted as a controller under Article 4(7), as it determined the purposes and means of processing medical data, despite its claim of being a processor. Controllers bear primary responsibility for compliance under Article 24.

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical measures to ensure data security, as required by Article 32(1), specifically by using an unencrypted HTTP protocol for transmitting medical data, which exposed sensitive health information to potential unauthorized access.

4. The controller violated Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle) by failing to protect personal data against unauthorized processing through insecure transmission protocols.

5. The controller did not provide transparent information to data subjects about processing activities as required by Articles 13 and 14. The argument that physical notices were sufficient contradicts the requirement for easily accessible information, particularly for online services under Article 12(1).

6. The scale of processing (50 operations/day pre-pandemic) does not exempt the controller from basic security obligations under Articles 24 and 32, as GDPR compliance is not contingent on processing volume alone.

7. The belated implementation of TLS 1.2 after DPA intervention demonstrates prior non-compliance with Article 32's requirement for appropriate security measures implemented proactively.

8. The controller's challenge to the findings shows a lack of accountability under Article 5(2), as it failed to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles despite processing sensitive health data.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations including insecure data transmission, lack of transparency, and failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures."
"GIE INFOGREFFE (controller) has a website which allows consultation of legal information on companies. This website also provides the possibility to order certain documents. In its ""Confidentiality Charter"" on its website, the controller made a distinction between two kinds of users: ""members"" and ""subscribers"". ""Members"" were users who could order a selected paid service on the website, for which they needed an account. ""Subscribers"" were users who had subscribed to an annual subscription of the website.

A data subject filed a complaint at the DPA stating that he was able to get a password on the phone only by telling his name. The data subject also complained that the website stored user passwords in plain text. The DPA started an investigation into the website of the controller.

On its website, the controller had stated in the ""Confidentiality Charter"" that the personal data of members and subscribers were kept for 36 months after the last order from a customer requesting service or documents. The DPA found in its investigation that no procedure for the automatic deletion of personal data was used by the controller and that personal data was kept for excessive periods of time in relation to the respective purpose and the own policy set by the controller. The controller admitted that personal data had been kept for longer than 36 months but stated that for purposes such as 'collection operations', it would be justified for certain data to be stored for a longer period of time.

With regard to the manual anonymization of personal data upon requests of users, the controller admitted that 25% of accounts were kept for more than 36 months after the last order, formality or invoice, without being anonymized. The was also no automatic anonymization procedure implemented by the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller (GIE INFOGREFFE) processing personal data through its website, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller's stated policy in its ""Confidentiality Charter"" specified that personal data of members and subscribers would be kept for 36 months after the last order, which relates to the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e) requiring that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes.

3. The investigation revealed that the controller failed to implement an automatic deletion procedure, resulting in personal data being retained beyond the 36-month period specified in its own policy, violating the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e).

4. The controller's claim that longer retention was justified for 'collection operations' lacks a demonstrated lawful basis under Article 6, and does not override the fundamental principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e), particularly as no appropriate safeguards or specific legal authorization for such extended retention were demonstrated.

5. The manual anonymization process was insufficient, with 25% of accounts retained beyond the 36-month period without anonymization, failing to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with the storage limitation principle as required under Article 25 (Data Protection by Design and by Default) and Article 5(2) (Accountability principle).

6. The absence of automatic anonymization procedures constitutes a failure to implement appropriate technical measures to ensure ongoing compliance with the storage limitation principle, as required under Article 25(1) and Article 32(1) (Security of processing).

7. The storage of passwords in plain text, as complained by the data subject, further demonstrates a failure to implement appropriate security measures under Article 32(1), particularly the requirement to ensure the ongoing confidentiality of personal data through appropriate technical measures.

8. The controller's actions violate multiple provisions including the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e)), accountability principle (Article 5(2)), data protection by design and by default (Article 25), and security requirements (Article 32).

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Greek DPA initiated an investigation regarding the processing of health data in accordance with its ex officio competences under Articles 51 and 55 GDPR and Article 9 of National Law 4624/2019. The DPA examined the legal compliance of the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Labor and of Social Affairs, the Naval Defense Fund, the Ministry of Health and IDIKA S.A. (the controllers) with regards to the processing of personal data on the COVID-19 self-test distribution platform.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 25, Article 35","1. The case involves the processing of health data, which is classified as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, requiring stricter protections and specific legal bases for processing.

2. The Greek DPA's investigation found that the controllers (Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Naval Defense Fund, Ministry of Health, and IDIKA S.A.) processed health data through the COVID-19 self-test distribution platform without establishing a proper legal basis under Article 6(1) for general processing and Article 9(2) for special category data processing.

3. The processing failed to meet the transparency requirements under Articles 12-14 of the GDPR, as data subjects were not adequately informed about the processing activities, including the purposes, legal basis, and data subject rights, particularly when data were not obtained directly from the data subjects (Article 14).

4. The controllers did not conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as required under Article 35(1) and (3), given that the processing of health data on a large scale constitutes high-risk processing, especially when involving systematic monitoring of data subjects.

5. The case involves multiple controllers without clearly defining their respective responsibilities and roles in accordance with Article 26 on joint controllers, leading to confusion and lack of accountability in the processing operations.

6. There was insufficient evidence of implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default under Article 25, given the sensitivity of the health data processed.

7. The processing did not comply with the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as more data than necessary were collected and processed for the stated purpose of distributing self-tests.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."
"A bank (the controller) organized prize games for its clients. Considering that it had a large number of clients who lived in urban areas where it is not uncommon for different people to have the same first and last name and at the same time have the same address, the controller considered it necessary to undoubtedly establish the identity of the participants. Thus, it collected and processed the winners' data, and published it on the website.

The Croatian DPA launched an investigation after it found out that the controller published the personal identification numbers (OIB) and residence addresses of the winners of the prize game on its website. Acting ex officio, the Croatian DPA requested a statement from the controller on the legal basis for such publication. The DPA also inquired on the method of informing the participants on the processing of their personal data under Article 13 GDPR.

In response, the bank argued that in order to participate in the prize draw, it was necessary to enter the name, surname, OIB, phone number or e-mail address. The above data was requested for identification purposes and thus was fulfilling the obligation of the bank to conduct the prize game in accordance with the Ordinance on the organization of prize games, which also includes notifying the winner about the award.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13","1. The case involves a bank (the controller) processing personal data of prize game winners, including their names, surnames, personal identification numbers (OIB), and residence addresses, and publishing this information on its website, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of processing and personal data).

2. The controller argued that the processing was necessary for identification purposes and to fulfill obligations under the Ordinance on the organization of prize games. However, under Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation), personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. Publishing full OIB and residence addresses exceeds what is necessary for merely notifying winners or ensuring transparency in prize games, as less intrusive means (e.g., partial identifiers or alternative contact methods) could have been used.

3. Article 13 requires the controller to provide specific information to data subjects at the time of data collection, including the purposes of processing, the legal basis, and the recipients of the data. The Croatian DPA inquired about compliance with Article 13, indicating that the controller may have failed to adequately inform participants that their data would be published online, which violates transparency obligations.

4. The publication of OIB and residence addresses on a website constitutes a form of processing that exposes data subjects to risks such as identity theft or unauthorized access, violating Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality), which requires appropriate security of personal data.

5. While the controller cited a legal obligation under national ordinance, Article 6(3) requires that such legal bases must be proportionate and respect the essence of data protection rights. Publishing highly sensitive identifiers like OIB and addresses is disproportionate and violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1).

6. The processing of OIB, which is a unique national identifier, falls under special consideration under Article 87, which allows Member States to impose specific conditions for such processing. However, even if national law permits it, the controller must still adhere to GDPR principles, including minimisation and security, which were not upheld here.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5, 6, 13, and 32, as the controller processed excessive personal data without proper justification, transparency, or security safeguards."
"The company Vodafone Romania SA, the data controller, notified the Romanian DPA of two personal data breaches. In its subsequent investigation, the DPA found that the data controller failed to comply with the applicable procedure to ensure that its processors adequately verify the identity of callers. Third parties were able to fraudulently purchase new phones on behalf of some of the data controller's customers and acquired access to their personal data, such as: name, surname, address, personal identification number, contact phone number, PUK code, contact number of the account holder, the SIM series of the original card, the amount of the last unpaid bill, and the data traffic.

The DPA found that the data controller did not adopt sufficient measures to ensure that any natural persons acting under its authority and who have access to the personal data of its costumers only process the personal data under its requests. The data controller lacked appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that its personal data processing had an appropriate level of confidentiality and security.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 29, Article 32","1. The case involves Vodafone Romania SA as a data controller processing personal data of its customers, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The data controller experienced personal data breaches where third parties fraudulently accessed customers' personal data, including sensitive information such as personal identification numbers, which could be considered special category data under certain contexts (Article 9).

3. The investigation found that the data controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), which specifically mandates measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems.

4. The data controller did not ensure that any natural person acting under its authority who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, as required by Article 32(4), which is a direct violation given that unauthorized third parties accessed and processed the data.

5. The lack of adequate identity verification procedures for callers constitutes a failure to implement appropriate measures to ensure that personal data are not accessed by unauthorized persons, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f).

6. The data controller's failure to prevent fraudulent purchases and unauthorized access to personal data demonstrates insufficient safeguards to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing, contrary to the security obligations outlined in Article 32.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1), and 32(4)."
"The company Banca Comercială Română SA, the data controller, notified the Romanian DPA of a personal data breach. The notification was made pursuent to Article 33 GDPR. The  notification stated that the breach occurred due to a technical error of an IT application.

In its investigation, the DPA found that e-mails containing the personal data of some customers were sent to the incorrect customers. The breach affected 564 data subjects and lead to the unauthorized access of personal data, such as: name and surname, CNP, home address, telephone number, email address, along with erroneously generated financial information regarding cumulative gain, cumulative loss, net gain, net loss, cumulative tax due, payment tax, and tax to be recovered.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves Banca Comercială Română SA as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing involves automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach due to a technical error in an IT application, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of personal data (including names, national identification numbers, addresses, contact information, and financial data) to incorrect recipients, affecting 564 data subjects.

3. Under Article 32(1) of the GDPR, the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data. The occurrence of this breach demonstrates a failure to implement such measures, as a technical error allowed unauthorized access.

4. The breach involved the disclosure of financial information and national identification numbers (CNP), which are sensitive personal data that require heightened protection. While not explicitly listed under Article 9, the national identification number is considered an identifier of general application under Article 87, requiring appropriate safeguards, which were not maintained.

5. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The unauthorized disclosure constitutes a violation of this integrity and confidentiality principle.

6. Although the controller notified the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 33, which is compliant with that specific obligation, the breach itself indicates noncompliance with the broader security obligations under Articles 5 and 32.

7. Given the nature of the data disclosed (including financial details and national identifiers), the breach was likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, yet there is no indication that the controller communicated the breach to the affected data subjects as required under Article 34(1).

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to failures in implementing appropriate security measures under Articles 5 and 32, and potentially failing to notify data subjects under Article 34 where required."
"Muxers Concept, S.L., the data controller, is the owner of a restaurant. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, the Judicial Police and the Spanish DPA received numerous complaints by employees of the restaurant, the data subjects, related to the discovery of hidden and operational audio and video recording systems in the company's toilet as well as changing and locker rooms. In the following investigation, the public entities were able to collect evidence of the hidden devices.

Following further investigations, the DPA considers it undisputed at the time of the proceedings at hand that the data controller engaged in video and audio surveillance of its employees and costumers since 2018.

While the controller informed its employees that their images, captured by video cameras, could be used to comply with labour laws, neither the employees nor the controller's costumers were informed of the hidden audio recordings.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 83","1. The case involves Muxers Concept, S.L. as a data controller processing personal data of employees and customers through audio and video recordings, which falls under the territorial scope of the GDPR as per Article 3, since the controller is established in the EU and processing occurs in the context of its activities.

2. The controller installed hidden audio and video recording systems in toilets, changing rooms, and locker rooms, which are sensitive areas. This processing violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the hidden nature of the recordings, especially for audio, means data subjects were not aware of the processing, making it unfair and non-transparent.

3. For the processing to be lawful under Article 6, it must have a valid legal basis. The controller claimed video recordings were for compliance with labor laws, but surveillance in private areas is disproportionate and not necessary for that purpose. Audio recordings lacked any justification, and consent was not obtained, violating Article 6.

4. The recordings in private areas likely capture special categories of personal data, such as health information or intimate details, which are prohibited under Article 9 unless an exception applies. No exception, such as explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a), is present, thus violating Article 9.

5. The controller failed to provide information to data subjects about the processing of personal data, as required by Article 13. While employees were informed about video recordings, they were not informed about audio recordings, breaching the right to be informed under Article 13(1) and (2).

6. The processing also violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as recording in toilets and changing rooms is excessive and not limited to what is necessary for the stated purposes.

7. Given the high-risk nature of surveillance in sensitive areas, the controller should have conducted a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) under Article 35, but there is no indication that this was done, leading to a violation.

8. The hidden recordings infringe on the data subjects' rights to privacy and data protection, and the controller did not implement appropriate measures to ensure compliance, violating the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

9. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 5, 6, 9, 13, and 35, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Agency of Family Law (the controller) is a public authority that handles cases relating to family issues, including i.a. separation and divorce, guardianship, adoption, child/spousal support, etc. On 13 October 2021, following its March decision 2020-432-0037, the Danish DPA opened another investigation into the controller's disclosures of protected name and address information to unauthorised parties. The inspection covered 37 personal data security breaches from 27 May 2021 to 16 August 2022, where the controller accidentally shared protected information about one party to a proceeding with another party. In those cases, parties protected their contact details precisely to avoid the other party getting to know their whereabouts, e.g. due to concerns about child abduction, violence, etc.

The disclosures happened mainly because of a human error when responding to information access requests, information letters, party hearings and sending decisions. Case handlers would not pay enough attention to the information and thereby did not anonymise it. The controller emphasised that it processes thousands of cases each year. Despite the strong focus on avoiding accidental disclosure of personal data and continuous work to improve data security, human errors can occur when employees perform their job. These errors can, unfortunately, lead to breaches of personal data security.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 58","1. The Agency of Family Law is a public authority acting as a data controller processing personal data related to family law cases, including sensitive information about parties involved in proceedings (Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'personal data').

2. The controller processed special categories of personal data including information that could reveal details about individuals' whereabouts potentially related to safety concerns (e.g., risks of violence or child abduction), which falls under sensitive data processing requiring enhanced protections (Article 9(1)).

3. The controller experienced 37 personal data security breaches where protected information was disclosed to unauthorized parties, violating the fundamental principle of integrity and confidentiality requiring appropriate security of personal data (Article 5(1)(f)).

4. The breaches resulted from human errors during routine operations (responding to access requests, sending decisions, etc.), indicating insufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the high risks presented by this processing, particularly given the sensitive nature of the data and potential consequences for data subjects (Article 32(1)).

5. Despite the controller's claim of ""continuous work to improve data security,"" the recurring nature of the breaches (37 incidents over 15 months) demonstrates that the implemented measures were not effective in preventing unauthorized disclosures, failing to meet the accountability principle (Article 5(2)).

6. The controller failed to implement adequate data protection by design and by default measures, such as automated systems or additional verification steps that could have prevented human errors from resulting in data breaches (Article 25(1) and (2)).

7. The processing operations involved regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale (thousands of cases annually) with high risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms, yet the controller appears to have insufficient safeguards in place despite these known risks (Article 35(1) and (3)).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of the GDPR's core principles regarding data security, accountability, and protection of sensitive personal data."
"The customer database of a Romanian publisher (the controller) was posted on an online forum, resulting in a data breach. The database included the name, phone number, email address, encrypted passwords and IP addresses corresponding to 10.739 of the controller's customers (the data subject's) between 2019-2021.

The controller had a second data breach that occurred due to a ransomware attack. The incident led to unauthorised access to and loss of personal data belonging to approximately 100 data subjects (the controller's employees and partners).

Following the two data breaches, the controller notified the Romanian DPA. After the notification, the DPA started an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a Romanian publisher acting as a data controller processing personal data of customers and employees, which falls under the territorial scope of the GDPR as per Article 3, since the controller is established in the EU (Romania).

2. The controller experienced two data breaches: first, a customer database containing personal data (names, phone numbers, email addresses, encrypted passwords, and IP addresses) was posted online; second, a ransomware attack led to unauthorized access and loss of personal data of employees and partners. These incidents constitute personal data breaches as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Under Article 32, the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The occurrence of two breaches, including one due to ransomware, indicates a failure to implement such measures, violating Article 32.

4. Article 33 requires the controller to notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. While the controller notified the Romanian DPA, the breach involving the customer database occurred between 2019-2021, suggesting possible delays in detection or notification, which may violate the timely notification requirement.

5. Article 34 requires the controller to communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The exposure of sensitive information like encrypted passwords and IP addresses could pose such risks, and there is no indication in the case that the controller communicated the breach to the affected data subjects, potentially violating Article 34.

6. Article 5(1)(f) mandates that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The breaches demonstrate a failure to comply with this integrity and confidentiality principle.

7. Article 24 requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR. The recurrence of breaches suggests insufficient measures and a lack of accountability.

8. The controller's failure to prevent unauthorized access and loss of personal data through adequate security measures, as required by Articles 32 and 5(1)(f), and potential failures in breach notification and communication under Articles 33 and 34, lead to a conclusion of noncompliance.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"An application of Bitfactor (the controller) that sent marketing communications to users of its website malfunctioned. This resulted in a data breach affecting 1757 users of the controller's website (the data subjects). The press release does not indicate which personal data was involved and what happened to it, other than that it was a 'breach of confidentiality.'

The controller notified the Romanian DPA of the data breach. Following the notification, the DPA started an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves Bitfactor as the controller and 1757 users as data subjects, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, since it involves processing of personal data by automated means.

2. The controller experienced a data breach described as a ""breach of confidentiality"" affecting 1757 users, indicating a failure to maintain the security and confidentiality of personal data as required by Article 5(1)(f), which mandates that personal data must be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.""

3. Article 32 requires controllers to ""implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,"" taking into account factors like the state of the art and costs of implementation. The malfunction in the marketing application suggests inadequate security measures were in place.

4. While the controller notified the Romanian DPA of the breach as required by Article 33, the mere occurrence of a confidentiality breach indicates a failure to meet the security obligations under Articles 5 and 32.

5. The breach of confidentiality specifically violates the integrity and confidentiality principle in Article 5(1)(f), as personal data was not properly protected against unauthorized access or disclosure.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"On 1 October 2021, the Icelandic DPA received a complaint from the father of a child. The child is the relevant data subject in the case at hand. The complaint alleged that the principal of the data subject's school deliberately entered the wrong attendance record. It was alleged that this was done to influence proceedings in a visitation case, where the parents of the data subject were engaged in court proceedings against each other. The complaint also stated that the principal was related to the mother of the data subject and that the attendance record was corrected by the school only after it was pointed out by the father.

In its reply to the DPA, the school stated that the wrongful entry in the attendance record had been done by mistake. The school stated that access to attendance records is restricted and only the supervising teacher, office manager, and the principal have access. It was also stated that the attendance record was corrected as soon as it was brought to the notice of the school.  The school stated that logs of all actions on the attendance systems are maintained and a monthly report is sent out to parents so that they can comment on the registration of attendance concerning their child.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves processing of personal data (attendance records) by a school, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the policy, as it determines the purposes and means of processing student attendance data.

2. The policy requires personal data to be ""accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date"" under Article 5(1)(d), and every reasonable step must be taken to ensure inaccurate data are erased or rectified without delay.

3. The case describes a situation where the school principal entered incorrect attendance data, which constitutes a violation of the accuracy principle under Article 5(1)(d), regardless of whether it was intentional or mistaken.

4. Under Article 16, the data subject has the right to obtain rectification of inaccurate personal data without undue delay. While the school corrected the record after being notified, the initial inaccuracy and the need for external intervention to identify and correct it demonstrates a failure in the controller's obligation to maintain accurate data.

5. The policy under Article 24 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, including measures to ensure ongoing accuracy of personal data. The school's system allowing such incorrect entries suggests inadequate measures to ensure data accuracy.

6. While the school maintained access restrictions and logs (potentially complying with security requirements under Article 32), these measures did not prevent the accuracy violation from occurring.

7. The case involves processing of a child's data, which requires particular care under the policy, though no specific child data provisions were directly violated in this instance.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of the accuracy principle under Article 5(1)(d) and the right to rectification under Article 16, as the controller failed to maintain accurate personal data and required external intervention to correct inaccuracies."
"The data subject submitted an access request Article 15 GDPR for his two accounts to the controller’s customer service department. The controller verified the data subject’s identity and informed him that his request would be followed up with a view to obtaining a copy of his personal data within one month. These initial exchanges of e-mails took place with the controller using a .be (Belgium) e-mail address.

The data subject sent a reminder to the controller on 4 November 2019 after he hadn’t heard back from the controller. The Data subject received an email on 7 November 2019 from the privacy team of the controller using a privacy@[...].uk (United Kingdom) e-mail address. In this e-mail, it was stated that all the personal data of the data subject had been deleted following its request for deletion. On the same day, 7 November 2019, the data subject objected by e-mail that he had not requested the deletion of personal data but access to personal data. According to the data subject, the controller didn't answer this e-mail.

After the data subject filed his complaint which was deemed admissible by the Belgian DPA, the DPA ordered an investigation into the matter. In its investigation report, it held the following:

The controller's Belgian company was jointly responsible for the processing with the controllers UK company. This joint responsibility results from the privacy policy, available on the website of the Belgian company of the controller. The investigation unit also held that the controller violated Article 12(1) GDPR, Article 12(2) GDPR, Article 15(1) GDPR and Article 15(3) GDPR. The controller had deleted the data of the data subject instead of providing access to the data. The controller stated that this was most likely caused by human error. To prevent the problem from occurring in the future, the controller started putting in place additional training and automated processed to handle requests of data subjects under the GDPR in a better way.

The DPA held that the investigations unit didn’t answer the question which DPA was the lead supervisory authority. The controller stated in its privacy-policy that a complaint could be filed at either the DPA in the UK or the Belgium DPA.

The DPA reiterated that after Brexit, each Member State in which a new principal place of business of the controller was established, would become the DPA including for complaints against the controller, after the DPA in the UK had left the cooperation mechanism and the one-stop shop. In the absence of a principal place of business in the EU of the controller (Article 56(1) GDPR), every DPA of the other EU members states have jurisdiction regarding the controller insofar as the GDPR applies.

There was no agreement between the controller's companies in Belgium and the UK regarding joint controllership.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 12, Article 15, Article 26, Article 56","1. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15 GDPR by submitting a request to the controller's customer service department. The controller initially acknowledged this request and committed to providing the information within one month, which aligns with the time frame specified in Article 12(3) GDPR.

2. However, instead of providing access to the personal data as required by Article 15(1) and (3) GDPR, the controller erroneously deleted all of the data subject's personal data. This action constitutes a failure to comply with the data subject's access request and violates Article 15 GDPR.

3. The controller's failure to provide the requested information and its incorrect deletion of data also violates Article 12(1) and (2) GDPR, which require the controller to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and to provide information on action taken without undue delay. The controller did not rectify this error upon the data subject's objection on 7 November 2019, further exacerbating the violation.

4. The investigation revealed that the controller's Belgian and UK companies were joint controllers, as indicated by the privacy policy on the Belgian company's website. However, there was no agreement between these entities outlining their respective responsibilities for compliance with GDPR obligations, as required by Article 26(1) GDPR. This lack of a transparent arrangement constitutes a violation of Article 26.

5. Post-Brexit, the UK supervisory authority is no longer part of the EU's one-stop-shop mechanism under Chapter VII GDPR. Since the controller does not have a main establishment in the EU (as the UK is no longer a Member State), the Belgian DPA has jurisdiction over the processing activities related to data subjects in Belgium, pursuant to Article 55(1) GDPR. The controller's privacy policy inaccurately suggested that complaints could be filed with either the UK or Belgian DPA, which is noncompliant with the post-Brexit supervisory authority structure.

6. The controller's claim that the deletion was due to human error does not absolve it of liability. Under Article 5(2) GDPR (the accountability principle), the controller is responsible for ensuring compliance and must demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation. The implementation of additional training and automated processes is a remedial measure but does not rectify the initial violation.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 12(1), Article 12(2), Article 15, and Article 26 GDPR."
"In the first place, the data subject submitted a claim against their former employer company (the controller) for an illegal communication of their previous trade union membership data. Specifically, the controller sent to the CGT Union a registered mail explaining that the data subject had been a worker representative in another Union (Sindicato Unitario de Huelva) and that could lead to an incompatibility with their current nomination in CGT Union.

Additionally, the data subject claimed that their union membership and other data were also shared to the media since there were some news about their dismissal. In this regard, the data subject presented a letter sent by the controller stating that “[Data subject’s] disciplinary dismissal was prior to their nomination by CGT Union as company’s union section secretary, since the data subject was a member of Sindicato Unitario de Huelva when dismissed”.

Furthermore, it was published in another medium that the data subject was dismissed on disciplinary grounds.

Considering the above, the Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding and notified the controller, who claimed that the communication of the union membership data was carried out in a common context of legal cooperation between the controller and the workers who make use of their right to freedom of union. The mention of the data subject in this interaction was allegedly due to their relation with both unions and the company, and that information shared had direct effect to the right to freedom of union.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of trade union membership data, which qualifies as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, as it reveals trade union membership.

2. The controller (employer) processed this special category data by communicating it to another trade union (CGT Union) and potentially to media outlets, as evidenced by the published news about the data subject's dismissal and union affiliations.

3. Processing of special category data is prohibited under Article 9(1) unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller claimed the processing was necessary for ""legal cooperation between the controller and the workers"" relating to ""freedom of union,"" but no specific exception under Article 9(2) is met:
   - There is no evidence of explicit consent from the data subject (Article 9(2)(a)).
   - The processing was not necessary for obligations under employment law (Article 9(2)(b)), as the communication was not mandated by law.
   - The processing was not necessary to protect vital interests (Article 9(2)(c)) or for legal claims (Article 9(2)(f)), as the controller's actions were proactive communications rather than defensive measures.
   - The controller did not demonstrate that the processing was necessary for reasons of substantial public interest (Article 9(2)(g)) or for archiving/research purposes (Article 9(2)(j)).

4. The processing also violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 6(1), as no lawful basis (e.g., consent, legal obligation, legitimate interests) is justified for disclosing union membership data to third parties without necessity.

5. The controller failed to ensure transparency and purpose limitation under Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b), as the disclosure of union membership data to media outlets exceeded the original purpose of employment-related processing.

6. The controller did not implement appropriate safeguards under Article 9(2) to protect the data subject's fundamental rights, as the disclosure was not proportionate or necessary for the claimed purpose of ""legal cooperation.""

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically violating Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b), 6(1), and 9(1)."
"The controller is a catalogue retailer that sells health related services and products. The DPA started to investigate the controller after it came across it during another investigation.

In its investigation into the controller, the DPA found that between August 2019 and 19 August 2020, when a customer purchased a ""trigger product"" from the controller, it would make assumptions about customers' medical conditions and then market health-related products to them without their consent. the controller linked the trigger products to several health conditions which Easylife inferred that the customer was likely to have. After this, the controller would trigger marketing calls through a third party telemarketing provider based on the transaction data. Overall, the incident affected 145,400 data subjects. Their personal data would include their names, telephone numbers, and special categories of data.

For the processing, the controller relied on its own legitimate interests for the processing, such as 'to store the information' and 'to maintain it as evidence'. Data subjects were not involved that their personal data would be used for profiling.

The DPA became concerned that using transaction data to make inferences about health conditions could constitute profiling, and the inferences made about health conditions could indicate processing of special category data.

In the representations, the controller argued that it had acquired the requisite consent to process special category data because it had notified customers that it would be using their personal data to notify them of products ""that might be of interest'.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13","1. The controller processed special categories of personal data (health-related inferences) without a valid lawful basis under Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless an exception applies. The controller claimed consent under Article 9(2)(a), but the generic notification about products ""that might be of interest"" did not meet the standard for explicit consent, as it failed to specifically identify the processing of health data or the purpose of profiling for medical condition inferences.

2. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) for processing, but this basis is insufficient for special category data under Article 9. Additionally, the balancing test required for legitimate interests likely failed, as the intrusive profiling of health conditions without transparency overrode the data subjects' interests and fundamental rights.

3. The controller engaged in profiling under Article 4(4) by analyzing purchase data to infer health conditions, but failed to provide meaningful information about the logic involved or the significance of such processing, as required by Article 13(2)(f) and Article 14(2)(g) when personal data are collected from or about the data subject.

4. The controller violated transparency obligations under Articles 13 and 14 by not informing data subjects that their transaction data would be used to infer health conditions and trigger marketing calls. The generic reference to products ""that might be of interest"" was insufficiently specific about the purposes and means of processing.

5. The processing violated the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the controller concealed the true nature of the profiling and its reliance on sensitive health inferences. It also breached purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b) by using purchase data for unrelated profiling purposes without appropriate justification.

6. The involvement of a third-party telemarketer without ensuring compliant transfers or processing arrangements may violate Articles 28 and 44, though the primary issue remains the unlawful initial processing.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The complainant  requested erasure under Article 17 GDPR. It took two months before they received a reply from the controller. After two months, the data subject received a reply which stated that her request will be handled but that her request for erasure may take another 90 days to be completed. The complainant considered it unreasonable that it takes a total of five months for the controller to handle her request.

The controller stated that the initial delays were due to issues on its side in verifying the data subject's identity. The erasure was delayed due to lower staffing during the Christmas and New Year holidays. The controller holds that it has handled the complainants request without undue delay considering the Christmas and New Year holidays and the individual error concerning the confirmation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 17, Article 58","1. The case involves a data subject requesting erasure under Article 17 GDPR and a controller's response timeline that exceeds the permitted timeframe under GDPR regulations.

2. According to Article 12(3) GDPR, the controller must provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15-22 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.

3. The controller in this case took two months to provide an initial response to the erasure request, which exceeds the one-month timeframe stipulated in Article 12(3).

4. Article 12(3) allows for extending the response period by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of requests, but requires that the controller must inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request.

5. The controller failed to notify the data subject of any extension within the initial one-month period as required by Article 12(3).

6. The controller's stated reasons for delay (identity verification issues and lower staffing during holidays) do not constitute valid justifications under GDPR for exceeding the response timelines, as the regulation places the burden on the controller to implement proper procedures to handle requests promptly.

7. The controller's additional statement that the erasure would take another 90 days (approximately three months) would result in a total processing time of approximately five months, which far exceeds the maximum permitted timeframe of three months (one initial month plus two month extension) under Article 12(3).

8. Therefore, the case demonstrates multiple violations of Article 12(3) GDPR regarding the timing requirements for responding to data subject requests.

9. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The controller was a photographer who offered photoshoots in the area of youth sports. In 2018, he provided preview pictures taken as the official photographer at an international water diving competition in Croatia on their website.  A total of 16,392 pictures of the participating children and adolescents (data subjects), aged 6-18, were offered for sale on the website between 12 July 2018 and 7 September 2021. The photos could be categorised on the controller's website specific to each subcategories of the participants ""Boy A"" ""Girl B"" etc. The photos could be bought individually by any person without registration either for private or editorial use, as a digital download, CD or on a USB stick. The data subjects depicted in the photos and their legal guardians had not consented to the publication and sale of the photos by the controller.

A complaint was filed pursuant of Article 77 GDPR. In the following Article 60 GDPR procedure, the Berlin DPA was the lead supervisory authority (LSA) with the Croatian DPA as a CSA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves a controller (the photographer) processing personal data (photographs) of children and adolescents aged 6-18 without their consent or that of their legal guardians, which violates the general principles of lawfulness under Article 6(1) of the GDPR, as no lawful basis for processing (such as consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests) has been established or justified in this context.

2. The photographs constitute biometric data under Article 4(14) GDPR, as they allow for the unique identification of natural persons, and may also reveal special categories of personal data such as racial or ethnic origin under Article 9(1). Processing such data is prohibited unless an exception under Article 9(2) applies. Here, no exception is met, as explicit consent was not obtained (Article 9(2)(a)), and no other applicable exception (e.g., vital interests, public interest, or legal claims) is present.

3. For children under the age of 16, Article 8(1) requires that processing based on consent be given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility. The controller failed to obtain such consent or authorization, thereby violating Article 8(1) and the associated conditions for lawful processing of children's data.

4. The controller did not provide the required information to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, such as the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, and data subject rights, which is necessary for fair and transparent processing under Article 5(1)(a).

5. The processing for commercial sale of photographs without consent infringes on the data subjects' rights under Articles 15-22, including the right to access (Article 15), rectification (Article 16), erasure (Article 17), and objection (Article 21), as the controller did not facilitate these rights or provide mechanisms for their exercise.

6. The lead supervisory authority (Berlin DPA) and concerned supervisory authority (Croatian DPA) determined noncompliance through the Article 60 procedure, confirming violations of multiple GDPR provisions, including those related to lawfulness, special data categories, children's data, and transparency obligations.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The data subject submitted a claim against an insurance company (the controller) for allowing changes to their health insurance policy. The insurance policy was initially signed in 2016 and linked to the data subject as policyholder as well as the owner of the bank account from which the insurance premiums were paid. However, the insured person was their former partner.

In June 2021, the data subject’s former partner submitted a request to change the health insurance policy data, which was done by the bank (the processor). The data changed were the policyholder name and the bank account to which the insurance premiums were associated, allowing the data subject’s former partner to pay the insurance fees themselves. These changes were made without the consent of the data subject.

After a first complaint by the data subject to the processor, the data subject was included as the insurance holder again. After a further complaint, their bank account number was restored.

In August 2022, the Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the controller, which allowed to hear the claims from the involved parties. Both the controller and the processor claimed to have obtained implicit consent from the data subject since their initial wish was to cover their partner and that, by losing their status as insurance holder, their obligations were lifted, which was considered a presumed benefit for the data subject.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 83","1. The case involves a data subject (policyholder) and an insurance company (controller) with a bank acting as processor, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as it involves processing of personal data by automated means (Article 2).

2. The controller processed personal data (policyholder name and bank account details) without obtaining proper consent from the data subject, violating the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and the specific requirement for explicit consent under Article 6(1)(a) when consent is used as the legal basis for processing.

3. The controller and processor claimed ""implicit consent"" based on the data subject's initial wish to cover their partner, but Article 4 defines consent as requiring ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication"" through ""clear affirmative action,"" which was not obtained for the specific processing operation (the policy changes in June 2021).

4. Article 7(1) requires controllers to be able to demonstrate valid consent, which the controller failed to do since no explicit consent was obtained for the changes made to the policyholder information and bank account details.

5. The processor (bank) implemented processing changes without proper instructions from the controller or valid legal basis, violating Article 28(3)(a) which requires processors to act only on documented instructions from the controller.

6. The processing operation involved special category data (health insurance information) under Article 9(1), which requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) for processing, which was not obtained.

7. The controller violated the accountability principle under Article 5(2) by failing to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles, particularly regarding the lawfulness of processing and obtaining proper consent.

8. The case represents a failure in the controller-processor relationship under Article 28, as the processor executed processing operations without proper authorization and the controller failed to ensure the processor adhered to GDPR requirements.

9. Therefore, based on violations of Articles 5, 6, 7, 9, and 28 of the GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject submitted a complaint against a training academy (the controller) for unlawfully publishing their personal data on a website. The publication contained results of a selection process in which the data subject participated. Specifically, the document contained a list with names, last names, anonymised ID numbers and categories assigned to participants. The list allowed the identification of health data relating to disabilities.

In addition, the list corresponded with the provisional publication of results by the Galician Health Services (SERGAS), the authority competent for the examination and selection of candidates. Both lists were different, thus the controller made a re-work of the official list by selecting some candidates, grouping them by categories, breaking down their marks (studies, work experience, other activities) and assigning them a position according to their total score.

The Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the controller due to an alleged violation of Article 6(1) GDPR for the lack of legal basis for processing of personal data, including special categories of personal data. Furthermore, the publication allegedly did not include the mandatory information regarding the origin of the data nor the right to object.

In response, the controller argued that the legal basis was legitimate interest since the academy offered training courses and the publication showed the participants, in a clear way, the position obtained. The controller stated that it was not processing carried out in the context of their usual activity since it was done only once, in relation with that specific selection process. Another argument was that the information had been made public by SERGAS and that candidates who participated in the public selection process expected their data to be published due to transparency obligations.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, including special categories of data (health data relating to disabilities), by a training academy (the controller) through publication on a website, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of processing and personal data).

2. The processing of special categories of personal data, such as health data, is prohibited under Article 9(1) unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller argued that the data was already public by SERGAS, but Article 9(2)(e) requires that the data be ""manifestly made public by the data subject,"" which was not the case here as the publication was by a public authority, not the data subjects themselves. Therefore, no exception under Article 9(2) is applicable, making the processing unlawful.

3. The controller claimed legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) as the legal basis. However, for legitimate interest to apply, the controller must demonstrate that their interests override the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. The publication included detailed breakdowns of scores and categories, which goes beyond mere transparency and could lead to identification of health data, violating the data subjects' rights to privacy and data protection. This fails the balancing test required by Article 6(1)(f).

4. Additionally, the controller failed to provide the mandatory information required under Articles 13 and 14. Since the data was not obtained directly from the data subjects, Article 14 applies, requiring the controller to inform data subjects about the source of the data and their right to object, among other things. The controller did not provide this information, thus violating transparency obligations.

5. The publication allowed identification of health data, which is a special category under Article 9, and the controller did not have a valid legal basis under Article 6 or an exception under Article 9, making the processing unlawful.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 6(1) (lack of lawful basis), Article 9 (processing of special data without exception), and Articles 13/14 (lack of transparency)."
"The controller took over a business unit of Company XX including existing contracts. The data subjects previously consented to the processing of his personal data by company XX.

One data subject stated that he had received electronic payment invoices from the controller, without ever having a contractual relationship with it. It complained about this fact at the controller. After this, the data subject submitted an access request to discover the origin of his personal data and the other information stated in Article 13 GDPR. The data subject didn’t receive an answer within the time limits set in Article 12(3) GDPR. The data subject filed a complaint at the DPA because of this lack of an answer.

However, the controller stated that it deleted the data subject’s personal data after the data subject complained about receiving the electronic payment invoices. The controller stated that it later informed all customers of company XX about the acquisition by the controller. The controller discovered only after the complaint of the data subject at the DPA that his Pec-address (certified e-mail) was missing because of prior deletion.

The controller stated that the obligation to provide information to data subjects did not exist if the purpose of the processing remained unchanged after the acquisition. The controller stated that it had agreed with company XX that the processing would continue on the same terms, in compliance for the purposes for which the data had been collected, using with the same methods. The controller also held that it didn’t need new consent from data subjects for the same reason.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 14, Article 15","1. The controller acquired personal data from Company XX as part of a business unit acquisition, making the controller a new data processor for these records under Article 4(7) (definition of controller).

2. Under Article 14(1), where personal data have not been obtained directly from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information including its identity, the source of the data, and the purposes of processing. The controller failed to provide this information to the data subject upon acquisition.

3. The data subject submitted an access request under Article 15, which requires the controller to provide information about the processing of their personal data. The controller failed to respond within the one-month timeframe specified in Article 12(3), constituting a violation.

4. The controller's claim that information obligations did not apply because processing purposes remained unchanged is incorrect. Article 14(3) requires providing information ""within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, but at the latest within one month,"" regardless of purpose continuity.

5. The controller's deletion of data after the complaint does not remedy the prior violations of Articles 12(3), 14, and 15. The obligation to respond to access requests exists independently of subsequent data deletion.

6. The controller's argument about maintaining the same terms of processing does not override the specific information obligations under Chapter III (Rights of the data subject), particularly Articles 12-15.

7. Therefore, the case involves multiple violations of GDPR provisions including:
   - Article 12(3) (failure to respond to access request timely)
   - Article 14 (failure to provide information where data not obtained from data subject)
   - Article 15 (failure to provide access to personal data)

8. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The local police of Milan received a complaint about a video surveillance system installed in a building owned by Immobiliare Ricostruzione Meloria s.r.l. (controller). The police investigated the matter and drew up a report. Based on this report, the Italian DPA opened an investigation into the controller.

The controller allegedly installed the system at the request of some tenants of the building. The system consisted of four cameras: one filming the entrance, one the space in front of the lift, and two others facing the backyard, the cellars and a flat. The images taken by the cameras were displayed on a monitor and stored on a recording device, both located in the porter's lodge.

The only information concerning the video surveillance system which passer-bys received consisted of a sign with a figure of a stylised camera placed on the left-hand side of the entrance door to the building. No further information about the processing activity or the data controller was provided, not even on the premises of the porter's lodge.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13","1. The case involves processing of personal data through a video surveillance system installed by Immobiliare Ricostruzione Meloria s.r.l. (controller), which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to provide adequate information to data subjects (passers-by and individuals filmed) as required by Article 13, which mandates that where personal data are collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information including: the identity and contact details of the controller (Article 13(1)(a)), the purposes of processing (Article 13(1)(c)), the legal basis for processing (Article 13(1)(c)), and other necessary information to ensure fair and transparent processing.

3. The only information provided was a sign with a stylized camera figure, which does not fulfill any of the requirements under Article 13. Specifically, it lacks: the controller's identity, processing purposes, legal basis, data retention periods (Article 13(2)(a)), data subject rights (Article 13(2)(b)), and other mandatory elements.

4. The information provided also fails to meet the standards of Article 12, which requires that information be provided in a ""concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language."" A generic camera symbol without explanatory text does not satisfy this requirement.

5. The processing involves monitoring of common areas (entrance, lift area, backyard, cellars, and a flat), which likely captures images of individuals who are not tenants (e.g., visitors, delivery persons), but no information was provided to these data subjects about the processing, violating their rights under Articles 13 and 14 (where data are not obtained directly from the data subject).

6. The lack of proper information provision impedes data subjects' ability to exercise their rights under Articles 15-22 (e.g., right of access, rectification, erasure), as they cannot identify the controller or understand the processing purposes, contrary to Article 12(2) which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.

7. The controller did not demonstrate compliance with the principle of transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), as data subjects were not adequately informed about the processing, and the principle of accountability (Article 5(2)), as the controller failed to implement appropriate measures to provide required information.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the Regulation due to multiple violations of information obligations under Articles 12, 13, and 14, and principles of transparency and accountability under Article 5."
"The controller operates a facial recognition tool (the tool) to identify data subjects using pictures and video's posted online (online content). The controller is established in the United States and has no establishment in the European Union (EU), but processes personal data of EU data subjects. Specifically, it collects online content in which faces appear, including faces of minors.

The tool indexes freely accessible web pages and social media platforms. After the indexing, the tool extracts all images with faces of data subjects. Based on these images, the tool calculates a mathematical hash for each data subject, which is in turn based on a unique biometric template of the face in the picture. The mathematical hash is used to make data subjects searchable in the database.

The controller sells access to its database to third parties. These third parties can upload a picture of a face to start a search in order to identify data subject, after which the tool creates a mathematical hash for this uploaded picture. This new hash is compared with existing hashes in the database. When the hashes are similar, the tool collects all the images with the same hash, including a reference to the original source of each picture. This process makes it possible to identify data subjects.

In its privacy policy, the controller stated that data subjects could only exercise their right of access twice a year. The controller did not mention a retention period for the personal data.

The DPA received several complaints from data subjects regarding the rights of access (Article 15 GDPR) and erasure (Article 17 GDPR) between May and December 2020. One data subject requested a third party to make an access request on her behalf. The controller acknowledged that it had received this request and invited the data subject to use an online platform to exercise her right of access, but failed to answer follow up requests on multiple occasions. When answering to the last request, the controller also asked for the submission of a photograph and ID card and repeated the invitation to use an online platform to exercise the right of access. After 4 months and 7 letters, the controller provided access for this data subject. Another data subject had complained that it had submitted an request for erasure (Article 17 GDPR), but had never received an answer form the controller. The DPA started an investigation following these complaints.

During the investigation, on 26 November 2021, the DPA also ordered the controller to comply with several GDPR Articles. The controller did not provide a response. The investigation was concluded on 14 July 2022, to which the controller did not react either.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17, Article 32, Article 9","1. The controller is established outside the EU (United States) but processes personal data of EU data subjects through its facial recognition tool that monitors their behavior by indexing online content including social media platforms, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR pursuant to Article 3(2)(b) as the processing activities are related to the monitoring of data subjects' behavior within the Union.

2. The controller processes biometric data (facial images and derived mathematical hashes based on unique biometric templates) for the purpose of uniquely identifying natural persons, which qualifies as special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), requiring explicit consent or other specific lawful bases under Article 9(2). The controller processes this data without obtaining explicit consent or meeting any exception under Article 9(2), thereby violating the prohibition on processing special categories of data.

3. The controller fails to provide transparent information about processing activities as required by Articles 13 and 14, particularly by not specifying a retention period for personal data (violating Article 13(2)(a) and Article 14(2)(a)) and imposing an unlawful limitation on the right of access (only twice per year) contrary to Article 12(3) which requires controllers to facilitate data subject rights without undue delay.

4. The controller violates Article 15 (right of access) by failing to respond promptly to access requests - taking 4 months and 7 letters to provide access to one data subject despite Article 12(3) requiring responses within one month (extendable by two months where necessary). The requirement to submit a photograph and ID card exceeds the permissible identity verification under Article 12(6) which only allows additional information where reasonable doubts exist about the requester's identity.

5. The controller violates Article 17 (right to erasure) by not responding to erasure requests, failing to fulfill its obligation to erase personal data without undue delay when no lawful basis for processing exists, particularly given the sensitive nature of the biometric data being processed.

6. The controller engages in international transfers of personal data by selling database access to third parties without ensuring adequate safeguards as required by Chapter V (Articles 44-49), particularly where third parties may be located in countries without adequacy decisions.

7. The controller fails to cooperate with the supervisory authority during its investigation, violating Article 31 which requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request, and ignores legally binding orders from the DPA issued on 26 November 2021, contrary to the corrective powers of supervisory authorities under Article 58(2).

8. The processing operations involve large-scale systematic monitoring of data subjects and processing of special category data, requiring a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(3)(a) and (b), which the controller apparently failed to conduct.

9. The controller violates the principle of accountability under Article 5(2) by failing to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, including lawfulness, fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), and storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)).

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"SmartResponse A/S (the controller) offers online marketing solutions for advertisers. It, among others, processes personal data of participants in Internet competitions. In order to sign up for an Internet competition, participants have to give consent for the controller to process information about them and to pass it on to the controller's business partners. In the present case, the collected data included e-mail addresses, gender, IP addresses, date of birth, telephone numbers and postal addresses of the participants.

Following an inquiry from the Consumer Ombudsman and a number of complaints from concerned data subjects, the Danish DPA initiated an investigation into the controller's processing of personal data. The procedure concerned i.a. the disclosure of personal data in connection with the offering of Internet competitions and questionnaires used in that context. In April 2020, the DPA sent a request to the controller asking to provide information on its processing activities, followed by several requests for additional clarification. Based on this, the DPA assessed the legal basis for processing, the retention periods and the information provided to data subjects on processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 58","1. The case involves SmartResponse A/S as a data controller processing personal data (email addresses, gender, IP addresses, date of birth, telephone numbers, and postal addresses) of competition participants, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1).

2. The controller required participants to give consent for processing and sharing their data with business partners as a condition for entering competitions. According to Article 7(4), when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account must be taken of whether the performance of a contract (here, participation in competitions) is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for that contract. Since participation in competitions does not inherently require data sharing with third parties, this practice violates the requirement for freely given consent.

3. The information provided to data subjects about the processing activities was insufficient. Articles 13 and 14 require controllers to provide specific information about processing purposes, legal basis, data recipients, and other details. The Danish DPA's investigation revealed deficiencies in this information, particularly regarding the disclosure of data to business partners, which violates the transparency principles in Articles 12-14.

4. The controller's processing lacked a valid legal basis under Article 6. Since the consent was not freely given (as established in point 2), it cannot serve as a valid legal basis under Article 6(1)(a). No other legal basis under Article 6 appears applicable to this processing.

5. The processing likely violated the purpose limitation principle in Article 5(1)(b), as data collected for competition participation was further processed for marketing purposes (sharing with business partners) without a separate legal basis or proper information to data subjects.

6. The investigation revealed issues with retention periods. Article 5(1)(e) requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with this storage limitation principle.

7. The case involves processing of special categories of data (potentially revealing racial or ethnic origin through IP addresses or other data) without meeting any of the exceptions under Article 9(2), further compounding the compliance failures.

8. Based on the Danish DPA's investigation and the violations of multiple provisions including Articles 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 14, the controller's processing operations were not conducted in accordance with the Regulation.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Tet (the controller) is an internet service provider which also offers additional services in the telecommunications and entertainment sectors. The Latvian DPA started an ex officio investigation into the controller's data processing practices. Specifically, it looked into the transfers of customers' (data subjects) data to out-of-court debt recovery service providers. The controller claimed that these transfers were carried out for the purpose of, among others, checking the solvency of data subjects when preparing a contract.

In the course of the investigation, the DPA found that the solvency checks with a debt recovery service happened without prior identity checks of the data subjects. In one case, because the controller had not verified the accuracy of the information provided by a customer, personal data of a minor was transferred to the debt recovery service.

On 15 July 2022, the DPA issued the original decision imposing the fine. On 2 August 2022, it received the controller's request for an oral hearing to express that the fine, among others, was disproportionate and not accurate, in addition to the proceedings before the DPA exceeding the time limits and allegedly not allowing the controller to exercise its rights.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves Tet as a data controller processing personal data of its customers, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, since it involves automated processing of personal data by an internet service provider.

2. The controller transferred personal data to debt recovery service providers without prior identity verification of data subjects, violating the principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d), which requires that personal data be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, with every reasonable step taken to ensure inaccurate data are erased or rectified without delay.

3. The transfer of a minor's personal data without proper verification demonstrates a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default under Article 25, particularly regarding data minimization and accuracy.

4. The controller's claim that the processing was for solvency checks when preparing a contract relies on Article 6(1)(b) as the legal basis (necessary for contract performance). However, the lack of identity verification undermines the lawfulness of this processing, as inaccurate data cannot be necessary for a legitimate purpose under Article 5(1)(b).

5. The processing of a minor's data raises concerns under Article 8, which requires specific protections for children's data, including verifying that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility when applicable. The controller failed to make reasonable efforts to verify this, as required.

6. The controller's failure to ensure data accuracy before transfer also violates Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency), as processing based on inaccurate data is inherently unfair to data subjects.

7. The DPA's finding that the controller did not allow proper exercise of rights during proceedings suggests potential violations of Article 12, which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and provide transparent communications.

8. The imposition of a fine by the DPA indicates that the violations were deemed serious under Article 83(2), considering factors such as the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, and the number of data subjects affected.

9. The controller's arguments regarding the disproportionate fine and procedural issues do not negate the established violations of GDPR principles and provisions, particularly those related to data accuracy, lawfulness, and protection of minors' data.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A healthcare provider (controller) requested a prior consultation from the DPA in line with Article 36 GDPR regarding its new Health Benefit Analysis tool. The system was designed to improve the preventive and proactive approach to healthcare by using algorithms to identify patients with health risks. After this, a healthcare professional would assess the need for treatment.

To assess the legality of the planned processing of personal data, the DPA decided to handle the case not as a prior consultation but as supervision. The DPA considered in particular whether using the Health Benefit Analysis tool for patients would constitute automated individual decision-making under Article 22 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 22, Article 58","1. The case involves a healthcare provider (controller) planning to process personal data using a Health Benefit Analysis tool that employs algorithms to identify patients with health risks, followed by a healthcare professional's assessment of treatment needs. This processing involves special categories of personal data (health data) under Article 9(1) GDPR.

2. The processing of health data is generally prohibited under Article 9(1) unless an exception applies. The healthcare provider may rely on Article 9(2)(h) for processing necessary for preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, or healthcare provision, but must implement suitable safeguards as required by Article 9(3) and adhere to additional conditions for automated processing under Article 22.

3. The Health Benefit Analysis tool uses algorithms to identify patients with health risks, which constitutes profiling and automated processing under Article 4(4) GDPR. When such automated processing results in decisions that significantly affect data subjects (e.g., identifying health risks that may lead to medical interventions), it falls under the scope of Article 22(1) on automated individual decision-making.

4. Article 22(1) prohibits decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produce legal effects or similarly significantly affect the data subject, unless exceptions under Article 22(2) apply. The case describes a process where the algorithm identifies risks, and a healthcare professional subsequently assesses the need for treatment. However, if the algorithm's output substantially influences the professional's decision, it may still be considered ""solely"" automated under GDPR guidelines, as the human intervention must be meaningful and not merely rubber-stamp the automated result.

5. For processing involving special categories of data like health data, Article 22(4) imposes stricter requirements: such decisions cannot be based solely on automated processing unless based on the data subject's explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) or authorized by Union/Member State law for substantial public interest (Article 9(2)(g)), and must include suitable safeguards. The healthcare provider must demonstrate that these conditions are met, including measures to safeguard data subjects' rights under Article 22(3).

6. The DPA, acting under its supervisory powers (Article 58 GDPR), determined that the processing did not comply with Article 22 requirements. The lack of meaningful human intervention or inadequate safeguards likely contributed to this finding, as the algorithm's role in risk identification could significantly affect patients without sufficient human oversight or data subject rights protections.

7. Additionally, the controller failed to adequately address the data protection impact assessment (DPIA) requirements under Article 35, particularly for high-risk processing involving automated decision-making and health data. A DPIA must include an assessment of risks to data subjects and measures to mitigate them, which appears insufficient in this case.

8. Therefore, the processing violates Article 22(1) and Article 9(1) in conjunction with Article 22(4), as it involves automated decision-making based on health data without meeting the exceptions or implementing required safeguards, leading to a significant risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

9. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The DPA received a number of complaints from data subjects about Amplifon, a company selling hearing aids (the controller). The controller allegedly sent them a written letter via post inviting them to a free hearing test, despite the fact that they had not previously consented to receiving such marketing communication. The DPA therefore launched an ex officio investigation on 1 January 2020.

The controller claimed that letter assessing the need for hearing tests were only sent to persons listed in the database provided by the Ministry of Interior. On average, the controller requested data every 2-3 months, with an average of 3-400.000 data subjects' names and addresses per request. All data were transferred to a separate, secure server by the controller's competent employees, and the entire contents of the device were irretrievably deleted after the transfer. The purpose of the data collection – stated by the controller in the request to the Ministry – was to contact and maintain contacts for direct marketing purposes and, in subsequent requests (after 23 February 2021), for market research.

In the controller's view, Article 3(1)(d) of the Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing allowed the collection of data from the sources specified in the legislation. Accordingly, the market researcher may request name and address data from the register of the Ministry of Interior for the purpose of contacting the data subject. Provided that the data subject had not refused the disclosure of his or her data.

The controller stated that it used consent of the data subjects as the legal basis, arguing that the data subjects had the possibility to withdraw their consent at the Ministry of Interior or the controller if they do not wish their personal data to be processed.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 14","1. The case involves processing of personal data by Amplifon (the controller) for direct marketing purposes through postal letters, which falls under the scope of GDPR as it involves processing operations related to offering goods/services to data subjects in the Union (Article 3(1)).

2. The controller claimed consent as the legal basis under Article 6(1)(a), but the data subjects had not given affirmative consent - merely not refusing disclosure at the Ministry of Interior. GDPR requires consent to be a ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication"" through a ""clear affirmative action"" (Article 4(11)), which was not satisfied here.

3. The processing involved health-related data (hearing test invitations), which constitutes special category data under Article 9(1) as it reveals information about health status. For such processing, explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) is required, which was not obtained.

4. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects as required by Article 14 when personal data are not obtained from the data subject, including the source of the data and the right to object to processing.

5. The controller relied on national law (Act CXIX of 1995) allowing processing based on non-refusal, but under Article 23(1), such national restrictions must respect the essence of fundamental rights and be proportionate. The GDPR's consent requirements represent the essence of data protection rights, and the national law cannot override them.

6. The processing for direct marketing purposes triggers the data subject's right to object under Article 21(2), which must be explicitly brought to their attention at the latest at the time of first communication, which was not done.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to lack of valid legal basis, failure to obtain explicit consent for special category data, insufficient transparency, and incompatibility with the fundamental principles of GDPR."
"A data subject lodged a complaint with the Italian DPA because he received an email containing unsolicited marketing communication regarding ticket-sales for a play promoted by Teatro Colosseo (controller). The data subject stated that it never gave consent to the reception of such communications. Furthermore, the data subject complained about the controller’s failure to respond to its request to exercise its rights under Articles 15, 17 and 21 GDPR. Following the complaint, the DPA opened an investigation into the controller.

The controller stated that it never had access to the data subject's data. In fact, the marketing communication was allegedly sent by another company. Namely, one that it hired in the past for the promotion of a different event. This task was allegedly given orally to that company in return for remuneration. Confident in the guarantees offered by that company in the field of the promotion of shows and cultural events, also on behalf of third parties, the controller did not deem it necessary at the time to exercise a power of control or issue instructions.

Furthermore, the controller stated that the marketing company would have acted as an autonomous controller, because it would have independently determined the means of processing and the recipients of the communications. The marketing company used its own list of contacts, that was never in possession of the controller. To substantiate this claim, the controller added that it did not own the email address used to send the promotional message. This belonged to a third party, to which the marketing company further delegated the promotional activity.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17, Article 21, Article 24","1. The case involves a data subject who received unsolicited marketing communications from Teatro Colosseo (controller) without providing consent, and the controller failed to respond to the data subject's requests to exercise rights under Articles 15, 17, and 21 of the GDPR.

2. The controller claimed that the marketing communication was sent by another company hired for promotion, which acted as an autonomous controller using its own contact list, and that the controller never possessed the data subject's data or the email address used.

3. According to Article 4 of the GDPR, a controller is defined as the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. Here, Teatro Colosseo, as the promoter of the event, determined the purpose of processing (marketing for ticket sales) and engaged another company to achieve this purpose, making it a controller responsible for the processing activities.

4. Article 5(2) (accountability principle) requires the controller to be responsible for, and able to demonstrate compliance with, the data protection principles, including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. The controller failed to demonstrate that valid consent was obtained for the marketing communication, violating Article 6(1)(a) (lawfulness of processing based on consent) and Article 7 (conditions for consent).

5. Article 24(1) requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR. The controller's oral agreement with the marketing company and lack of oversight or instructions indicate a failure to implement such measures, violating the accountability principle.

6. Article 28(1) requires that when processing is carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures. The controller did not ensure such guarantees or have a written contract in place, as required by Article 28(3), and failed to monitor the processor's activities, violating these provisions.

7. The controller's failure to respond to the data subject's requests under Articles 15 (right of access), 17 (right to erasure), and 21 (right to object) violates Article 12(1)-(3), which mandates that the controller facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and respond without undue delay, within one month of receipt.

8. Article 29 states that any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor must not process personal data except on instructions from the controller. The marketing company, acting on behalf of the controller, processed data without proper instructions, and the controller failed to ensure compliance, violating this article.

9. The controller's attempt to disclaim responsibility by arguing that the marketing company acted as an autonomous controller is contradicted by the fact that the processing was for the controller's promotional purposes, and the controller engaged the company without adequate safeguards or control, further highlighting noncompliance with Articles 5, 24, and 28.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations, including lack of lawful basis for processing, failure to demonstrate accountability, inadequate processor management, and non-response to data subject rights requests."
"The municipality (the controller) published on its online Public Notice Board, as well in a press release, information about the data subject's dismissal from work. The publication contained a matriculation number, which made the data subject identifiable.

Subsequently, the data subject decided to file a complaint with the Italian DPA. The DPA initiated proceedings and requested more information from the controller.

The controller argued that the information had been put through pseudonymisation first and only employees knew how to decrypt it. Furthermore, the online Notice Board was not indexed in search engines. With regards to the press release, the controller argued that the text was anonymous and did not allow for the identification of the data subject.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the municipality as the controller processing personal data by publishing information about the data subject's dismissal, including a matriculation number that made the data subject identifiable, which falls under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller claimed that pseudonymisation was applied, but according to Article 4(5), pseudonymisation is processing personal data so that it can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately. However, the controller admitted that employees knew how to decrypt the data, meaning the additional information was not sufficiently separated, and the matriculation number itself directly identified the data subject, violating the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

3. The publication of the data subject's dismissal information on an online Public Notice Board and in a press release constitutes processing of personal data. The controller failed to establish a lawful basis for this processing under Article 6(1), as no condition such as consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests was properly applied or demonstrated.

4. The data related to employment dismissal may involve special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (e.g., potentially revealing health data or other sensitive information), and the controller did not meet any of the exceptions in Article 9(2) for processing such data, such as explicit consent or substantial public interest, thus violating the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data.

5. The controller argued that the online Notice Board was not indexed by search engines and that the press release was anonymous, but the use of a matriculation number made the data subject identifiable, contradicting the claim of anonymity. This violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing was not transparent or fair to the data subject.

6. The publication of personal data without adequate safeguards or a lawful basis also violates the data subject's right to privacy and data protection under Article 1 and the principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), as the data was disclosed more widely than necessary and without a clear retention period.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The investigation was started by ANSPDCP as a result of the notification of the controller  for  a data security violation by Compania Națională Poșta Română SA, as a processor.

As part of the investigation, it turned out that the  Compania Națională Poșta Română SA lost certain postal items that contained decisions establishing pension rights, work cards and death certificates, affecting 35 natural persons .

It was also found that the processor  did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of confidentiality and security of the personal data of the data subjects, which led to the loss, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to certain personal data .",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves Compania Națională Poșta Română SA acting as a processor for personal data processing activities, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as established in Article 2 (Material scope).

2. The processor lost postal items containing sensitive personal data including decisions establishing pension rights, work cards, and death certificates, affecting 35 natural persons. This constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) as ""a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data.""

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers and processors to ""implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,"" including measures to protect against ""accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data."" The investigation found the processor failed to implement adequate measures to ensure confidentiality and security of personal data.

4. Article 28(1) requires that controllers use only processors providing ""sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures"" to meet GDPR requirements. The processor's failure to prevent the loss of postal items demonstrates insufficient guarantees and inadequate measures.

5. The lost data included information that likely falls under special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (such as data concerning health from pension decisions and death certificates), which requires higher protection standards that were not met.

6. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify personal data breaches to supervisory authorities without undue delay, but the case shows the controller notified ANSPDCP of the violation, indicating the processor failed to prevent the breach that required notification.

7. The processor's actions violated the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f), which requires that personal data be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.""

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"JP/Politikens Hus A/S (controller) is an operator of the news website, www.eb.dk. In 2021, the Danish DPA conducted an inspection into how the controller processed personal data of visitors on its website. During the check, the website had a cookie consent solution allowing the visitors to click on three different boxes: ""Only necessary"" (in a red box), ""Customise settings"" (in a grey box) and ""Accept all"" (in a green box).

From the ""first layer"" of the consent solution, it appeared that the controller processed personal data for statistical and marketing purposes. In the ""second layer"", which the visitor could access by clicking on ""Customise settings"", the visitor could select the processing for preferences, statistics and marketing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves JP/Politikens Hus A/S as a controller processing personal data of website visitors through a cookie consent solution, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of processing and controller).

2. The controller's consent solution presents three options: ""Only necessary"" (red), ""Customise settings"" (grey), and ""Accept all"" (green). Under Article 4(11), consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The use of color coding (green for acceptance and red for rejection) may create a visual nudge that undermines the freedom of choice, potentially violating the requirement that consent must be freely given under Article 7(4), which states that utmost account should be taken of whether the performance of a contract is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary.

3. The first layer of the consent solution provides limited information about the processing purposes (statistical and marketing). Article 13 requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide comprehensive information, including the purposes of processing, legal basis, and other details. The initial presentation fails to meet these transparency requirements, as it does not provide all necessary information upfront.

4. The second layer (accessible via ""Customise settings"") allows selection of preferences, statistics, and marketing, but the initial layer does not clearly indicate that rejecting all non-necessary processing is as easy as accepting all. Article 7(3) requires that it must be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it, and by extension, the principle of fairness under Article 5 implies that rejecting non-essential processing should not be more difficult than accepting it.

5. The consent mechanism does not ensure that consent is specific to each purpose. Under Article 7, consent must be given for specific purposes, and the bundled options (e.g., ""Accept all"") may not allow for granular consent, potentially violating the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b).

6. The presentation of options (with colors suggesting acceptance or rejection) may not constitute an unambiguous indication of consent as required by Article 4(11). The use of design elements that influence user choice could be seen as not providing a clear affirmative action, which is necessary for valid consent.

7. The controller must be able to demonstrate that consent was obtained in compliance with the GDPR, as per Article 7(1). The described consent solution, with its layered approach and potential for nudging, may not meet this accountability requirement.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of principles related to lawful processing (Article 6), conditions for consent (Articles 4(11) and 7), transparency (Article 13), and fairness (Article 5(1)(a))."
"A construction company (controller) suffered a data breach, which was triggered by the controller's employee opening a phishing email, which contained malware. The controller's virus scanner removed some of the malware, but the hacker still had access to the employee's computer and infected some additional servers and systems. The attacker used the access to uninstall the controller's anti-virus solution which resulted in the personal data of up to 113,000 employees being compromised. The attacker encrypted the data and made it unavailable for the controller. The compromised data included several categories of personal data as well as sensitive data and special categories of data. At the time of the attack, one of the two employees who received the phishing email had not undertaken data protection training. On 5 May 2020, the controller submitted a personal data breach notification to the UK DPA (DPA). The DPA subsequently commenced an investigation into the breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a construction company acting as a data controller that suffered a personal data breach affecting 113,000 employees, including sensitive data and special categories of personal data (Article 4 definitions of 'controller', 'personal data', and 'special categories of data').

2. The breach occurred due to an employee opening a phishing email, which allowed malware to infect systems and resulted in unauthorized access to and encryption of personal data (Article 4 definition of 'personal data breach').

3. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to protect against unauthorized access to personal data. The failure to prevent the phishing attack and subsequent system compromise indicates inadequate security measures.

4. Article 32 specifically requires taking into account the state of the art and the nature of the processing, and implementing measures such as staff training. The fact that one of the employees who received the phishing email had not undertaken data protection training demonstrates a failure in implementing appropriate organizational measures as required by Article 32.

5. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The encryption of data by the attacker constitutes a clear violation of this integrity and confidentiality principle.

6. For special categories of data under Article 9, higher safeguards are required. The compromise of sensitive data indicates a failure to implement these enhanced protections as mandated by Article 9.

7. While the controller notified the breach to the DPA (as required by Article 33), the investigation revealed underlying security deficiencies that violated the core security obligations under Articles 5 and 32.

8. The controller's failure to maintain adequate anti-virus protection and staff training programs constitutes a violation of the accountability principle under Article 5(2), which requires controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"DISCORD is a voice over IP (technology that allows users to chat via their microphone and/or webcam over the Internet) and instant messaging service, in which users can create servers, text, voice and video rooms. The service is published by DISCORD INC, a company based in the United States.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 25, Article 32, Article 35","1. The case involves DISCORD INC, a company based in the United States, providing services to users which include processing of personal data through voice over IP and instant messaging functionalities (Article 4 definitions of 'processing' and 'personal data').

2. Under Article 3 (Territorial scope), this Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services to such data subjects in the Union. DISCORD INC, as a US-based company offering services to EU users, falls under this scope.

3. Article 27 requires that where Article 3(2) applies (controllers or processors not established in the Union), the controller or processor shall designate in writing a representative in the Union. DISCORD INC, being subject to GDPR under Article 3, has not been indicated to have designated an EU representative, which is a violation.

4. Article 44 (General principle for transfers) states that any transfer of personal data to a third country shall take place only if conditions laid down in Chapter V are complied with. The United States is considered a third country under GDPR.

5. Article 45 requires that transfers to third countries may take place only if the Commission has decided that the third country ensures an adequate level of protection. The US does not have an adequacy decision from the European Commission.

6. Article 46 requires that in the absence of an adequacy decision, appropriate safeguards must be provided for transfers, such as binding corporate rules or standard data protection clauses. The case does not indicate that DISCORD INC has implemented such safeguards for data transfers to the US.

7. Articles 13 and 14 require that data subjects be provided with specific information about processing, including transfers to third countries and the safeguards used. The case does not demonstrate that DISCORD INC provides this information to EU users in accordance with these articles.

8. Therefore, based on the violations of Article 27 (lack of EU representative), Article 44-46 (inadequate safeguards for data transfers to a third country), and Articles 13-14 (lack of proper information to data subjects), the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The Belgian DPA's Inspection Service started an investigation of the regional government agency for tourism. The controller collects personal data of Airbnb hosts through Airbnb as intermediary. The controller is legally tasked to watch over the quality of the Airbnb hosts. This legal task forms the legal basis for the controller. The Inspection Service held that the controller couldn't rely on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, the controller interprets its legal obligations too broadly.

On top of that, the Inspection Service held that the controller breaches Article 12(1) GDPR, Article 13 GDPR and Article 14 GDPR because the information in their privacy policy was not concise, transparent, nor easily accessible, as well as containing wrong and missing information. The controller admits that this used to be the case, but that this issue has now been resolved.

Following, the Inspection Service held that the website placed non-strictly necessary cookies without providing a way to refuse the cookies, nor were the website visitors provided with clear information. The controller contests this and also states that a new website was launched in the meantime, which follows best practices.

Lastly, the Inspection Service held that the DPO was not proactively involved nor consulted, resulting in a breach of Article 38(1) GDPR and Article 39(1) GDPR. For the processing as described above, the controller stated that the DPO did not need to be consulted as the Logiesdecreet provided the legal basis to process data. However, the DPO did provide a positive advice afters the first contact of the Inspection Service.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 24, Article 25, Article 38, Article 39","1. The controller, a regional government agency for tourism, processes personal data of Airbnb hosts under the claim of a legal task (Logiesdecreet) as the legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. However, the Inspection Service found that the controller interpreted its legal obligations too broadly, meaning the processing was not strictly necessary for compliance with a specific legal obligation, thus violating Article 6(1)(c) which requires that processing be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.

2. The Inspection Service determined that the controller breached Article 12(1) GDPR, as the information provided in the privacy policy was not concise, transparent, intelligible, or easily accessible, failing to meet the requirement that information be provided in a clear and plain language manner. Additionally, the controller violated Article 13 and Article 14 GDPR by providing wrong and missing information, such as failing to adequately inform data subjects about the purposes, legal basis, and other necessary details required at the time of data collection or when data is obtained from other sources.

3. The controller placed non-strictly necessary cookies without providing a mechanism for refusal or clear information, which violates the principles of transparency and lawful processing under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the requirements for consent under Article 4(11) and Article 7 GDPR, as valid consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, and there must be a way to withdraw consent easily.

4. The controller failed to proactively involve and consult the Data Protection Officer (DPO) as required under Article 38(1) GDPR, which mandates that the controller ensure the DPO is involved properly and in a timely manner in all issues relating to data protection. The controller's argument that consultation was unnecessary due to the legal basis was incorrect, as the DPO must be involved in all processing activities regardless of the legal basis. This also constitutes a breach of Article 39(1) GDPR, which outlines the tasks of the DPO, including monitoring compliance and providing advice.

5. Given the violations of Article 6(1)(c), Article 12(1), Article 13, Article 14, Article 5(1)(a), Article 7, Article 38(1), and Article 39(1) GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In February 2022, a security breach occured at the Municipality of Dobrzyniewo Duże (the controller). There was a break-in at an employee's flat and a laptop was stolen containing files with personal data of individuals (data subjects). As a consequence, the confidentiality of the personal data was compromised. The controller determined the scale of the resulting breach, which showed that the stolen computer contained 51 records with personal data in the following areas: name, address of residence or stay and PESEL (personal identification number). The Polish DPA initiated an ex officio investigation into the security breach as well as the controller's data processing practices.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves the Municipality of Dobrzyniewo Duże as the controller, which is subject to the GDPR regulations as a public authority processing personal data (Article 4, definition of 'controller').

2. The controller experienced a security breach where a stolen laptop contained unencrypted personal data including names, addresses, and PESEL numbers (national identification numbers), compromising data confidentiality (Article 32(1)-(a), which requires encryption of personal data).

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical measures (encryption) to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), given the sensitive nature of PESEL numbers which are identifiers of general application under Article 87.

4. The processing of national identification numbers (PESEL) requires appropriate safeguards under Article 87, which were not implemented through encryption or other technical measures.

5. The breach involved personal data that could identify natural persons, falling under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1), and the controller failed to ensure appropriate security against unauthorized access under the integrity and confidentiality principle of Article 5(1)-(f).

6. The controller had obligations under Article 24(1) to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR, which were not fulfilled given the lack of encryption on the stolen device.

7. While not explicitly stated in the case facts, the investigation likely revealed insufficient organisational measures regarding device security and data handling procedures, violating the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

8. The breach notification requirements under Articles 33 and 34 may also have been implicated, though the case focuses primarily on the security deficiencies that enabled the breach.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of GDPR security and processing principles."
"A data breach was reported to the DPA by ING Bank NV Amsterdam Sucursala București (the controller). The controller claimed that unauthorized access to and disclosure of some of its customers' (the data subjects') personal information had occurred. Data from the identity card, contact information, financial information (transactions and products held, card data), and usernames and passwords for the Internet Banking module (Home'Bank) were all included in the data. As a result, third parties transferred money from the data subject's bank accounts. Following the notification, the DPA started an investigation into the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves ING Bank NV Amsterdam Sucursala București as the controller processing personal data of customers, including identity card information, contact details, financial data, and usernames/passwords, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of personal data and processing).

2. The controller reported a data breach to the DPA, which is required under Article 33(1) for notification of a personal data breach without undue delay. However, the breach itself indicates a failure in implementing appropriate security measures as mandated by Article 32(1), which requires technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access or disclosure.

3. The personal data breached included sensitive information such as financial data and passwords, which should have been protected with heightened security measures under Article 32(1)(a) (encryption and pseudonymization) and Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle). The unauthorized access and subsequent financial theft suggest that these measures were not adequately implemented or effective.

4. Article 5(2) (accountability principle) requires the controller to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles. The occurrence of the breach and the resulting harm (money transfers by third parties) indicate that the controller failed to demonstrate such compliance, particularly in safeguarding data against risks.

5. Under Article 34(1), if a data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subjects without undue delay. The financial losses incurred by data subjects constitute a high risk, and if the controller did not communicate the breach promptly or effectively, it would violate this article.

6. The DPA's investigation and verdict of NONCOMPLIANT imply that the controller did not meet the obligations under Articles 32, 33, or 34, or other relevant provisions, as the breach led to actual harm and was preventable with proper security measures.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to failures in implementing appropriate security measures, potentially inadequate notification or communication, and lack of demonstration of compliance under the accountability principle."
"The controller is a limited liability company in Hungary and also part of the Samlerhuset Group, an international group of companies based in Amsterdam. It sold different versions of commemorative and historical coins, with a specific focus on Hungarian history. The controller acquired the data of its customers as follows: they can place an order by filling in a form, received as part of advertising materials via postal mail. This data includes name, address, phone number, e-mail address.

Since July 2020, the DPA received several complaints from data subjects concerning the processing of their data by the controller and objecting to its data processing practices. In most cases, the controller created a user account (profile) with the personal data provided during the purchase or ordering process. However, it only informed the data subjects afterwards about the processing. The DPA therefore carried out a test registration on the controller's website and analysed the privacy notices on the website and from the postal mail. Based on its findings, the DPA suspected an infringement of GDPR and launched an investigation.

During the DPA’s investigation, the controller provided the following information on its data processing: potential new customers received a promotional mailing by post. In the controller's view, this did not constitute direct marketing under the Hungarian Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing. The controller argued that the promotional material was sent to the data subjects together with a newspaper, to which they were subscribed pursuant to a contract with another separate company. Thus, the controller did not contact data subjects directly by itself. The data subjects could then contact the controller online, by phone or by post, in case they would like to order coins.

In the online shopping process, the information on data processing is linked at the end of the order. The controller emphasized that the online registration did not involve the processing of any more personal data than a purchase without registration. It was also possible to order products by phone or by post, without registering an online account. The data subjects gave their consent by signing the order form in writing for postal orders, verbally for phone orders and by ticking a specific checkbox for online orders.

The controller also informed the DPA that for the purpose of targeted advertising on Facebook and Google social media platforms, the controller manually selected – without automated decision-making – a group of its customers with an e-mail address for whom the given advertisement may be relevant. This list of addresses was hashed and uploaded to the Facebook and Google advertising systems for the display of the advertisement to data subjects whose email address hash matched an element of the uploaded hash list.

The controller further stressed that it found data protection highly important, and it employed a dedicated data protection officer (DPO) as well.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13","1. The controller processes personal data, including name, address, phone number, and email address, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR, as it relates to identifiable natural persons.

2. The controller collects personal data directly from data subjects through order forms via postal mail, phone, or online methods, which triggers the obligation under Article 13 to provide specific information at the time of data collection, such as the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, and recipients of data.

3. However, the controller only informs data subjects about the processing after creating user accounts, which violates Article 13(1) and (2), as the information must be provided at the time when personal data are obtained, not retrospectively.

4. For targeted advertising on Facebook and Google, the controller processes hashed email addresses and shares them with these platforms, but fails to inform data subjects about these recipients at the time of data collection, as required by Article 13(1)(e), which mandates disclosure of recipients or categories of recipients.

5. The controller's reliance on consent for processing (via written, verbal, or checkbox means) is undermined by the lack of prior information, as Article 7 requires that consent be informed and specific; without timely information, consent cannot be validly obtained.

6. The controller's argument that promotional mailings are not direct marketing under Hungarian law is irrelevant to GDPR compliance, as GDPR Article 3 establishes its territorial scope and minimum standards, and processing must adhere to GDPR principles regardless of national laws, unless explicitly derogated under Article 23.

7. The practice of creating user accounts without prior information also violates the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a), which requires that processing be lawful, fair, and transparent in relation to the data subject.

8. Therefore, due to violations of Articles 13, 7, and 5(1)(a), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Portuguese DPA started an investigation into the Municipality of Setubal (controller) after a journalistic article from the newspaper Expresso was published titled Ukrainians welcomed in CDU Chamber by Pro-Putin Russians' (""Ucranianos recebidos em Câmara CDU por russos Pró-Putin"").

This article contained anonymous accounts of Ukrainian refugees. According to the Article, Russian citizens were present in the same room where Ukrainian refugees' personal data was stored (such as copies of identification documents). These Russian citizens - allegedly part of an Eastern European Immigrants' Association (EDINSTVO), an organisation for the support of eastern European migrants - also asked the refugees questions about the whereabouts of their relatives and what they were doing in Ukraine. In total, two members of the EDINSTVO were integrated by the controller into the Setúbal Office of Ethnicities and Immigration (SEI) in order to provide assistance, counselling and help to the refugees. According to the author of the article, these Russian citizens were accused in the article of sharing this personal data with the Russian Government.

This all happened in the framework of a Municipal Refugee Helpline (LIMAR), which was created in March 2022. The controller was responsible for the processing done by this helpline. The Helpline used two rooms of the controller's building in order to offer their services, one for the customer service and the other for archiving. Both rooms were only accessible for members of the helpline.

The helpline used two forms in order to collect the data from refugees seeking attendance: an assistance form and telephone assistance form. Using these forms, personal data was collected by the controller. Among other things, the controller collected the name, address, date of birth, marital status, information on the support network (identifying the places and people they might stay with and their respective households) and information on the period they might stay with the people in that support network, in addition to describing the specific situation of each refugee. The assistance forms were handwritten and were stored in a filing cabinet. All collected personal data was later also put into an Excel file which was protected by password.

Additionally, forms were accompanied by a declaration of consent for processing. The controller asked refugees for consent to authorise that the data records collected may be shared with other services or entities for the purpose of to specific responses or to provide social support adjusted to the situation adjusted to the situation, with the guarantees of privacy and non-discrimination'. Furthermore, together with the assistance forms, refugees were also offered to sign up for Portuguese language courses, for which they needed to provide a copy of an identification document.

In this context, one of the Russian citizens, who acted as a translator, was on medical leave for some time. This translator was informally substituted by her husband. The translator had given her husband her login-credentials to access the helpline's systems. This change was not documented or formalised in any way. The husband, who was not a controller's employee, helped to collect and copy personal data and documents from various refugees and acted as a translator himself.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 37","1. The case involves the Municipality of Setubal as a data controller processing personal data of Ukrainian refugees, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out by a public authority and involves structured personal data.

2. The controller processed special categories of personal data (including data revealing ethnic origin and potentially health information) under Article 9(1) without establishing a proper lawful basis under Article 9(2). While consent was obtained, the consent form was vague (""shared with other services or entities for specific responses"") and did not meet the standard of explicit consent required for special category data under Article 9(2)(a).

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25. Physical copies of identification documents and assistance forms were stored in filing cabinets without adequate access controls, allowing unauthorized persons (the Russian citizens) potential access to sensitive data.

4. The controller violated Article 32 on security of processing by: (a) allowing non-employees (the EDINSTVO members) to process personal data without sufficient guarantees; (b) permitting password sharing between the translator and her husband; and (c) failing to implement proper access controls to processing areas and systems.

5. The controller breached Article 29 by allowing processing under the authority of the controller without proper instructions, as the translator's husband (a non-employee) processed personal data using shared credentials without formal authorization or oversight.

6. The principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) was violated by collecting excessive personal data (including detailed information about support networks and household details) not strictly necessary for the stated purposes of providing assistance.

7. The controller failed to conduct a proper data protection impact assessment under Article 35 for processing operations that involved systematic processing of special categories of data on a large scale, which likely presented high risks to refugees' rights and freedoms.

8. The transfer of personal data to third parties (the EDINSTVO association members) without adequate safeguards or proper legal basis under Chapter V of the GDPR constitutes a violation, particularly given the alleged connections to the Russian government which could compromise data protection.

9. The controller did not maintain proper records of processing activities as required by Article 30, particularly regarding the involvement of third parties and the unauthorized processing by the translator's husband.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"A political party used Google docs to store data of sympathisers and addressees of mailings in Excel files. The files were leaked and made publicly available, the link of the files also being published in an article on a political portal. Given that a large number of data subjects and special categories of data were concerned, the DPA (NAIH) conducted an inspection and found that the security of the processing was not sufficiently ensured by the controller. The controller also did not respond to the demand of the authority to indicate the measures taken to secure the data and to notify the data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 32, Article 83","1. The case involves a political party as a data controller processing personal data of sympathizers and addressees, including special categories of data (political opinions), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2.

2. The controller used Google Docs to store Excel files containing personal data, which were leaked and made publicly accessible, indicating a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing. The leakage of files demonstrates insufficient security measures, violating Article 32.

4. Article 33 mandates that controllers notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach within 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. The controller failed to respond to the DPA's demand regarding breach notification, indicating non-compliance with Article 33.

5. Article 34 requires controllers to communicate the breach to data subjects without undue delay when it is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The controller's failure to notify data subjects, as evidenced by their non-response to the DPA, violates Article 34.

6. The processing involved special categories of data (political opinions) under Article 9, which requires stricter conditions for lawful processing. The breach indicates a failure to implement appropriate safeguards for such sensitive data, violating Article 9.

7. Article 31 obligates controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request. The controller's failure to respond to the DPA's demand for information on security measures and breach notification constitutes a violation of Article 31.

8. The controller's actions also violate the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations, including inadequate security measures, failure to notify the breach to the supervisory authority and data subjects, and lack of cooperation with the DPA."
"The data subject, a member of the Association of Owners of Bld. Pipera 1-2E, filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA alleging that the President of the Association of Owners (the controller) had made block recordings from the association-managed video surveillance system, which contained pictures of the data subject, available on the WhatsApp group. Following the complaint, the DPA started an investigation into the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of personal data through a video surveillance system managed by the Association of Owners, where the President (the controller) made recordings containing images of the data subject available on a WhatsApp group, as per the case description.

2. The images from the video surveillance system constitute personal data under Article 4(1), as they relate to an identifiable natural person (the data subject).

3. The controller must comply with the principles of processing under Article 5, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, and data minimization. The purpose of video surveillance is typically for security, but sharing recordings on WhatsApp likely exceeds this specific purpose, violating the purpose limitation principle (Article 5(1)(b)).

4. The processing (sharing the recordings) requires a lawful basis under Article 6. The case does not indicate consent from the data subject or any other lawful basis such as necessity for a contract or legitimate interests that would justify this sharing, potentially violating Article 6(1).

5. The controller has obligations to provide information to the data subject under Articles 13 and 14, including the purposes of processing and recipients of the data. The unauthorized sharing on WhatsApp suggests a failure to inform data subjects about this specific processing, violating transparency requirements.

6. The sharing of personal data (images) via WhatsApp, a platform that may involve transfers to third countries or insufficient safeguards, could violate Chapter V (Articles 44-49) if adequate protections are not in place, though the case does not specify this detail.

7. The controller must ensure appropriate security measures under Article 32 to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Making recordings available on a WhatsApp group without proper access controls likely constitutes a breach of security, leading to unauthorized disclosure.

8. The DPA's investigation indicates potential infringements, and under Article 83, such violations could lead to administrative fines, particularly under Article 83(4) and (5), depending on the nature of the infringement.

9. Based on the above, the controller's actions violate multiple provisions of the GDPR, including principles of lawfulness, purpose limitation, transparency, and security, making the processing noncompliant.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In May 2022, the Norwegian DPA was approached by a grocery chain and a payment transaction provider regarding an instruction the former had received from the national statistical institute Statistics Norway (SSB), to submit purchase data (""bongdata"" in Norwegian) to them. The DPA had also received several complaints and inquiries from private parties regarding this matter, and in June they asked SSB, by letter, to clarify. Following their reply, the DPA and SSB had a meeting in August.

The various interactions clarified that SSB had instructed the main grocery chains in Norway (Rema 1000, NorgesGruppen, Coop and Bunnpris, accounting for about 99% of the Norwegian grocery market) to start submitting purchase data (""bongdata"" in Norwegian) to them on a regular basis, including:

* name of item
* price per item* total amount of the receipt
* payment method
* amount per payment method
* start and end time of the purchase
* ID of returns
* ID for terminated purchase
* ID of offers/discounts

The data would be reported directly from the point of sale systems so that SSB would receive the data continuously. Purchased items would be classified into product groups and consumers would be classified by size and type of household, income, level of education and country region. This would be contingent on a connection to transactional data/bank account number and then birth date.

The purchase data do not in themselves contain any personal data. The intention is, however, to connect these with transactional data which then makes it possible to relate the data to an individual person. SSB will link these to transaction data quickly after continuously receiving them, and thus the DPA finds that it is correct to view the purchase data as personal data from the point of collection, and references Recital 26 GDPR. Because of this, the DPA assessed the interference the collection of purchase data represents.

SSB's claimed legal basis for the processing was the Norwegian Statistics Act § 10 Duty to provide information, which states that ""any person must provide the data that are necessary to develop, produce or disseminate official statistics if so ordered by Statistics Norway"". The purpose of the intended processing was to develop, produce and disseminate official statistics as per the Statistics Act, and SSB considered the processing to be necessary. During the investigation, SSB shared two data protection impact assessments (DPIA) with the DPA, one dated 27 January 2021 and the other from the period October 2021 to June 2022.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 58","1. The case involves the processing of purchase data by Statistics Norway (SSB), which becomes personal data when linked with transactional data, as it allows identification of individuals, falling under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. SSB's legal basis for processing is the Norwegian Statistics Act § 10, which requires providing data for official statistics. However, under GDPR Article 6(1), processing must have a lawful basis, and while performing a task in the public interest (Article 6(1)(e)) could apply, the processing must comply with all GDPR principles, including necessity and proportionality.

3. The Norwegian DPA found that the processing was not necessary or proportionate, violating the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as SSB did not demonstrate that the extensive collection of detailed purchase data was limited to what is necessary for the statistical purposes.

4. The processing involves linking purchase data with transactional data and classifying consumers by household size, income, education, etc., which may involve special categories of data under Article 9(1) (e.g., data concerning health if product groups reveal health information). SSB did not identify a valid exception under Article 9(2) for processing such data, further complicating compliance.

5. SSB conducted DPIAs but failed to adequately address the risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms, as required by Article 35(1) and (7). The DPA found the assessments insufficient, particularly regarding the necessity and proportionality of the processing.

6. The processing did not meet the conditions for consent under Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7, as data subjects were not informed or given a choice, and the obligation to provide data was mandatory under national law, not based on voluntary consent.

7. The purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b) was violated because the broad collection of purchase data for general statistical purposes without specific and defined objectives exceeded what is compatible with the initial purpose of developing official statistics.

8. The DPA determined that SSB did not fulfill the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they could not demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, particularly in justifying the necessity and proportionality of the processing.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of multiple articles, including data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), lawful basis for processing (Article 6), and requirements for processing special categories of data (Article 9), along with inadequate DPIA (Article 35)."
"The French DPA (CNIL) started an investigation into Discord, a company based in the United States (controller). This controller provided a free of charge online service that allowed data subjects to communicate online using text, voice - and video.

The investigation service of the DPA  determined several shortcomings.

During the investigation, the controller stated that it did not have a written data retention policy. The investigation service confirmed that there were 2,474,000 French data subject accounts in the controller’s database that had not been used for more than three years and 58,000 accounts that had not been used for more than five years. During the procedure, the controller added a data retention policy, which described that the controller would delete user accounts after two years of inactivity.

The investigation service found that the information the controller provided regarding data retention periods was incomplete. There were no specific periods or criteria for determining these retention periods. The controller changed this element of the privacy policy during the procedure.

The investigation service also addressed a specific problem about the application for Microsoft Windows: when a data subject, logged in to a voice room, closed the controller’s application window by clicking on the ""X"" icon at the top right of the application, the application would continue to run in the background and the data subject would remain logged in. However, in the majority of Microsoft Windows applications, clicking on the ""X"" will close the application. This 'background minimization' was activated after the first install of the controller's software. The data subject was not informed about this background minimization.  During the procedure, the controller implemented a pop-up window to alert data subjects that the application was still running, when the application window was closed for the first time. The controller also informed data subjects that this setting (remain logged in after closure of application) could be changed in the settings.

At the time of the online investigation, when creating an account, the controller accepted a password of six characters including letters and numbers. The controller also adjusted this during the proceedings: it now required data subjects to use a password of at least eight characters, with at least three of the four different character types. Also, after ten unsuccessful login attempts, the controller now required a captcha prompt to be solved, which was previously not the case.

The investigation service also determined that the controller had previously deemed it unnecessary to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA).  During the procedure, the controller carried out two impact assessments, in which the controller concluded that its processing was not likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 21, Article 25, Article 32, Article 35, Article 55, Article 56","1. The case involves Discord, a controller based in the United States, processing personal data of French data subjects through its online communication service, which falls under the territorial scope of the GDPR as per Article 3(2) due to the offering of services to data subjects in the Union.

2. The controller lacked a written data retention policy, resulting in the storage of 2,474,000 French data subject accounts inactive for over three years and 58,000 accounts inactive for over five years. This violates Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation principle), which requires that personal data be kept in a form permitting identification for no longer than necessary for the purposes processed.

3. The information provided regarding data retention periods was incomplete, with no specific periods or criteria for determining these periods. This violates Article 13(2)(a) and Article 14(2)(a), which require controllers to provide data subjects with information on the period for which personal data will be stored or the criteria used to determine that period, ensuring fair and transparent processing.

4. The controller's application for Microsoft Windows implemented ""background minimization"" where closing the application window kept the application running and the data subject logged in without prior information. This lack of transparency violates Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c), which require controllers to provide clear and plain language information about processing operations, including how data is handled in specific functionalities.

5. The controller initially accepted weak passwords (six characters with letters and numbers) and did not implement captcha after ten unsuccessful login attempts. This violates Article 32(1), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access.

6. The controller deemed a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) unnecessary initially. Given the large-scale processing and monitoring involved in online communication services, this likely violates Article 35(1) and (3), which require a DPIA where processing is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms, particularly when involving systematic monitoring on a large scale.

7. Although the controller implemented corrective measures during the procedure (e.g., adding a retention policy, enhancing password requirements, adding a DPIA), these actions do not rectify the prior violations of Articles 5, 12, 13, 14, 32, and 35, as compliance must be demonstrated at the time of processing under Article 5(2) (accountability principle).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations of its principles and specific obligations."
"The data subject submitted a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR with Douglas Italia S.p.a (the controller). However, she did not receive a response. Therefore, she submitted a complaint with the Italian DPA, asking it to assess what happened. The DPA contacted the controller, requesting further information on the matter. The controller replied that the legal basis for processing was the data subject's membership in its loyalty programme. The controller held that the data subject gave free and specific consent for the processing, and that any refusal to processing would not have prevented her from obtaining the loyalty card. The controller also stated that it had not received the data subject's request, but confirmed that her revocation of consent and cancellation was now handled. The DPA was not satisfied with this response, and initiated an inspection at the controller's headquarters.

Prior to the inspection, the controller highlighted that it was formed in 2019 as a result of the merging of three companies (Limoni Spa, La Gardenia Beauty Spa and Profumerie Douglas Spa) and that it was subject to the management and supervision of its German parent company, Douglas GMBH.

Management of requests to exercise data subject rights

During the on-site inspection, the controller showed the DPA how they normally manage data subject's requests. The DPA concluded that the failure to respond to the data subject's request was a one-time occurrence, compared to the management of other requests, which, as a rule, were handled correctly and timely (within 2-3 days). The DPA therefore decided not pursue an investigation into the possible violation of Article 12(3) GDPR.

Data collection through the Douglas app

The DPA also tested the data collection through the controller's app. The DPA tested the app, and found that the during registration, the user was invited to accept the general terms and conditions, privacy policy, cookie policy and more with a single button ('Ok, I understand, I agree'). Later, when creating the account, the app asked for an e-mail address and date of birth.

The processing of customer data acquired through the merger

During the inspection, the DPA also asked the controller to provide some examples of separate marketing disclosures and consents, for the three companies, before the merger. However, the controller was not able to provide any proof or information regarding the latter. It justified this by stating that it was no longer possible due to the creation of a single database after the merger.

Retention of data relating to customer who have not renewed their loyalty card

The DPA also found that the data of 3,288,170 customers of the three pre-existing companies, who did not activate or renew the loyalty card, were stored on the servers of the German parent company.

The information given to customers

Additionally, the DPA discovered that the information provided to customers on purposes of processing and the legal basis was incomplete and inadequate. The privacy policy informed interested parties that their data would be processed for a variety of purposes on the basis of consent. However, no information was provided on how data collected separately by the three companies was processed after the merger.

Telemarketing carried out by the stores

Regarding the controller's telemarketing activities, the DPA found that customers who consented only to receive promotional SMS notifications, could in reality also receive promotional phone calls, and vice versa. Moreover, the controller admitted to having no scripts prepared for how to conduct the promotional phone calls with respect to protecting the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

Data processing via blogs

Last, the DPA found that there was no information about data processing when interacting with the controller's blog in its privacy policy. The DPA asked the controller to provide the quantitative data of data subjects who had interacted with the blog, as well as the most recent data relating to the registered comments and information on their registration, storage, and the methods and purposes for which they are used. The controller was not able to provide this information.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25","1. The case involves Douglas Italia S.p.a as a data controller processing personal data of a data subject who exercised her rights under Articles 15-22 GDPR but did not receive a response initially, indicating a potential violation of Article 12(3) GDPR, which requires controllers to respond to data subject requests without undue delay and within one month. Although the DPA found this to be a one-time occurrence and did not pursue it further, other violations were identified during the inspection.

2. The controller's app used a single button (""Ok, I understand, I agree"") to obtain consent for multiple processing purposes (general terms, privacy policy, cookie policy, etc.), which violates Article 7 GDPR. This article requires that consent be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, and that requests for consent be presented clearly and separately from other matters. Bundling consents undermines the specificity and freedom of consent.

3. The controller failed to provide proof of lawful processing for customer data acquired through the merger of three companies, violating Article 6 GDPR. The controller could not demonstrate that the processing of pre-merger customer data had a lawful basis post-merger, as required by the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6.

4. The controller retained data of 3,288,170 customers who had not activated or renewed their loyalty cards, stored on servers of the German parent company, without a clear lawful basis or necessity, violating the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. Personal data should not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which they are processed.

5. The privacy policy provided to customers was incomplete and inadequate, as it did not inform data subjects about how data collected separately by the three pre-merger companies was processed after the merger. This violates Article 13 GDPR, which requires controllers to provide specific information to data subjects when collecting personal data directly from them, including the purposes and legal bases for processing.

6. The controller's telemarketing activities allowed promotional phone calls to customers who had only consented to SMS notifications, and vice versa, without separate consents, violating Article 7 GDPR. This practice does not ensure that consent is specific to each purpose, as required. Additionally, the lack of scripts for promotional calls violates Article 25 GDPR (data protection by design and by default), as appropriate measures were not implemented to safeguard data subjects' rights.

7. The controller failed to provide information about data processing related to its blog interactions in the privacy policy and could not supply quantitative data or details on comment registration, storage, and usage purposes. This violates Article 13 GDPR, which mandates transparency about processing activities, and Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency).

8. Overall, the controller's practices demonstrate systemic failures in ensuring lawful processing, obtaining valid consent, providing transparent information, and implementing data protection by design, contravening multiple provisions of the GDPR, including Articles 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 25.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Two data subjects received unsolicited commercial emails from a hotel booking website (the controller). They objected to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes and requested their email address to be deleted form the controller's register. However, the controller did not comply with the request and continued sending unsolicited emails. The same happened to the second data subject. Additionally, one of the data subjects submitted an access request to the controller but did not receive a response.

Both data subjects filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA. The DPA initiated an investigation, trying to contact the controller several times. After not receiving any reply, the DPA started sanctioning proceedings.

During the proceedings, the controller argued that it was not aware of the data protection aspect of its activity and only considered it ""simple advertising"". Moreover, the controller stated that it had given instructions to delete the data from the mailing list, but an error occurred, as a result of which the personal data was still in the register. Furthermore, according to the controller, once the error was remedied, the data subjects were orally informed by a phonecall about the deletion of their data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17","1. The case involves a controller (hotel booking website) processing personal data (email addresses) of data subjects for direct marketing purposes without valid consent, which violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 6(1) as the processing lacks a lawful basis.

2. The data subjects exercised their right to object to processing for direct marketing under Article 21(2), which requires the controller to cease processing immediately. The controller's failure to stop sending emails constitutes a violation of Article 21(3).

3. The data subjects also exercised their right to erasure (""right to be forgotten"") under Article 17(1)(b) by requesting deletion of their email addresses. The controller's failure to promptly erase the data violates this provision.

4. The controller's claim of an ""error"" preventing deletion does not excuse non-compliance, as Article 5(2) requires controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, including implementing appropriate technical measures to fulfill data subject requests.

5. One data subject submitted an access request under Article 15, which the controller failed to respond to within the required one-month period under Article 12(3), constituting a further violation.

6. The controller's attempt to provide oral notification of deletion does not satisfy Article 12(1), which requires communications to be in writing or by other means (including electronic) that ensure proper documentation and transparency.

7. The controller's lack of cooperation with the Hungarian DPA during the investigation violates Article 31, which mandates cooperation with supervisory authorities.

8. The controller's argument that it was unaware of data protection obligations does not excuse non-compliance, as Article 5(2) establishes the principle of accountability requiring controllers to understand and implement GDPR requirements.

9. The cumulative violations of Articles 5, 6, 12, 15, 17, and 21 demonstrate systematic non-compliance with multiple GDPR provisions.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Since 2020, the US company Alpha Exploration Co. Inc. (the controller), has offered and operated the social network Clubhouse. The social network is based exclusively on voice interactions that take place in conversation rooms. Users can choose to open a thematic room or enter another person's room as a listener. From January 2022, using the platform's new features Clips & Replays, users can (i) store and record also part of the conversations on the platform and (ii) share the same recordings with third parties. On the basis of profiling activities, Clubhouse allows other users to find people who may have a common interest or connection. In addition, Clubhouse collects contact data from the address book of its users' devices. This collection would allow users to connect with people they know, and to invite friends to join them on Clubhouse.

Following press reports that revealed the existence of several problems with the way personal data were processed by the controller, the Italian DPA opened an ex officio investigation. The DPA also received a report highlighting a number of critical issues of Clubhouse relating to security, the exercise of data subjects’ rights, the lack of an EU representative, profiling activities, and the retention of personal data. On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA informed the controller a number of violations that the DPA had found following a first assessment on the matter.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 27, Article 32, Article 35, Article 58","1. The case involves Alpha Exploration Co. Inc., a US-based controller operating the Clubhouse social network, which processes personal data of users in the EU through voice interactions, recordings, profiling, and contact data collection from devices' address books.

2. The controller processes personal data (including voice recordings and contact details) without establishing a proper lawful basis under Article 6, as required by the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in Article 5(1)(a). The collection of contact data from users' address books likely occurs without valid consent or another permissible basis.

3. The processing of voice biometric data, which qualifies as special category data under Article 9(1), occurs without obtaining explicit consent or meeting any of the exceptions in Article 9(2), particularly since the recording and sharing features (Clips & Replays) involve processing that uniquely identifies natural persons.

4. The profiling activities described, which allow connecting users based on common interests, violate Article 22(1) as they constitute automated decision-making without providing suitable safeguards, human intervention, or the right to contest decisions, as required by Article 22(2) and (3).

5. The controller fails to designate a representative in the EU as mandated by Article 27, since it is a US company offering services to data subjects in the Union and processing their personal data on a large scale, which is not occasional and poses risks to rights and freedoms.

6. The controller violates Article 13 by not providing transparent information to data subjects about the processing purposes, legal basis, data retention periods, and the existence of profiling, as required when collecting personal data directly from subjects (e.g., when users provide contact data or use recording features).

7. The storage and sharing of voice recordings likely violate the storage limitation principle in Article 5(1)(e), as there is no indication that personal data are kept in a form permitting identification for no longer than necessary, especially given the open-ended nature of sharing with third parties.

8. The controller fails to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security, as required by Article 32, given the reports of security issues and unauthorized access or disclosure risks associated with the recording and sharing features.

9. The controller does not facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights under Articles 15–22, as evidenced by the report received by the DPA, violating Article 12(2) and (3), which obligate controllers to enable rights and respond without undue delay.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Between October 2018 and November 2019, the DPA received 41 complaints regarding FREE, a French communications provider (controller), after which the DPA started an investigation based on 10 of these complaints. Some of these complaints concerned access requests for information regarding the data broker from which the controller got personal data. The controller did not respond to these requests in time or provided incomplete answers. According to the controller, the requests were not answered in time due to human error. However, specifically with regard to information regarding the source of the data, the controller stated that it was not obliged to reveal information that was deemed a 'business secret' according to recital 63 and Article 15(4) GDPR (in this case, the identity of the data broker who supplied the data). The controller also stated that it had recently changed its internal procedure, and now asked its data brokers to also provide the identity of the primary source of the data collection, which the controller could then provide to the data subjects.

The data subjects also requested the deletion of their e-mail accounts. However, the DPA confirmed that data subject’s personal data was still present in the controller’s database after they had submitted their erasure requests. Also, these e-mail accounts still had the status of ‘active’ and data subjects were still able to access their e-mails.

On 8 February 2019, the controller also notified the DPA of a personal data breach. The controller had distributed 4.137 refurbished hardware boxes, called FREE-boxes, to new subscribers. The main use of this FREE-box was to store television programmes, but could also be used to store personal photos and personal video’s. The DPA found that these boxes still contained the personal data of subscribers who had used this hardware previously. The controller did not wipe the data from the device. The controller had accidentally deleted a procedure from its security measures, intended to erase the data stored on the boxes before redistribution. Three years after the breach was reported, 322 boxes were still used by subscribers, without the controller knowing if these boxes contained data of previous subscribers. These boxes were only remotely deactivated by the controller on July 2022, also more than three years after the breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 17, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves FREE, a French communications provider, which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

2. The controller failed to respond to data access requests in a timely manner and provided incomplete answers, specifically regarding the source of personal data obtained from a data broker. According to Article 12(3), the controller must provide information on action taken regarding data subject requests without undue delay and within one month. The controller's delay and incomplete responses violate this requirement.

3. The controller claimed that revealing the identity of the data broker was not obligatory as it constituted a 'business secret' under Recital 63 and Article 15(4). However, Article 15(1)(g) explicitly grants data subjects the right to obtain ""any available information as to their source"" when personal data are not collected from the data subject. The exception in Article 15(4) applies only if such disclosure would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, which must be demonstrated by the controller. The controller's blanket refusal without such demonstration violates Article 15.

4. Data subjects requested erasure of their email accounts under Article 17, but their personal data remained present and accessible in the controller's database after the requests. Article 17(1) requires the controller to erase personal data without undue delay when one of the applicable grounds applies. The controller's failure to do so constitutes a violation of the right to erasure.

5. The controller notified the DPA of a personal data breach on 8 February 2019 involving the distribution of refurbished FREE-boxes containing previous subscribers' personal data. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The accidental deletion of the data wiping procedure represents a failure to maintain such measures.

6. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. While the controller notified the breach, the fact that 322 boxes remained in use with potential personal data for over three years after the breach report indicates inadequate remedial actions, violating the principle of accountability under Article 5(2).

7. The controller only remotely deactivated the affected boxes in July 2022, more than three years after the breach was reported. This delay in taking effective measures to address the breach and mitigate its adverse effects violates Article 33(1) and the general security obligation under Article 32.

8. The combination of violations—failure to properly handle access requests, erasure requests, and implement adequate security measures—demonstrates a lack of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, contrary to Article 24(1) and the accountability principle.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"Based on a notification of a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR by Casa Rusu SRL, a controller, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. During its investigation, the DPA found that the breach was the result of insufficient security measures in the online payments section of the controller's website. The website's data bank stored the bank details of the controller's clients. By using an unauthorized entry in the website's security form, a breach occurred which gave an unauthorized party access to the personal data of the controller's clients and data subjects, namely: the first and last name of bank card holders, their card numbers, the date and year of expiry of the bank cards, and the bank card's CVC code.

The DPA's investigation showed that the controller did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures, both at the time of establishing the means of processing the personal data, and at the time of the processing itself. It also came to light that the controller did not carry out any periodic testing, evaluation, and assessment of the effectiveness of its technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of processing as required to effectively implement the principles of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves Casa Rusu SRL as a controller processing personal data, specifically bank details of clients, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach where unauthorized access was gained to clients' personal data, including first and last names, bank card numbers, expiration dates, and CVC codes, constituting a breach of security leading to unauthorized disclosure as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering factors like the state of the art and the nature of the data. The DPA's investigation found insufficient security measures in the online payments section, specifically an unauthorized entry point in the security form, indicating a failure to implement measures such as encryption or pseudonymization as per Article 32(1)(a).

4. Article 32(1)(d) mandates that controllers implement a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures. The investigation revealed that the controller did not carry out any such periodic testing, which is a direct violation of this requirement.

5. The personal data breached includes sensitive financial information, which heightens the risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms. The lack of adequate security measures violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires processing in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data.

6. The controller's failure to implement measures both at the time of establishing the means of processing and during processing itself contravenes Article 25(1) on data protection by design and by default, which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to effectively implement data protection principles.

7. Therefore, based on the violations of Article 32(1), Article 32(1)(d), Article 5(1)(f), and Article 25(1), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The controller ""Kaufland Romania SCS"", a chain of commercial stores, was alerted by a data subject that a security video recording, containing images of the data subject showing them in the parking lot of one of the stores owned by the controller, appeared on the web page of a local newspaper.

The controller notified the Romanian DPA of the data security breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR, prompting an investigation by the DPA.

The investigation revealed that the store manager allowed an employee access to the monitoring room, who captured, with his personal mobile phone, images of the security video recordings that were playing. The employee sent the recordings to a third party via WhatsApp. Later, the images were made public by an online publication. As a result, the image and registration number of a car were made public. Two data subjects were affected by this incident.

The DPA investigated until November 2022.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 29, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the controller ""Kaufland Romania SCS"" through security video recordings, which capture images of data subjects and vehicle registration numbers, constituting personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) GDPR. Specifically, they allowed unauthorized access to the monitoring room and failed to prevent the copying and dissemination of security footage via personal mobile devices.

3. The employee's actions in capturing and transmitting the personal data via WhatsApp without a lawful basis violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)) and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), as the processing was not for a specified, legitimate purpose.

4. The disclosure of personal data to a third party (the online publication) without the data subjects' consent or another lawful basis under Article 6(1) GDPR constitutes an unauthorized processing operation, infringing on the data subjects' rights to privacy and data protection.

5. The controller did not demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2) GDPR, as they failed to implement measures to ensure and prove compliance with the Regulation, including adequate access controls to sensitive areas like the monitoring room and clear policies on handling security footage.

6. The incident resulted in a personal data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR, as there was an unauthorized disclosure of personal data. While the controller notified the breach under Article 33, the breach itself occurred due to insufficient safeguards, indicating noncompliance with the GDPR's security obligations.

7. The Romanian DPA's investigation confirmed the controller's failure to protect personal data, leading to a verdict of noncompliance and resulting in an administrative fine, underscoring the violation of GDPR provisions.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"During the investigation, the Romanian DPA found that the data controller  did not take adequate organizational measures which led to unlawful disclosure of an Excel record containing the personal data (surname, surname, personal numeric code, telephone number, identity card number and serial number, e-mail address, bank details, real estate purchases, marital status, requested amount, bank, comments) of the data controller's customers and others natural persons (customers' life partners).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 34","1. The case involves a data controller that failed to implement adequate organizational measures, resulting in the unlawful disclosure of an Excel file containing personal data of customers and other natural persons, including sensitive information such as personal numeric code, identity card details, bank information, and marital status.

2. Article 32 of the policy requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The controller's failure to implement such measures constitutes a violation of this article.

3. The disclosed data includes special categories of personal data (marital status) under Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless specific conditions under Article 9(2) are met. The case does not indicate that any of these conditions applied to this processing, resulting in a violation of Article 9.

4. Article 5(1)(f) requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized disclosure. The controller's failure to prevent the disclosure violates this principle of integrity and confidentiality.

5. Article 5(2) establishes the principle of accountability, requiring the controller to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles. The controller's failure to implement adequate organizational measures shows a lack of compliance with this accountability principle.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 32 (security of processing), Article 9 (processing of special categories of data), Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality), and Article 5(2) (accountability)."
"At an unspecified time, the controller, a Romanian water supplier, incurred a data security breach by erroneously putting data subjects' email addresses in the ""To"" section instead of the ""BCC"" section of its email client before sending off an email. The controller subsequently notified the breach to the Romanian DPA, prompting it to launch an investigation. The investigation concluded in December 2022.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a controller (Romanian water supplier) processing personal data (email addresses) of data subjects, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it constitutes automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller incurred a data security breach by erroneously disclosing email addresses to multiple recipients via the ""To"" field instead of using ""BCC"", which constitutes unauthorized disclosure of personal data under the definition of a personal data breach in Article 4(12).

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires personal data to be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized disclosure, using appropriate technical and organizational measures. The controller's failure to implement basic email security measures (proper use of BCC) violates this integrity and confidentiality principle.

4. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The controller's error in using the ""To"" field instead of ""BCC"" demonstrates a failure to implement adequate organizational measures and safeguards for mass email communications.

5. While the controller notified the breach to the Romanian DPA as required by Article 33(1), the breach itself resulted from non-compliance with security obligations under Articles 5(1)(f) and 32.

6. The investigation by the Romanian DPA concluded the controller was responsible for the breach, indicating a failure to demonstrate compliance with the security requirements of the GDPR as required by the accountability principle in Article 5(2).

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"A hotel company, OÜ Laidoneri KV (the controller), installed CCTV cameras visible in three external corners of its Park Hotel Viljandi, the public spaces on the ground floor as well as in the kitchen and the basement floor. The cameras monitored the employees of the hotel (data subjects).

On its own initiative, the Estonian DPA started an investigation with the aim of finding out on what legal basis and for what purpose the CCTV cameras were used. During the proceedings, the controller explained that it used consent as a legal basis through the installation of information signs on the walls of the building, notifying data subjects that surveillance camera were active.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves OÜ Laidoneri KV (the controller) processing personal data of its employees via CCTV surveillance, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data in the context of a controller's establishment in the Union.

2. The controller claimed consent as the legal basis for processing under Article 6(1)(a), obtained through information signs notifying individuals of surveillance. However, for consent to be valid, it must meet the conditions in Article 4(11) and Article 7, requiring it to be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, with the data subject demonstrating affirmative action.

3. Given the employer-employee relationship, there is an inherent imbalance of power, which undermines the freedom of consent. Article 7(4) explicitly states that consent is not freely given if there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and controller, such as in employment contexts. Thus, employees cannot be considered to have freely given consent merely through the presence of information signs.

4. Additionally, Article 6 requires that processing be lawful under one of the specified bases. Since consent is invalid due to the power imbalance, the controller lacks a valid legal basis for processing personal data via CCTV surveillance, violating Article 6.

5. The controller also failed to provide proper information under Articles 13 and 12, as mere signs do not constitute the concise, transparent, and intelligible information required, especially regarding purposes, storage periods, and data subject rights.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller is a manufacturer of heart rate monitors and smart watches offering its services in multiple Member States in the EU and wordwide. Customers (data subjects) had to register for an online service in order to use all the features of the devices, which required personal information, such as gender, height, age and weight. The device collected heart rate, max VO2 (maximum oxygen capacity) as well as BMI (body mass index) information and uploaded them to the online service. Data subjects could use the collected information to analyse training performance.

The Finnish DPA received five complaints from data subjects between 22 May 2018 and 19 February 2019.  The Austrian DPA received one complaint on the same matter. The complaints addressed fours main issues.

First, according to the complaints, the consent to process heart rate data was forced onto the data subjects as the controller made the use of the online service conditional upon granting consent to process heart rate data. If the data subject subseqently withdrew consent, their online service account would be frozen. However, according to the controller, the device was separate from the online service as some basic features were still usable without the online service.

Second, the controller also requested consent for the processing of other personal data, such as max VO2, sleep target time and daily activity target, next to information such as gender, age, height and weight. The controller argued that it was not possible to draw conclusions about a person's health based on this 'raw' data, hence there was no processing of sensitive data other than heart rate data. Allegedly, such conclusions about health would only be possible with the help of medical exminations or additional data.

Third, the complaints questioned the lawfulness of data transfers to third countries. Although the controller's servers were located in the EU, in Finland and Ireland, personal data from the controller's email service would be sent to a server located in the US. For these transfers, the controller used as a legal basis consent under Article 49(1)(a) GDPR (prior to November 2019). The controller submitted that it had asked data subjects for consent to transfer the data to the US in order to make them more aware of the processing carried out by the company.

Fourth, the data subjects noted that while accepting the terms and conditions, they also had to consent to the controller processing ""user-generated content"", that is any content uploaded or transmitted to the online service (e.g. training results) apart from the information initially provided. There was no separate consent form for the processing of user-generated content. This data would be made available globally and also transferred outside the EU. If the data subject withdrew their consent, the user-generated data would not be removed. The data subject could request their deletion only by closing their account.

Because the controller operated in multiple Member States, the cooperation mechanism under Article 60 GDPR was activated. Since the controller's main establishment was located in Finland, the Finnish DPA was the lead supervisory authority (Article 65 GDPR), while the concerned supervisory authorities (Article 4(22) GDPR) were, among others, the Austrian, Belgian, Czech and Danish DPAs. After investigating the controller's processing practices as well as receiving the submissions by the concerned supervisory authorities, the Finnish DPA issued a draft decision pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR. No objections were raised by concerned supervisory authorities, rendering it a binding decision on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 9,"1. The case involves a controller processing personal data through heart rate monitors and smart watches, requiring registration for an online service that collects health-related data such as heart rate, max VO2, and BMI, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of personal data and processing).

2. Regarding the first issue, the controller made consent to process heart rate data a condition for using the online service, and freezing accounts upon withdrawal of consent. This violates Article 7(4) GDPR, as consent is not freely given when the performance of a contract (e.g., providing the online service) is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for that contract. Additionally, Article 7(3) requires that withdrawal of consent must be as easy as giving consent and should not lead to detrimental effects like account freezing, especially if the processing is not essential for basic functionality.

3. For the second issue, the controller processed data such as max VO2, sleep target time, and daily activity target without classifying it as sensitive data. However, such data relates to health and fitness, constituting data concerning health under Article 4(15) GDPR, and thus is a special category of personal data under Article 9(1). Processing this data requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or another exception, but the controller failed to obtain valid explicit consent or apply appropriate safeguards, leading to a violation.

4. Concerning the third issue, the controller transferred personal data to the US based on consent under Article 49(1)(a) GDPR for email services. However, Article 49(1) requires that such transfers be limited to specific situations and not be repetitive or massive. Relying on consent for ongoing transfers without ensuring adequate safeguards or informing data subjects of the risks violates the principles of lawful transfers under Chapter V, particularly Article 44 and Article 49, as consent must be explicit, informed, and specific to the risks involved.

5. For the fourth issue, the controller processed ""user-generated content"" without separate consent and did not delete it upon withdrawal of consent. This violates Article 6 (lawfulness of processing) and Article 7 (conditions for consent), as consent must be specific and informed for each processing purpose. Moreover, Article 17(1)(b) requires erasure of personal data when consent is withdrawn, unless another legal basis applies. The controller's failure to delete such data upon withdrawal constitutes a violation of the right to erasure.

6. The controller's practices were investigated under the cooperation mechanism (Article 60 GDPR), with the Finnish DPA as the lead supervisory authority (Article 56). The draft decision found violations, and no objections were raised by concerned supervisory authorities, making it binding under Article 60(6).

7. Based on the above, the controller failed to comply with multiple provisions of GDPR, including invalid consent, unlawful processing of special categories of data, improper data transfers, and violation of data subject rights. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Alektum Oy has declined to answer data subjects request to review their data. The company also hampered and slowed down the investigation

The case is based on three different reports made to DPA. In two cases data subject didn't receive any replies from the company and in one case data subject got a general reply but not the information requested.

In the case of one data subject, Alektum Oy explained the non-response by saying that it no longer processed personal data of the data subject. DPA stated that even then, the company should have responded to the data subject and inform that they no longer process the data subjects personal data.

In case 6707/154/2018 data subject requested to use his right to be forgotten as defined in article 17. Alektum Oy denied to remove data from their system. DPA hold that controller had right to decline the request because the data subject still had outstanding account for the controllers client and the information was still needed for the purpose it was originally collected. The controller should have inform the data subject when his data would be removed.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 15,"1. The case involves Alektum Oy as a controller processing personal data, and data subjects exercising their rights under GDPR, as per the policy's material scope (Article 2).

2. In two instances, data subjects made requests to exercise their rights (such as access under Article 15), but Alektum Oy did not respond at all, which violates Article 12(3) and (4), as the controller must provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15-22 without undue delay and within one month, or if no action is taken, inform the data subject of the reasons without delay and within one month.

3. In one instance, Alektum Oy provided a general reply but not the specific information requested, which fails to fulfill the right of access under Article 15, as the controller must provide confirmation of processing, access to personal data, and specific information such as purposes, categories of data, recipients, etc., as outlined in Article 15(1).

4. When a data subject no longer had personal data processed, Alektum Oy failed to respond and confirm that no data was being processed, which violates Article 15(1), as the data subject has the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data are being processed.

5. In the case of the right to be forgotten under Article 17 (case 6707/154/2018), Alektum Oy denied the request due to an outstanding account, which might be justified under Article 17(3) exceptions (e.g., for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims). However, the controller should have informed the data subject about when the data would be removed, as per the transparency requirements under Article 12(4) and the principles of fair processing, but it did not do so.

6. Alektum Oy hampered and slowed down the investigation by the DPA, which violates Article 31, as controllers must cooperate with supervisory authorities on request in the performance of their tasks.

7. Therefore, based on multiple violations of GDPR articles, including Article 12, Article 15, and Article 31, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The courier and logistics company PostNord (the controller) offers their customers a service MyPostNord, where they can schedule and track parcels as well as obtain advantages such as faster bookings. MyPostNord can also be accessed through an mobile app.

In February and March 2020, the controller submitted two data breach notifications to the Norwegian DPA, relating to cases where unauthorised persons were able to access customer profiles of others. The unauthorised persons were able to access the profiles because the controller used phone numbers as the only means of authentication. Entering someone else's number (for example an incorrect one) could give them access to other persons' personal data, including name, gender, postal address, email address, phone number, order- and payment history, shipments underway and sender name. The same happened in cases where there was a new owner of the phone number previously used in the MyPostNord service and where the pervious owner of the same phone number did not update their profile information.

In addition to the controller's breach notifications, the DPA received information from the public about similar incidents. The DPA initiated an investigation and requested information from the controller. Specifically, the DPA asked for the risk assessment of the service MyPostNord and related processing systems. The controller submitted the risk assessment, but could not state when the risk assessment was conducted.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves PostNord as a data controller offering the MyPostNord service, which processes personal data including names, addresses, contact details, and order history, falling under the scope of GDPR as defined in Article 4 (definitions of 'personal data' and 'processing') and Article 2 (material scope).

2. The controller used phone numbers as the sole authentication method, allowing unauthorized access to customer profiles when incorrect numbers were entered or when phone numbers were reassigned to new users without proper verification, resulting in exposure of personal data.

3. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access. The authentication method used was insufficient to prevent such access, violating Article 32(1) and (2).

4. Article 5(1)(f) mandates that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing. The breaches demonstrate a failure to meet this integrity and confidentiality principle.

5. Article 24 requires controllers to implement measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR, considering the nature, scope, and risks of processing. The controller's inability to specify when the risk assessment was conducted indicates inadequate implementation of such measures.

6. Article 35 requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) where processing is likely to result in high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. The authentication vulnerability and subsequent breaches indicate high risk, yet the controller's risk assessment was not timely or sufficient, violating Article 35(1) and (7).

7. The breaches involved unauthorized access to special categories of data (e.g., potentially revealing gender, which could relate to special categories under Article 9), though not explicitly stated, but primarily involve personal data requiring protection under Articles 5 and 32.

8. The controller failed to adhere to the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) by not demonstrating effective security measures and risk management, as evidenced by the recurring breaches and inadequate risk assessment.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 24, 32, and 35."
"On an unspecified date, a logistics firm (controller) notified the Romanian DPA of two data breaches in line with Article 33 GDPR. Following the notifications, the DPA launched an investigation which concluded that the security breaches were caused by the theft of a bookshelf containing the files of 12 employees. The theft allowed unauthorised third parties access the personal data contained therein. The breach occurred on 3 June 2021 and included data concerning contact information, academic and professional training, employment details, information on tax deductions and dependents, and employees' health status. The DPA concluded the investigation in December 2022.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves a logistics firm (controller) processing personal data of employees, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment in the Union.

2. The processed data included employees' health status, which constitutes special category data under Article 9(1) GDPR, as it reveals information concerning health.

3. The controller experienced a security breach involving the theft of physical files containing personal data, which constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR, defined as ""a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data.""

4. Article 32(1) GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorised access to physical materials. The theft of a bookshelf containing employee files indicates a failure to implement adequate physical security measures.

5. Article 5(1)(f) GDPR requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing. The physical theft resulting in unauthorized access to personal data constitutes a violation of this integrity and confidentiality principle.

6. For special category data, Article 9(1) GDPR establishes a general prohibition, with exceptions under Article 9(2). The processing of health data without appropriate safeguards violates the heightened protection requirements for special categories of data.

7. Article 33(1) GDPR requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. While the controller did notify the DPA, the investigation revealed underlying security deficiencies that caused the breach.

8. The DPA's investigation concluded that the security breaches were caused by inadequate physical protection measures, specifically the theft of a bookshelf containing files. This represents a failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures as required by Article 32(1) GDPR.

9. The case involves multiple violations of GDPR provisions, including failures to implement appropriate security measures (Article 32), protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal data (Article 5(1)(f)), and provide adequate protection for special category data (Article 9).

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Controller is a law firm whose main services consist of providing legal advice to clients injured in traffic accidents and representing them in court proceedings concerning damages. In the course of these activities, the controller interacted with potential clients (data subjects) in order to assess their legal situation as well as possibilities of taking their cases on board. Before interacting with the data subjects, the controller would verbally ask for consent to process the personal data of the data subjects. However, there was no evidence available of obtaining such a consent. Based on an oral declaration and before concluding any contract, the controller would obtain the following information from the data subjects: name, surname, telephone number, e-mail address, information about the death of another person, and health data related to traffic accidents.

In February 2022, the Polish DPA initiated ex officio proceedings in order to investigate the controller's data processing activities with regard to potential clients.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves a law firm (controller) processing personal data of potential clients (data subjects) including sensitive categories such as health data and information about deceased persons, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of personal data and processing).

2. The controller relied on verbal consent for processing personal data without maintaining evidence of such consent, which violates Article 7(1) requiring controllers to be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing.

3. The processed data includes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (health data and data related to deceased persons in the context of accidents), which requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or another exception. The verbal consent obtained does not meet the standard of explicit consent as it was not documented or obtained in a manner that ensures informed and unambiguous indication.

4. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects as required by Article 13, which mandates that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, and other details, which was not done in writing or through other means ensuring clarity.

5. The processing of special categories of data without a valid exception under Article 9(2) and without appropriate safeguards violates the principles of lawfulness and proportionality under Article 5(1)(a) and (c).

6. The controller did not maintain records of processing activities as required by Article 30, which is obligatory for controllers to demonstrate compliance, especially when processing sensitive data.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations including lack of demonstrable consent, improper processing of special categories of data, and failure to adhere to transparency and accountability principles."
"The Church of Norway (the controller) used information about new births from the National Population Register disclosed on the basis of national law, including sensitive data. If at least one parent was an existing member of the Church, the controller was allowed to register newborns (as 'affiliated persons') in their member register and, on the same condition, they also had permission as per the national population regulations to receive automatic notifications on newborns. This permission expired on 1 October 2018, and on 1 January 2021 the other relevant regulations were replaced.

The controller, however, still continued to receive the automatic notifications until 14 November 2018. At this point, they still considered that the minors registered during the period 1 October to 14 November were correctly registered as per the (now expired) Norwegian Church law, and did not delete the data.

On 28 February 2020 the Norwegian Humanist Association and lawfirm Bull & Co lodged a complaint with the Norwegian DPA on behalf of eight data subjects, claiming that the controller had unlawfully collected information on the data subjects' newborns and failed to inform them about this processing. Consequently, the DPA launched an investigation.

Only when the controller realised that the correct end date was 1 October, it initiated an erasure process, but due to a claimed technical error, this was not carried out until 18 August 2020. The controller informed the DPA that the personal data on affiliated persons would be deleted when the legal basis for this processing expired on 1 January 2021. On 22 January 2021, it informed that the personal data of 108.880 data subjects were deleted. With regard to the alleged lack of information issue, the controller claimed that it could rely on the exemption set forth in Article 14(5)(c) GDPR and noted that it still provided some information through the main privacy notice for the Church, as well as on local websites.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 14, Article 17, Article 58","1. The case involves the Church of Norway as a data controller processing personal data of newborns, including sensitive data (religious affiliation), which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope) and Article 4 (Definitions of 'personal data' and 'sensitive data').

2. The controller processed personal data without a valid legal basis after 1 October 2018, when the national law permission expired. Under GDPR Article 6(1), processing is lawful only if it satisfies at least one condition, such as legal obligation or legitimate interests. The controller lacked any valid basis after this date, making processing unlawful.

3. The processing involved special categories of data (religious affiliation) under Article 9(1), which requires explicit consent or specific exceptions under Article 9(2). The controller did not obtain explicit consent nor qualify for any exception after the national law basis expired, violating Article 9.

4. The controller failed to provide information to data subjects as required by Article 14, which mandates that where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information. The controller claimed exemption under Article 14(5)(c), but this exemption applies only if obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member State law. Since the national law permission had expired, this exemption did not apply, and the controller violated Article 14(1)-(3).

5. The controller delayed erasure of personal data after realizing the legal basis had expired. Under Article 17(1)(a), data must be erased without undue delay when no longer necessary for the purposes collected. The controller's failure to erase until August 2020, despite awareness of the expiry, constitutes a violation of the right to erasure.

6. The controller's actions also violated the principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e), as personal data was kept longer than necessary without a legal basis.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations including lack of legal basis for processing (Article 6), unlawful processing of sensitive data (Article 9), failure to provide information (Article 14), and failure to erase data without undue delay (Article 17)."
"The data subject applied for a vacant position at the company H.M.B. EAD (controller). After signing some paperwork, the data subject and the controller agreed to another meeting in order to finalise the employment contract. On 28 April 2021, before such meeting took place, the controller sent the papers signed by the data subject to the 'National Revenue agency' (NRA).  According to Article 62(5) of the Bulgarian Labour code, an employer had to notify the NRA within three days of signing/closing the employement contract. In the end, the data subject did not complete the application procedure.

The data subject stated that she had been registered as an unemployed person on 8 February 2021 and had been granted unemployment benefits for three months. However, the benefits suddenly stopped, which is why the data subject checked with the social insurance institution for the cause of this issue. Here, she discovered that the controller had filed the signed papers as an employment contract, which had made her ineligible to receive further unemployment benefits.

The data subject filed a complaint at the Bulgarian DPA, stating that the controller unlawfully processed her data by submitting an employment contract without her knowledge. The data subject stated that she did not sign any employment contract and did not provide any personal data to the controller.

The controller stated that the allegations of the data subject were false. It stated that on 17 April 2021, the data subject had provided her CV to the controller in order to apply for a vacant job position. The controller did not deny that an employment contract had not formally been signed yet, but stated that the job-offer documents contained all the aspects of an employment contract and could therefore be regarded as such. This was also the reason why the company submitted the documents to the NRA pursuant to Article 62(5) of the Labour code. The signed documents also included a declaration of consent by the data subject to process her personal data. These documents contained several categories of personal data, such as full name, unique nationality number, address, identity card number, email, a photograph and a telephone number.

In response to these arguments, the data subject admitted that she had sent the CV and signed a consent for the processing of her data. However, she kept insisting that she did not sign any employment contract.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data by H.M.B. EAD (the controller) concerning a data subject who applied for a job, as defined under Article 4(1) and (2) of the policy (GDPR).

2. The controller processed several categories of the data subject's personal data, including her full name, unique nationality number, address, identity card number, email, photograph, and telephone number, which were contained in the signed documents (Article 4(1)).

3. The controller claimed the legal basis for this processing was the data subject's consent, as referenced in the signed documents (Article 6(1)(a)). However, for consent to be valid, it must be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"" (Article 4(11)) and meet the conditions set out in Article 7.

4. The data subject's consent, as described, was given in the context of a job application and related paperwork. The subsequent processing—submitting this data to the National Revenue Agency (NRA) as an employment contract notification—constituted processing for a new purpose (fulfilling a legal obligation under the Labour Code) that was different from the original purpose of the job application (Article 5(1)(b), Principle of purpose limitation).

5. Article 6(4) requires that for any processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were initially collected, the controller must ascertain whether the new purpose is compatible with the initial purpose. The controller failed to demonstrate that such an assessment was made or that the new processing was compatible with the original purpose of processing the job application. Submitting data to a government revenue agency as a formal employment notification is not a necessary or compatible extension of reviewing a job application, especially since the data subject insists no final employment contract was signed.

6. The controller processed the data subject's information based on its own interpretation that the signed documents constituted an employment contract, despite the data subject's explicit denial and the fact that a final meeting to formalize the contract had not occurred. This represents a failure to ensure the accuracy of the data (Article 5(1)(d)), as the data processed (the submission to the NRA stating an employment relationship existed) was factually inaccurate.

7. The processing operation (submission to the NRA) was based on Article 6(1)(c) (compliance with a legal obligation). However, the legal obligation in Article 62(5) of the Bulgarian Labour Code is triggered by the signing/closing of an employment contract. By the data subject's account, which the controller did not conclusively refute, this condition was not met. Therefore, the controller lacked a valid legal basis for the processing under Article 6(1)(c), as the purported legal obligation was not actually applicable.

8. Consequently, the processing of the data subject's personal data for the purpose of notifying the NRA was unlawful, as it was not based on a valid legal basis under Article 6 and violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, purpose limitation, and accuracy outlined in Article 5(1)(a), (b), and (d).

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen (the controllers) used Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, with servers located in the US, as a tracking technology tool on their online system (https://helmet.fi) of public libraries to monitor visitors and improve the service. The controllers installed cookie tracking technologies on the data subjects' terminal devices as soon as the website was accessed, even before a cookie banner would be shown to them. Information about processing of personal data was available on the library website under the ""About the website"" link. However, this general privacy note would not inform data subjects about data transfers to the US, but only mention that ""some service providers are located outside of the EU/EEA"" without specific information on the recipients in third countries. Information about the tracking technologies was also provided under the heading ""Cookies"".

In light of the CJEU Schrems II judgement, the Finnish DPA started an ex officio investigation into the controllers' data transfers to third countries. The DPA considered four main issues: legal basis for processing of personal data collected through tracking technology tools, information given to data subjects related to the use of tracking technologies, implementation of technical and organisational measures for sharing data on search results with third parties, legal basis for data transfers to third countries.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32, Article 44, Article 46, Article 13","1. The controllers (cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen) installed cookie tracking technologies on data subjects' devices immediately upon website access, before displaying any cookie banner or obtaining consent. This processing of personal data through tracking technologies lacks a valid legal basis under Article 6, as consent was not obtained prior to processing, violating the requirement that processing must be lawful under Article 5(1)(a).

2. The information provided to data subjects about data transfers was insufficient under Articles 13 and 14. The privacy notice only mentioned that ""some service providers are located outside of the EU/EEA"" without specifically identifying Google as the recipient in the US or providing information about appropriate safeguards as required by Articles 13(1)(f) and 14(1)(f) for transfers to third countries.

3. The data transfers to the United States using Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager occurred without implementing adequate safeguards under Chapter V. Following the Schrems II judgement, transfers to the US require additional measures beyond Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure equivalent protection, which were not implemented or documented by the controllers, violating Articles 44-49 regarding transfers to third countries.

4. The controllers failed to conduct a proper data protection impact assessment under Article 35 for the processing operations involving tracking technologies and data transfers to a third country that lacks an adequacy decision, particularly given the large-scale monitoring of website visitors and the sensitive nature of library search data.

5. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"M&M Inkasso OÜ (the controller) was a debt collection company, which published information about debtors (data subjects), including names and photographs, on its website and social media (Facebook, Instagram and TikTok) as a form of retaliation.

After receiving a tip from the public about the social media activities of the controller, the Estonian DPA started an ex officio investigation. During the proceedings, the controller explained that the publication was justified by ""vital interests"". Specifically, the posted content was supposed to prevent malicious exploitation of those who could get in contact with debtors. The controller also submitted that it had taken into consideration all other necessary legal considerations with a view to avoiding legal infringements and all information published on the company's website and social media was taken from the Internet and freely available.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves M&M Inkasso OÜ as a data controller processing personal data (names and photographs of debtors) through publication on its website and social media platforms, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'processing' and 'personal data'.

2. The controller claimed justification under ""vital interests"" (Article 6(1)(d)), but debt collection activities do not typically involve protecting someone's vital interests (i.e., matters of life and death), making this lawful basis invalid for this processing purpose.

3. The publication of photographs constitutes processing of biometric data under Article 9(1), which is prohibited unless a specific exception applies. No exception under Article 9(2) is met here, as the processing was not necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, vital interests, or with explicit consent.

4. The processing violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as publishing debtor information as retaliation is neither fair nor transparent to data subjects.

5. The processing violates the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b), as debt collection does not inherently require public shaming through social media and website publication.

6. The processing violates the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), as publishing photographs and identities is excessive for legitimate debt collection purposes.

7. The controller failed to provide proper information to data subjects about the processing as required under Articles 13 and 14, particularly regarding the legal basis and purpose of publication.

8. The controller did not respect data subjects' rights under Articles 15-22, including the right to object (Article 21) and right to erasure (Article 17), by making data publicly available without adequate mechanisms for withdrawal or removal.

9. The argument that data was ""freely available on the internet"" does not override GDPR requirements under Article 6, as reprocessing personal data from public sources still requires a lawful basis and compliance with all principles.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Following a report received from the police on 15 July 2020, the Italian DPA sent two requests for information to the owner of Naija Market International, the controller, a company engaged in the grocery business in Modena. These requests sought further information regarding the installation of a video surveillance system on store premises. After the controller did not comply with the requests, the Italian DPA carried out an inspection at the controller's two operating sites, which revealed the presence of video surveillance cameras filming interior spaces of the establishments and therefore potentially suitable for monitoring the work activities of the controller's employees. The cameras were operating in the absence of the appropriate information signs, an alleged violation the Article 5(1)(a) GDPR principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and the transparency obligations in Article 13 GDPR. Furthermore, the surveillance system was installed without first obtaining permission from the territorially competent Labour Department, in violation of Italian Law.

Responding to the allegations, the controller claimed to be unaware of the obligation to inform the Labour department and, because they are a foreign national, unable to understand the particularly technical data protection regulation. Moreover, the controller argued that the conduct involved only 3 employees, and therefore this was only a minor violation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 58","1. The case involves a controller (Naija Market International) processing personal data through video surveillance of employees, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to provide appropriate information signs about the video surveillance, violating the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, which requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.

3. The absence of information signs also constitutes a violation of Article 13 GDPR, which mandates that where personal data are collected from the data subject (here, through direct observation), the controller must provide specific information including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, and other necessary details at the time of data collection.

4. The controller's claim of being unaware of obligations due to being a foreign national does not excuse non-compliance, as Article 24 GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance regardless of their background, and ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.

5. The controller's argument that the violation only involved 3 employees and was minor is irrelevant, as the GDPR applies to processing regardless of the scale when it involves personal data (Article 2), and the obligations under Articles 5 and 13 are not contingent on the number of data subjects.

6. The installation of surveillance without Labor Department permission under Italian law represents an additional violation of national provisions that complement the GDPR, but the core GDPR violations (Articles 5 and 13) are sufficient to establish non-compliance.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of the transparency principle (Article 5(1)(a)) and specific information obligations (Article 13)."
"On 21 September 2021, the data subject opened a bank account, which he closed again less than two months after, on 5 November 2021. On the same day, he also requested the deletion of his data. According to the data subject, this request was denied on 19 November 2021. On 7 December 2021, the data subject received an offer from the controller by e-mail for a consumer loan, despite the fact he was no longer a customer of the controller and did not use any of its services anymore. The data subject submitted a complaint at the Bulgarian DPA (DPA) because of the unlawful processing of his personal data for direct marketing purposes.

During the proceedings, the controller confirmed that the marketing e-mail was sent but stated that this had been the result of an error, caused by an additional safety mechanism implemented by the controller. This mechanism was designed for customers who closed their accounts unusually quickly, which was in less than three months. The controller had to retain certain information of former clients in order to comply with the national Anti-Money Laundering Act. Since the data subject had only been a client for less than two months, his data was kept but subsequently included in the list for direct marketing e-mails. The controller emphasised that a minimal amount of personal data was processed as a result of this error (first name and e-mail address) and that the data subject had not been profiled.

The controller also explained that for its commercial campaigns, it had several criteria to exclude e-mail addresses from its mailing list. The first criterion was to determine whether the status of the customer was 'active' or 'inactive'. If the status was 'inactive', the e-mail address belonged to a former customer and would not be included in the list. The second criterion was when a data subject had refused to receive direct marketing from the controller. In that case, the respective e-mail address would also not be included in the mailing list.

Because of the safety mechanism, the status of the data subject was still 'active' despite the fact he was no longer a customer of the controller. Because he also did not object to personalised marketing when he had opened his bank account, his e-mail address was included in the mailing list.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 24,"1. The data subject closed his bank account and requested deletion of his personal data on 5 November 2021, exercising his right to erasure under Article 17 of the GDPR.
2. The controller denied the deletion request, citing compliance with the national Anti-Money Laundering Act, which may be justified under Article 17(3)(b) for retention based on legal obligations.
3. However, the controller processed the data subject's personal data (first name and email address) for direct marketing purposes by sending a consumer loan offer on 7 December 2021, which is a separate purpose from AML compliance.
4. Processing for direct marketing requires a lawful basis under Article 6, such as consent or legitimate interests. The controller relied on the data subject not objecting initially, but after account closure and deletion request, any prior consent should be considered withdrawn under Article 7(3), and legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) may not override the data subject's rights since the relationship had ended.
5. Article 21(2) provides the data subject with the right to object to processing for direct marketing at any time, and processing must cease upon objection. The deletion request implies an objection to further processing, including marketing.
6. The controller's error in maintaining the data subject's status as ""active"" due to a safety mechanism led to processing for marketing without a valid lawful basis, violating the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).
7. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that personal data is not processed for purposes other than those necessary, as required by Article 25 (data protection by design and by default), specifically to prevent such errors.
8. The processing for direct marketing also violates the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), as data retained for AML compliance was used for unrelated marketing purposes.
9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The controller is a news service provider. Data subjects subscribed to its service to receive daily news and updates through a newsletter. It was not clarified whether this was a paid service. The controller relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the data for the newsletter.

The controller also processed personal data for electronic direct marketing (eDM) and a prize draw. The eDM emails were sent to everyone who subscribed to the service. The prize draw was advertised by the controller in the period between 24 February 2022 to 24 March 2022. The controller wanted to offer the prize draw's prize to all service subscribers. Therefore, all the service users were subscribed to the prize draw and there was no way for them to opt out of the prize draw.

On 24 June 2022, the DPA opened an ex officio investigation into a controller's services. According to the facts uncovered by the DPA, between January 1, 2021 and May 17, 2022, all subscribers who registered online for the news service were automatically subscribed to eDM. A single checkbox on the website was used to accept the Terms of Service (TOS) - a condition of the subscription - and to subscribe to eDM. At the time of subscription. In other words, it was not possible to subscribe to the service through the website alone without subscribing to eDM. In its defense, the controller argued that the data processing could be legitimized through legitimate interests.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 7, Article 12","1. The controller processes personal data for electronic direct marketing (eDM) and a prize draw, in addition to the newsletter service. For the newsletter, the controller relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, which may be lawful as it is necessary for the performance of a contract. However, for eDM and the prize draw, the controller automatically subscribes all service users without providing a separate opt-out mechanism, and uses a single checkbox that bundles acceptance of Terms of Service (TOS) with subscription to eDM, making it impossible to subscribe to the service without also subscribing to eDM.

2. According to Article 7 of the GDPR, consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Specifically, Article 7 states that when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether the performance of a contract is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. In this case, processing for eDM is not necessary for the provision of the news service, so conditioning service subscription on consent to eDM means consent is not freely given.

3. The controller argued that processing could be legitimized through legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f). However, for direct marketing purposes, such as eDM, consent is typically required, and legitimate interests cannot override the requirement for freely given consent. Moreover, Article 21 GDPR provides data subjects with the right to object to processing for direct marketing at any time, which was not facilitated here as users were automatically enrolled without an opportunity to object initially.

4. For the prize draw, users were automatically enrolled without any consent mechanism or information provided at the time of subscription, violating Article 6 GDPR, which requires a lawful basis for processing. Since no consent was obtained and no other lawful basis applies (e.g., the prize draw is not necessary for the contract), this processing is unlawful.

5. Article 13 GDPR requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide information about the purposes of processing, including any direct marketing. The controller failed to adequately inform users about the eDM and prize draw processing at the time of data collection, as the single checkbox did not clearly distinguish between TOS and eDM consent.

6. The investigation by the DPA confirmed that between January 1, 2021, and May 17, 2022, all subscribers were automatically subscribed to eDM with no option to avoid it, which directly contravenes the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

7. Therefore, the processing of personal data for eDM and the prize draw lacks a valid lawful basis under Article 6 GDPR, and the consent obtained is invalid under Article 7 GDPR, making the controller's actions noncompliant with the GDPR.

8. Thus, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On April 2020 an early childhood education unit (pre-school) sent an inquiry along with an informational letter regarding activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The families were asked to return the form, providing personal data (including the child's social security number) and stating whether they could arrange childcare at home during the pandemic.

A letter accompanying the inquiry form stated that handling personal data is based on consent and that the data subject gives consent by returning the form. In reality many parents were told that returning the questionnaire was mandatory.

The controller responded to the DPA's request for information, stating that returning the inquiry form was voluntary but strongly desirable. The information was needed to arrange activities during exceptional circumstances due to the COVID pandemic. The controller agreed that the voluntary nature of the inquiry could have been more clearly communicated. They also explained that employees had been given general guidelines for handling personal data, but not specific guidelines for this particular situation.

The controller identified Article 6(1)(c) GDPR (necessary for compliance with a legal obligation) as the legal basis for the processing of personal data in this case. Their statement asserted that they needed the information in order to arrange day care for children, accounting for the number of students learning from home, and to arrange lessons in small groups where possible. They also claimed that they required the information in order to refund families if a child was not attending the activities due to the pandemic. However, the controller agreed that a child's social security number was not a necessary piece of information, and that their age would have been enough to verify the identity of the child.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13","1. The case involves a controller (the early childhood education unit) processing personal data of children and their families, including sensitive information such as social security numbers, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of personal data).

2. The controller claimed that processing was based on consent (as stated in the informational letter) but simultaneously treated the return of the form as mandatory, which contradicts the requirement for consent to be freely given under Article 7(4) (conditions for consent), which states that consent should not be conditional if the processing is not necessary for the performance of a contract.

3. The controller later cited Article 6(1)(c) (compliance with a legal obligation) as the legal basis but failed to specify the exact legal obligation that necessitated the processing, violating Article 6(3), which requires that the legal basis be laid down by Union or Member State law.

4. The processing of social security numbers, which are identifiers, was not necessary for the stated purposes (arranging childcare, refunds, or group lessons), as the controller admitted that age would have sufficed for identification. This violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) (personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary).

5. The controller failed to clearly communicate the voluntary nature of the inquiry, breaching the transparency requirements under Article 12 (transparent information) and Article 13 (information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject), which mandate that data subjects be informed in a clear and plain manner about the voluntary or mandatory nature of data provision.

6. The controller provided only general guidelines to employees on data handling, without specific instructions for this processing scenario, which undermines the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the requirement for appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 24 (responsibility of the controller).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations, including invalid legal basis, lack of transparency, unnecessary data processing, and insufficient organizational measures."
"The controller is Luka Inc, a US-based company that developed and operated Replika, an AI-powered chatbot.

According to the controller, Replika can improve the user's mood and emotional well-being by helping them understand their thoughts and feelings, keep track of their mood, learn coping skills (i.e., stress control), calm anxiety, and work towards goals such as positive thinking, stress management, socialising, and finding love. In other words, Replika provides a kind of 'virtual friend' that users can configure as friend, partner or mentor.

Various reports were published in Italian media concerning inappropriate content on the Replika app, which would pose concrete risks particularly to minors and emotionally vulnerable people. Subsequently, the Italian DPA conducted an investigation focusing on the collection of personal data and the app’s age verification mechanisms.

The investigation revealed that, regardless of what the company stated in its privacy policy or terms of service, no age verification procedure was in place when users created an account. Moreover, the controller had not implemented any blocking method for users who could be believed to be underage during the use of Replika, for example based on the content of their responses.

The investigation also showed that the privacy policy failed to disclose information on the key elements of the processing, in particular the legal grounds and the use of children’s personal data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 8, Article 9, Article 13, Article 58","1. The case involves Luka Inc, a US-based company operating as a controller for the Replika AI chatbot, processing personal data of users in the EU, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3(2) since it offers services to data subjects in the Union.

2. The investigation revealed that no age verification mechanism was implemented during account creation or during use of the service, despite the app being accessible to minors. This violates Article 8(1) of GDPR, which requires that for information society services offered directly to children, processing of personal data of a child below the age of 16 (or lower age set by Member States, such as 14 in Italy) is only lawful if consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility, and the controller must make reasonable efforts to verify such consent.

3. The privacy policy failed to disclose key information about the processing, including the legal grounds and the use of children’s personal data. This violates Article 13(1) and (2), which require controllers to provide specific information to data subjects at the time of data collection, such as the purposes and legal basis for processing, and additional information necessary for fair and transparent processing, including details relevant to children’s data.

4. The lack of age verification and appropriate safeguards also contravenes the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25, which requires controllers to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure that processing meets GDPR requirements and protects data subjects' rights, particularly for vulnerable individuals like minors.

5. The processing of personal data without proper legal grounds and transparency infringes Article 5(1)(a), which mandates that processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent. The absence of age checks and inadequate privacy policies make the processing unfair and non-transparent.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 8, 13, 25, and 5."
"Based on a data subject's complaint, the Romanian DPA started investigations into a dental practice and a collaborating dentist (the controllers). The data subject had alleged that they had disclosed his health data online without his consent.

During the investigations the DPA was able to confirm the data subject's allegations. It found that the controllers disclosed medical information concerning the data subject's orthodontic treatment, consisting of a set of photographs and radiographs that could be correlated with the person's name, by in a published article on a specialized blog. The personal data had been  published for scientific and commercial purposes.

In contradiction to Article 33 GDPR, despite the fact that the dental practice was informed by the data subject about the unauthorized disclosure of his personal health data, the controller did not notify DPA within 72 hours of the security breach.

At the same time, the DPA found that the collaborating dentist published personal data regarding the state of health of the data subject in an article posted in a personal blog, without obtaining the express consent of to the data subject and without informing the data subject.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 33","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, specifically health data (photographs, radiographs, and medical information) by a dental practice and a collaborating dentist, who qualify as data controllers under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The controllers processed special categories of personal data (health data) by publishing them online. Article 9(1) prohibits the processing of such data, with exceptions provided in Article 9(2). The controllers did not obtain the data subject's explicit consent as required by Article 9(2)(a), nor did they rely on any other valid exception under Article 9(2) for this processing.

3. The processing (publication) lacked a lawful basis under Article 6. The controllers did not obtain valid consent from the data subject for this specific purpose, violating the conditions for consent outlined in Articles 6(1)(a) and 7. The performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b)) is not applicable as publication is not necessary for dental treatment. The legitimate interests basis (Article 6(1)(f)) is overridden by the data subject's fundamental rights, especially given the sensitive nature of the data.

4. The controllers failed to provide transparent information to the data subject about the processing of their personal data for publication purposes, as required by Articles 13 and 14.

5. The unauthorized disclosure of personal data constitutes a personal data breach, defined in Article 4(12) as a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data.

6. The dental practice, upon being informed of this breach by the data subject, failed to notify the Romanian Supervisory Authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as mandatorily required by Article 33(1).

7. The publication of the data subject's personal health data for commercial purposes (in addition to stated scientific purposes) further demonstrates a violation of the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), as the data was collected for treatment purposes and further processed for incompatible purposes without a legal basis.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The TV2 Media Group Ltd., the controller, is one of Hungary's largest content providers. It operates several TV channels and online streaming services and has two websites tv2play.hu and tenyek.hu. ""Tenyek.hu"" contains predominantly news content, while ""tv2play.hu"" focuses on various audiovisual media content. In 2021, they had between 1.6 million and 2.4 million monthly visitors and a net revenue of  49,000,000,000 HUF (approx. €127,000,000).

Based on a ""public interest notification"" the Hungarian DPA started an ex officio investigation into the data processing of the websites. There was a concern that the controller did not provide data subjects with adequate information about the processing and that the consent management platform (CMP) on the websites did not collect the consent of data subjects in a transparent and clear manner.

The investigation revealed a number of potential data protection deficits.

The CMP of the controller offered data subject's with the possibility to give consent to cookies by clicking an ""OK, continue"" button. However, the only alternative was a ""more options"" button which redirected to a second level of the CMP with more information and more detailed consent options. On this second level of the CMP, users were provided with two tabs for different categories of processing. On one tab, the user was able to give ""consent"" to different processing purposes. The other tab was titled ""legitimate interest"" and allowed the data subjects to object to data processing. Confusingly, the processes listed in both tabs was almost completely identical. They included purposes such as ""selection of basic ads"", ""Measuring ad performance"", and ""creating a personalized advertising profile"". The processing purposes """"storing and/or accessing information stored on the device"""" was only listed under the consent tab.

Regarding the meaning of ""legitimate interest"" the controller explained that, the way in which it is used on the website, the term would not relate to the legal basis under the GDPR but was meant as a ""category"". Consequently, the controller also had made no interest assessment.

Lastly, it was unclear to the DPA how consent could be withdrawn, once it had been given.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13","1. The case involves TV2 Media Group Ltd. as a data controller processing personal data through its websites, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processing'.

2. The controller's consent management platform (CMP) design with an ""OK, continue"" button as the primary option and ""more options"" as the alternative violates Article 7(4) which states that consent should not be bundled with other matters, and Article 4(11) requiring consent to be a clear affirmative action. The design makes refusal more difficult than acceptance, undermining freedom of choice.

3. The identical processing purposes listed under both ""consent"" and ""legitimate interest"" tabs create confusion about the legal basis for processing, violating Article 5(1)(a) principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, and Article 6 which requires a clear legal basis for processing.

4. The controller's admission that no legitimate interest assessment was conducted violates Article 6(1)(f) which requires controllers to demonstrate compelling legitimate interests that override data subjects' rights when using this legal basis.

5. The failure to provide clear information about processing purposes and legal bases violates Article 13 requirements to inform data subjects about the purposes and legal basis for processing at the time of data collection.

6. The unclear process for withdrawing consent violates Article 7(3) which requires that it be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it, and Article 12(2) which mandates that controllers facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.

7. The processing of personal data for purposes like ""creating a personalized advertising profile"" without proper legal basis and transparent information violates Article 5 principles and Article 6 lawful processing requirements.

8. The scale of processing (1.6-2.4 million monthly visitors) and revenue (€127 million) indicates the processing is not minor, making these violations particularly significant under the accountability principle in Article 5(2).

9. The cumulative effect of these violations demonstrates a systematic failure to comply with multiple GDPR provisions regarding lawful processing, transparency, consent requirements, and data subject rights.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The company SATS ASA (the controller) is a provider of fitness and training services. It has its headquarters in Norway and is also active in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The company has over 270 clubs, about 9,000 employees and more than 700,000 members.

According to one of these members (data subject 1), the controller had transferred their personal data to other companies within its corporate group in May 2018. The controller had also transferred data to Facebook, which was located outside the EU/EEA, without a proper legal ground. This data subject further claimed that an access request, submitted on 29 August 2018, had remained unanswered. Data subject 1 filed a complaint at the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) on 2 October 2018.

Another member (data subject 2), who had already terminated their membership, claimed that the controller had not responded to an access request (Article 15 GDPR), which was submitted on 25 February 2019. The controller had also refused to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR) submitted on the same date. Data subject 2 filed a complaint at the DPA on 1 March 2019.

Another member (data subject 3), who had also terminated their membership, claimed that the controller had refused to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR), which was submitted on 05 October 2019. Data subject 3 filed a complaint at the DPA on 07 October 2019.

On 7 September 2021 and 5 October 2021, the DPA formally approached the controller and asked the company to express its views on the issues raised in Complaint No 2 and Complaint No 3. The controller replied on 1 December 2021.

On 8 December 2021, the DPA received yet another complaint from a member (data subject 4) concerning the controller’s refusal to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR), submitted on 6 August 2021.

On 23 March 2022, the DPA sent further questions to the controller on all of the above complaints and received the controller’s response on 28 April 2022.

Despite receiving the complaints over a fairly long time period, the DPA decided to handle the complaints jointly, considering the fact that all of them concerned similar alleged infringements. Another reason the DPA opted to handle the complaints jointly was 'procedural efficiency'.

On 26 September 2022, after their investigation, the DPA sent the controller an advance notification of their intention to issue an administrative fine of NOK10,000,000 (ten million) (Around €916,000) for violating several GDPR provisions.

The controller responded to the DPA on 31 October 2022 and argued, among other things, that It was ""arbitrary from the part of Datatilsynet (DPA) to [find] a violation of Article 12(3) GDPR and Article 15 GDPR due to a failure to respond to an access request that was submitted around a month after the GDPR became applicable in Norway, as at that time many companies experienced challenges in applying the new rules"".

The controller also stated that the DPA's conclusion that the controller violated both Article 12(3) GDPR and Article 15 GDPR would violate the principle of ne bis in idem.

The controller also argued that the assessment of the necessity of a storage period is to a large extent discretionary, noting that the DPA was not in the position to do this and should refrain from questioning the assessment made by the controller. The controller made the same statement concerning the choice of legal bases.

Despite the controller's arguments, the DPA submitted a draft decision on 30 December 2022 to the other supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, which was in line with the above advance notification. The DPA did not receive any relevant and reasoned objections and, consequently, upheld their advance notification.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 15, Article 17, Article 58, Article 60","1. The case involves SATS ASA as a data controller processing personal data of its members, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as outlined in Article 2, given that the company operates within the EU/EEA and processes personal data through automated means.

2. Data subject 1 submitted an access request on 29 August 2018, and the controller failed to respond, violating Article 12(3) GDPR, which requires the controller to provide information on action taken without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.

3. The controller's failure to respond to data subject 1's access request also constitutes a violation of Article 15 GDPR, which grants data subjects the right to obtain confirmation and access to their personal data, and the controller must comply without undue delay.

4. Data subject 2 submitted an access request on 25 February 2019, which the controller did not respond to, again violating Articles 12(3) and 15 GDPR for the same reasons as above.

5. Data subject 2 also submitted an erasure request on 25 February 2019, which the controller refused to comply with, violating Article 17 GDPR, as the data subject had terminated their membership, and the data was no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected (Article 17(1)(a)).

6. Data subject 3 submitted an erasure request on 5 October 2019 after terminating their membership, and the controller refused to comply, again violating Article 17 GDPR for the same reason as above.

7. Data subject 4 submitted an erasure request on 6 August 2021, which the controller refused to comply with, further violating Article 17 GDPR, indicating a pattern of non-compliance.

8. The controller argued that the violation of Articles 12(3) and 15 GDPR for data subject 1's request should not be penalized due to challenges in applying new rules shortly after GDPR became applicable. However, Article 5(2) (accountability principle) requires controllers to demonstrate compliance from the effective date, and Article 83(2)(b) considers the negligent character of the infringement, which is not excused by transitional challenges.

9. The controller's claim that penalizing both Article 12(3) and Article 15 violations violates the principle of ne bis in idem is unfounded, as these articles impose distinct obligations (procedural response duty and substantive access right), and penalties for separate infringements are permitted under Article 83(3).

10. The controller argued that the assessment of storage periods and legal bases is discretionary and should not be questioned by the DPA. However, Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation) and Article 6 (lawfulness of processing) require controllers to justify their decisions, and Article 58(1) grants supervisory authorities investigative powers to assess compliance, including the authority to question such assessments.

11. The controller transferred personal data to Facebook, located outside the EU/EEA, without a proper legal ground, violating Chapter V of the GDPR (Articles 44-49), which requires appropriate safeguards for transfers to third countries, such as an adequacy decision, binding corporate rules, or other mechanisms, none of which were indicated in the case.

12. The DPA's joint handling of the complaints is procedurally valid under Article 60 GDPR, as the complaints concern similar infringements, and the consistency mechanism was followed by submitting the draft decision to other supervisory authorities, which raised no objections.

13. The administrative fine of NOK 10,000,000 is justified under Article 83(2) and (5), considering the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringements (multiple violations over time), the number of data subjects affected, and the controller's negligent character in failing to comply with basic GDPR principles and rights.

14. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to violations of Articles 12(3), 15, 17, and Chapter V, among others, and the controller's failure to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2)."
"On 14 February 2019, the Luxembourg DPA decided to open an investigation into the companies of Group A and particularly into Company A, a bank institution (controller). The purpose of this investigation was to verify the compliance with the GDPR of the controller's video surveillance and company's cars geolocation systems.

Surveillance cameras

The investigation showed that surveillance cameras were indeed in place. Cameras’ fields of view included safe rooms, meeting rooms, the reception desk, the cash desk, offices, a computer room and a room where employees take breaks. The head of the investigation considered this to be permanent surveillance of employees at their workplace, which could create psychological pressure. He described the surveillance as “disproportionate to the purpose” and an “excessive intrusion into the employees’ private sphere”. He added that employees had no way of escaping the surveillance.

After receiving the minutes of this visit, the Company wrote a letter in which it explained that distinction should be made between two types of locations filmed, depending on their economic and strategic sensitivity: the counters and the safe room on one hand, and other locations on the other. It also considered that employees were not filmed permanently since they could avoid the cameras' field of vision. The company also argued that the presence of certain cameras was justified in relation to the purpose.

For example, a camera positioned in the safe where one of the employees was stationed and where the company kept precious metals and physical securities. The company stressed that the room is locked for security reasons and that the camera made it possible to see if the employee was ""feeling unwell"". The company also explained that this is an ad hoc workstation, subject to patrols, which means that the employee working there was not filmed at all times.

Another example was given by the cameras placed upon the counters. The company explained that employees were only filmed from behind and that their hands, faces, private or professional equipment were not targeted. According to the company, the presence of these cameras was therefore necessary and proportionate to the aims pursued.

Finally, with regard to the surveillance of the public highway, the investigation showed, among other things, that buildings not belonging to the company were filmed. The company argued that this was necessary to effectively protect their building. The head of the investigation however considered this surveillance to be disproportionate.

Information on surveillance cameras

The investigation showed that data subjects were informed about the use of surveillance cameras by a pictogram and an old CNPD authorisation sticker at the entrance door and at a passageway closed to the public. According to the head of the investigation, this information was incomplete because it did not provide, among other things, the following elements: the retention period, the purposes of the processing, the right to rectification and erasure. The GDPR intranet section did not contain sufficient information either.

In its letter in response to the minutes of the visit, the company explained that the pictograms were the first step of a various steps information which included the GDPR intranet section and mandatory trainings on data privacy. The company also reported that it had initiated the replacement of the pictograms and would indicate the missing information in the future.

With regard to third parties, the agents noted that a sign was installed containing a camera image and the words ""locals under video surveillance"".) The company considered that informing third parties was not an absolute obligation under Article 13 (which states that it is not required when communication is impossible or would require disproportionate effort).

Geo-location system on company's cars

The investigation did not demonstrate the existence of such geo-location systems.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13","1. The case involves Company A, a bank institution acting as a data controller, processing personal data through video surveillance systems as per the policy's definition of processing (Article 4(2)) and controller (Article 4(7)).

2. The investigation revealed that surveillance cameras were placed in areas including break rooms, offices, and meeting rooms, constituting processing of employee personal data. Under Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation principle), personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes. The head of investigation found this surveillance disproportionate and creating psychological pressure, indicating violation of this principle.

3. For processing to be lawful under Article 6(1), it must meet one of the specified conditions. The company's justification for surveillance in non-sensitive areas (like break rooms) likely fails the necessity test under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests), as less intrusive measures could achieve the same security purposes.

4. Regarding information provided to data subjects, Article 13 requires controllers to provide specific information including purposes of processing, retention periods, and data subject rights. The investigation found the pictograms and intranet information incomplete, missing key elements like retention periods and rights to rectification/erasure, constituting a violation of Article 13.

5. The company's argument that third-party information wasn't absolutely required under Article 13 is incorrect for individuals entering the premises, as they are directly subject to processing and must be informed under Article 13 unless the exceptions in Article 14(5) apply (which weren't demonstrated here).

6. The surveillance of public streets and other buildings not belonging to the company was found disproportionate, violating the purpose limitation principle in Article 5(1)(b) and potentially lacking a lawful basis under Article 6, as it extends beyond what is necessary for protecting the company's premises.

7. While the company provided some justifications for cameras in sensitive areas (safe room, counters), the investigation found the overall implementation disproportionate and excessively intrusive, particularly regarding continuous monitoring of employees in non-sensitive areas, violating the GDPR's fundamental principles in Article 5.

8. Therefore, based on violations of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), transparency requirements (Article 13), and likely lacking proper lawful basis for much of the processing (Article 6), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller is Company A which was acting as building manager of a residence co-ownership. The data subjects are  Mr A and Mr B, some of the co-owners.

On 11 February 2019, the controller sent two emails to the other co-owners. The communication contained, among other things, the following data: the accounting situation of Mr. A and Mr. B vis-à-vis the co-ownership and their private addresses. They were intended to highlight the payment irregularities concerning the two.

The data subjects informed the controller that the disclosure amounted to a data breach and encouraged him to report it within 72 hours. They also requested access to their data and information on the processing operations. The company responded more than a month after these letters, without providing the requested information.

The data subject filed a complaint. On 4 October 2019, the Luxembourg DPA opened an investigation.

In his defense, the controller explained that under applicable national law, as a building manager, it was the cashier and accountant of the co-ownership and, as such, under the co-owners' supervision. For the co-owner to do so, it was crucial to disclose the debtors details. He therefore considered that it had to comply with a legal obligation and that the processing was therefore lawful under Article 6(1)(c). The controller also invoked Article 6(1)(f), explaining that it had a legitimate interest to the processing because it would be liable if it did not recover the debts of the co-ownership.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves Company A as the controller processing personal data (accounting situations and private addresses) of Mr. A and Mr. B, who are data subjects under Article 4(1) of the policy.

2. The controller disclosed personal data to other co-owners via email without a valid legal basis. While the controller invoked Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation), the Luxembourg DPA found no specific national law requiring such disclosure of detailed personal data to all co-owners, violating Article 6(3) which requires that the legal basis be laid down by Union or Member State law.

3. The controller also invoked Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests), but failed to demonstrate that the disclosure of private addresses was necessary for debt recovery purposes. This violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) and the requirement under Article 6(1)(f) that the controller's interests must not override the data subjects' rights and freedoms.

4. The disclosure of private addresses was disproportionate to the purpose of debt recovery, as less intrusive means were available (e.g., disclosing only debt amounts without addresses), violating the principle of proportionality inherent in Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency).

5. The controller failed to respond to the data subjects' access requests within one month as required by Article 12(3), and did not provide the information specified in Article 15 regarding the processing operations.

6. The processing involved disclosing personal data to multiple recipients without appropriate safeguards, violating the controller's obligation under Article 5(1)(f) to ensure appropriate security of the data.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of Articles 5, 6, 12, and 15."
"The concerned controller was an optician and merchant for glasses, sunglasses as well as contact lenses. As part of its business, the controller sent out commercial messages through its newsletter service.

The concerned data subject was one of the newsletter's recipients. Although its is not directly stated in the case, it is strongly suggested that the controller processed the data subject's data based on legitimate interest. The data subject objected to the processing, as foreseen by Article 21 GDPR, by clicking the unsubscribe button in the newsletter. Yet, the controller continued to send commercial communication to the data subject's email address in a frequent manner. Consequently, the data subject sent a complaint to the Romanian DPA, prompting the DPA to investigate the matter. The investigation confirmed the data subject's assertions.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 21,"1. The case involves a controller (the optician) processing personal data (email addresses) for the purpose of sending commercial newsletters, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of ""processing"" and ""controller"").

2. The controller likely relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) as the legal basis for processing, as suggested by the commercial nature of the communications. However, when the data subject exercised their right to object under Article 21(1) by unsubscribing, the controller was required to cease processing unless they could demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override the data subject's interests.

3. Article 21(2) specifically states that where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to processing, and under Article 21(3), where such an objection is made, the personal data ""shall no longer be processed for such purposes.""

4. The controller continued sending commercial communications after the data subject's objection, thereby violating Article 21(3) by failing to immediately cease processing for direct marketing purposes.

5. This continuation also violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing no longer had a valid legal basis after the objection was raised.

6. Furthermore, the controller failed to comply with the data subject's right to object, which is a violation of Article 12(2), requiring controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.

7. The investigation by the Romanian DPA confirmed these violations, indicating a breach of the GDPR's provisions regarding the right to object and the principles of lawful processing.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"Virtue Integrated Elder Care Ltd (""VIEC""), the controller, operates and manages five nursing homes in Dublin, Ireland. On 15 August 2020, VIEC became aware through a report to their IT helpdesk that one of the users of their internal systems was being blocked from sending emails. The controller subsequently discovered that the email address of one of its managers had been subject to a phishing attack, and that emails had been rerouted to a third party Gmail account.

On 19 August 2019, VIEC notified the Irish DPA (the DPC) of a personal data breach. Based on initial analysis of the breach notification and subsequent documentation provided during the breach handling process, the DPC considered that the matter concerned a possible “breach of security potentially leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed” by VIEC. As a result, the DPC commenced an investigation.

In a commencement letter, the DPC informed VIEC that their inquiry would examine whether or not the company discharged its obligations in connection with the subject matter of the personal data breach and determine whether or not any provision(s) of data protection law had been violated by VIEC in that context.

The scope of the inquiry was stated to include the following. Firstly, the steps taken by VIEC to comply with the principle of integrity and confidentiality pursuant to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. Secondly, the technical and organisational measures taken to ensure security of processing pursuant to Article 32(1) GDPR. Thirdly, the ability of the controller to demonstrate ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability of personal data pursuant to Article 32(1)(b) GDPR. Fourth, the process employed by VIEC for regularly testing the effectiveness of measures for ensuring appropriate security pursuant to Article 32(1)(d) GDPR. Fifth, and finally, the ability of VIEC to demonstrate that it had assessed the risk to processing special category information.

As part of the investigation the security provider for VIEC, ‘Ortus’, conducted a report which determined that the most likely root cause of the breach was that the credentials of a user account at one of the nursing homes were captured on a fake website. The link to that fake website was likely received in a phishing email. The original email that delivered the malicious link in question was not identified by the security provider. The email account was thereby accessed by an unauthorised third party, using the captured credentials. This resulted in unauthorised access to stored emails, and allowed the bad actor to set up email forwarding of all inbound emails to a third party email account. In addition, this issue had been ongoing since 18 July 2020.

The DPC prepared an Inquiry Issues Paper to document the relevant facts of the case, and invited submissions from VIEC, in particular regarding any inaccuracies and/or incomplete facts. Outlining the mitigating factors to be considered, VIEC explained that the assigned DPO was aware of the requirement to report the breach within 72 hours and that this timeline had become exhausted by the time the DPO became aware of the breach. The DPO hastily notified the DPC of the breach and supplemented this notification with additional information. The DPC noted this is an example of good practice on the part of a controller in this regard. In another proposed mitigating factor, VIEC submitted that password for the affected account was reset and a forced logout was performed.

The controller also confirmed, among other things, that 213 data subjects had their personal data compromised, and that 129 of these residents had special category data compromised; 117 of these individuals had health data compromised and 12 had biometric data compromised.

On 11 November 2022 the DPC provided a draft decision to VIEC, and the controller was invited to make further submissions on the proposed infringements. In its response to the draft decision, VIEC asserted that it considered the proposals too excessive, and made a range of submissions in support of their position. VIEC stressed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on its ability to implement data security provisions. In particular, they explained that senior managers were redirected to frontline roles, at a time of increased regularity of phishing attacks.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves Virtue Integrated Elder Care Ltd (VIEC) as a data controller processing personal data of nursing home residents, including special category health and biometric data, which falls under the scope of GDPR regulation (Article 2, Material Scope).

2. VIEC experienced a personal data breach where an unauthorized third party gained access to a manager's email account through phishing, resulting in unauthorized access to emails and forwarding of inbound emails to a third-party account from 18 July to 15 August 2020 (Article 4(12), defining personal data breach).

3. VIEC failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), given the sensitive nature of the processed data (special categories under Article 9) and the duration of the breach (one month).

4. Specifically, VIEC did not implement multi-factor authentication for email accounts containing sensitive personal data, which would have constituted an appropriate technical measure under Article 32(1) to prevent unauthorized access.

5. VIEC failed to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of processing systems under Article 32(1)(b), as evidenced by the prolonged unauthorized access and email forwarding without detection.

6. The controller did not implement a process for regularly testing the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures under Article 32(1)(d), as the breach went undetected for approximately one month despite security systems being in place.

7. VIEC did not properly assess the risks to rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing of special category data (health and biometric data) under Article 32(1), as required by the principle of integrity and confidentiality in Article 5(1)(f).

8. While VIEC cited COVID-19 pandemic challenges as mitigating factors, the GDPR does not provide exemptions for emergency situations regarding implementation of appropriate security measures under Article 32.

9. The breach affected 213 data subjects, including 129 with compromised special category data (117 health data, 12 biometric data), demonstrating the high-risk nature of the processing activities and the insufficient safeguards implemented.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy, specifically with Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1), 32(1)(b), and 32(1)(d)."
"In this case the controller 'An Garda Síochána', a branch of the Irish national police service, displayed the details of an ongoing investigation on a bulletin board in one of their police stations. This information included a list containing the names and address of 108 data subjects, including vulnerable subjects and persons of interests in ongoing investigations. No individual, other than a police guard, should have had unaccompanied access to the room. A contractor who was undertaking repair works at the An Garda Síochána station entered the room unaccompanied. The list, containing the personal data, was ultimately shared on social media.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 6","1. The case involves An Garda Síochána as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means or as part of a filing system.

2. The personal data displayed included names and addresses of 108 data subjects, including vulnerable subjects and persons of interest in ongoing investigations. This constitutes processing of regular personal data under Article 4(1), and may include special categories of data under Article 9 if any data revealed racial origin, political opinions, or other sensitive information, though this isn't explicitly stated.

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). The display of sensitive personal data on a bulletin board in an area accessible to contractors represents inadequate security measures.

4. The controller did not maintain confidentiality of processing as required by Article 29, as persons acting under the authority of the controller (the contractor) were able to access personal data without proper authorization or supervision.

5. The incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as there was unauthorized disclosure of personal data when the contractor accessed and subsequently shared the information on social media.

6. The controller likely failed to comply with the data protection by design and by default requirements under Article 25, as appropriate measures were not implemented to ensure that, by default, personal data were not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.

7. The breach involved a likely high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, particularly vulnerable individuals and persons of interest in investigations, yet there is no indication that the controller communicated this breach to data subjects as required under Article 34.

8. The controller bears responsibility for this breach under the accountability principle in Article 5(2), as they were unable to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR's security requirements.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The Italian DPA launched an investigation into the insurance broker Assiteca Spa (Assiteca), the controller, as part of the authorities planned inspection activities for 2022, and following a number of complaints. The investigation consisted of carrying out a simulated request for car insurance quotations on two websites operated by the company.

As a preliminary point, the company explained that the services on these two websites were previously implemented by 6Sicuro SpA, a company which merged into Assiteca in July 2021. At the time of the investigation, the two websites had separate IT systems and were undergoing re-engineering.

During the investigation process, the DPA raised several issues regarding the following: first, absence of consent to processing for promotional purposes; second, lack of transparency regarding data processing; third, the retention time of personal data; and fourth, the lack of technical and organisational measures to prevent prejudice to data subjects.

In its defence, the company emphasised that, as a result of the merger, the anomalies detected during the inspection by the Garante were to be considered as “circumscribed effects attributable to the misalignment of the systems and not to a systematic lack of security measures”. In addition, they have, started the process for the acquisition of a new system, and made changes to rectify any technical anomalies at issue here.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves Assiteca Spa as the data controller, which falls under the definition of a controller per Article 4 of the policy, making it subject to GDPR regulations.

2. The Italian DPA found that Assiteca processed personal data for promotional purposes without obtaining proper consent. Under Article 6(1)(a), processing requires the data subject's consent for specific purposes, and Article 7 specifies that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The absence of valid consent for promotional processing constitutes a violation.

3. The investigation revealed a lack of transparency regarding data processing. Articles 12, 13, and 14 require controllers to provide clear and comprehensive information to data subjects about processing activities, including purposes, legal basis, and retention periods. Assiteca's failure to meet these transparency obligations violates these provisions.

4. The DPA identified issues with the retention time of personal data. Article 5(1)(e) stipulates that personal data must be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary. Assiteca's failure to adhere to appropriate retention periods breaches this principle.

5. The case also involved a lack of technical and organisational measures to protect data subjects. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Assiteca's deficiencies in this area, even if attributed to system misalignment following a merger, do not excuse non-compliance with these obligations.

6. The company's defense regarding system misalignment due to merger does not absolve it of responsibility under GDPR. Article 24 emphasizes that the controller is responsible for ensuring and demonstrating compliance regardless of internal organizational changes or system integrations.

7. Therefore, the case demonstrates multiple violations of GDPR provisions including those related to lawful basis for processing (Articles 6-7), transparency (Articles 12-14), data minimization and storage limitation (Article 5), and security measures (Article 32).

8. Consequently, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Szczecin District Court (the controller) stored personal data, among others, on portable USB memory sticks. In 2020, an employee lost three of these USB sticks (one encrypted and two private unencrypted ones) containing draft rulings and personal data of an unidentified number of data subjects, collected during the years 2004-2020. Upon receiving information about this incident, the controller reported the data breach to the Polish DPA who started an ex officio investigation.

The DPA requested information regarding the organisational and technical measures adopted to prevent security breaches. The controller submitted that it had carried out a risk analysis in its data protection impact assessment (DPIA) in which it had rated the loss of personal data as a medium level risk and had introduced the obligation to encrypt any personal data stored on portable media. Moreover, the controller allegedly carried out regular data security training for its staff and performed bi-yearly testing of staff equipment.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves the Szczecin District Court as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1), as it involves processing by automated means (storage on USB sticks) and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller stored personal data on portable USB memory sticks, some of which were unencrypted. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including specifically ""the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data"" where appropriate.

3. The loss of three USB sticks (one encrypted and two unencrypted) containing personal data collected over 16 years (2004-2020) constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it involves the accidental destruction, loss, or alteration of personal data.

4. While the controller had conducted a DPIA and rated the loss of personal data as a medium-level risk, the actual incident demonstrates that the implemented measures were insufficient. Article 35(7) requires that a DPIA contain ""an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects"" and ""the measures envisaged to address the risks."" The occurrence of this breach indicates the risk assessment was inadequate and the measures implemented were not sufficient to prevent the breach.

5. Article 5(1)(f) establishes the principle of ""integrity and confidentiality,"" requiring that personal data be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage."" The loss of unencrypted USB sticks containing personal data directly violates this fundamental principle.

6. The controller's claim of having encryption policies and regular training (Article 32(4)) is undermined by the fact that two of the lost USB sticks were unencrypted, indicating a failure in the implementation of these technical and organisational measures.

7. While the controller reported the breach to the supervisory authority (consistent with Article 33(1)), this does not remedy the underlying failure to implement appropriate security measures to prevent the breach from occurring in the first place.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to violations of Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle), Article 32(1) (security of processing), and inadequate implementation of measures identified in the DPIA as required by Article 35."
"Following the Schrems II ruling of 16 July 2020 (CJEU case C-311/18) the European Center for Digital Rights (noyb) lodged 101 complaints to several data protection authorities in the European Economic Area (EEA). All complaints concerned the use of Google Analytics or Facebook Connect on websites in the EEA.

In accordance with Article 80(1) GDPR, noyb lodged a complaint on 17 August 2020 with the Austrian DPA against Telenor ASA (the controller) for their use of Google Analytics on their website and alleged transfer of a data subject's personal data to the US in violation of Article 44 GDPR. The data subject provided the DPA with a HTTP Archive format (HAR) data of the website, i.e., a JSON-formatted archive file format for logging a web browser’s interaction with a website, as proof of US-transfers being made.

As per Article 4(16)(a) GDPR, Telenor’s main establishment is in Norway. Consequently, the Austrian DPA transferred the complaint to the Norwegian DPA in accordance with Article 56(1), who proceeded to investigate the case.

The controller informed the DPA that they in late August 2020 initiated a review project to assess relevant agreements in light of the Schrems II ruling. They found this to apply to their use of Google Analytics since the agreement was with Google as a US processor of their. With the Privacy Shield now invalidated, the controller entered into standard contractual clauses (SCCs) Module Two with Google on 12 August 2020 for data transfers to the US.

However, the controller did not carry out a thorough review of potential third country legislation (a ""transfer impact assessment""), as it, according to information from Google, was not possible to determine the exact location of processing. The decision, however, refers to a statement by Google informing that Google Analytics data is stored in the US.

The parties still agreed supplementary measures. First, Google has established policies and procedures and a team of qualified lawyers for handling authority requests for user data. Second, Google offers and the controller implemented the Anonymize IP feature and, finally, the controller had applied a redaction script on the website to prevent personal data unintentionally being shared with Google.

Google Analytics was implemented on the website until 15 January 2021 and collected, until then, online identifiers, including cookie identifiers, IP addresses, device identifiers and client identifiers. The controller had enabled the IP anonymization feature and therefore argued that the identifiers listed above could not be regarded as personal data as this feature had ""severed any link to an invididual"". Google had also informed them that it would not be possible to extract such data following a potential legally binding authority request. In conclusion, the controller thus argued that the only personal data collected by Google Analytics and subsequently processed by them were IP addresses.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 44, Article 46, Article 56, Article 58, Article 60, Article 80","1. The case involves the transfer of personal data to the United States (a third country) through the use of Google Analytics, which falls under the scope of Chapter V of the GDPR regarding transfers of personal data to third countries (Article 44).

2. The controller (Telenor ASA) relied on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with Google as the legal mechanism for data transfers to the US (Article 46(2)(c)), but failed to conduct a thorough transfer impact assessment to evaluate whether US surveillance laws would undermine the protection afforded by the SCCs, as required by the Schrems II ruling and Article 46(1), which mandates that transfers subject to appropriate safeguards must ensure ""enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies.""

3. The controller's argument that IP anonymization rendered the data non-personal is contradicted by Google's own information that data is stored in the US and by the nature of the identifiers collected (cookie identifiers, device identifiers, client identifiers), which constitute personal data under Article 4(1) as they relate to an identifiable natural person.

4. The supplementary measures implemented (Google's internal policies, IP anonymization, and redaction scripts) were insufficient to address the fundamental conflict with US surveillance laws, as confirmed by the European Data Protection Board's recommendations following Schrems II, which state that technical measures must effectively prevent US authorities from accessing personal data.

5. The transfer therefore violated Article 44's general principle that transfers to third countries must not undermine the level of protection guaranteed by the GDPR, as the US lacks an adequacy decision (Article 45) and the controller failed to provide adequate supplementary measures to compensate for the lack of data protection in the US legal system.

6. The controller also violated Article 24(1) by failing to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the Regulation, specifically by not properly assessing the risks of US surveillance laws despite the Schrems II ruling.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Two companies: Finopro IFN and Integral Collection were victims of ransomware attacks. This implied that data they possessed (from ID cards, phone numbers, account statements...) were accessed without authorization and their security was compromised. The companies notified the breaches to the DPA, which then opened two investigations.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 83","1. The case involves two companies, Finopro IFN and Integral Collection, which experienced ransomware attacks leading to unauthorized access and compromise of personal data including ID cards, phone numbers, and account statements, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) of the GDPR.

2. Under Article 33(1) of the GDPR, the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The companies fulfilled this obligation by notifying the DPA, which is compliant with this article.

3. However, Article 34(1) requires that when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The compromised data (ID cards, phone numbers, account statements) are sensitive and could lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or other harms, indicating a high risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

4. The case does not mention any communication of the breach to the affected data subjects by the companies. Therefore, there is a violation of Article 34(1), as the controller must inform data subjects of the breach when it is likely to result in a high risk.

5. The exceptions under Article 34(3) do not appear to apply: (a) the companies did not implement appropriate technical measures like encryption to render the data unintelligible; (b) there is no indication that subsequent measures ensured the high risk is no longer likely to materialize; and (c) communication would not involve disproportionate effort, as contact details like phone numbers were compromised, making direct communication feasible.

6. Additionally, under Article 32(1), controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The occurrence of a ransomware attack suggests possible insufficient security measures, potentially violating Article 32, though the primary noncompliance stems from the failure to communicate the breach to data subjects.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to the failure to communicate the personal data breach to data subjects as required under Article 34(1)."
"This case concerns A&G Couriers, a company providing courier services, (the “Controller”) which engaged a third party IT software contractor (“Contractor”) to undertake a ""Brexit project"". This project was aimed at providing the UK tax authority (Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs – HMRC) with access to their internal reporting system to facilitate declarations of duty and VAT.

The Contractor immediately began facilitating access to the reports for external review and, while these changes to the system were being made, the server which housed all the data became exposed to the public internet. It was suggested by the Controller that – due to insufficient checks on security patches, user restrictions and access controls by the Contractor – the configuration of the affected server was implemented incorrectly, and the IP address of the affected server was inadvertently.

For a total of two days, the servers, which housed in total, the unencrypted personal data of 446,143 data subjects, were publicly available. This included their names, home addresses, email addresses and mobile numbers. The Controller further clarified that each of these categories of personal data may not be fully present in each record affected by the personal data breach, since the data collected is client specific and not all fields are mandatory.

In addition, an unknown individual gained access to the exposed server and exfiltrated the personal information pertaining to a large number of data subjects. The hacker was able to access the records of 10,000 data subjects in total.

In submissions to the DPC, the Controller outlined their account of the incident and made a number of arguments in its defence. Firstly, the Controller asserted that, depending on the specific data, it was in some cases a controller, and in others a processor, and so the duty to implement appropriate measures was not placed upon them in all circumstances.

Secondly, the controller stated that the servers contained some or all of the following categories of personal data: names, home addresses, email addresses and mobile numbers (as dependent on client requirements). The Controller submitted that, in an objective assessment, the risks posed by the Controller’s processing at the time of the personal data breach involved low to moderate risks, both in likelihood and severity, to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. It is admitted that there was a significant quantity of personal data related to a large number of data subjects processed and stored for a period of thirty days by the Controller, however, this personal data may be considered at the lower end of the scale in terms of sensitivity.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves A&G Couriers as a data controller under Article 4 of the GDPR, as they determine the purposes and means of processing personal data through their courier services, regardless of their claim that they sometimes acted as a processor.

2. The controller engaged a third-party contractor (processor) for IT services, which under Article 28 requires the controller to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure protection of data subjects' rights.

3. The server containing unencrypted personal data of 446,143 data subjects became publicly accessible for two days due to incorrect configuration by the contractor, constituting a personal data breach under Article 4(12).

4. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. The lack of proper security patches, user restrictions, and access controls represents a failure to implement such measures.

5. The controller argued they were not always the controller and that the data posed ""low to moderate risks,"" but under Article 24, the controller remains responsible for compliance regardless of their role in specific processing activities, and must implement measures considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

6. The breach involved sensitive personal data including names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of a large number of data subjects, creating significant risks to their rights and freedoms contrary to the controller's assessment, particularly regarding potential misuse of contact information and personal details.

7. Article 33 requires controllers to notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware, which the controller did, but the breach itself resulted from failure to meet their obligations under Articles 24, 28, and 32.

8. The controller's attempt to deflect responsibility to the contractor does not absolve them of their obligations under Article 28(1) to ensure processors provide sufficient guarantees and implement appropriate measures, and under Article 28(4) where the processor's actions make the controller liable.

9. The scale of the breach (446,143 data subjects with 10,000 records exfiltrated) and the nature of the data (including contact information that could be used for phishing or harassment) demonstrate a failure to implement data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Rovigo Hospital, the data controller, stored the data subject's medical records in another patient's folder and inadvertently disclosed their health data to the latter. Upon becoming aware of this, the data controller asked the third party to return the documents and adopted technical and organisational measures to prevent similar data breaches. The controller notified the DPA and the DPA opened an investigation. There was no dispute as to the facts.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 32","1. The case involves Rovigo Hospital as a data controller processing health data, which qualifies as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller stored the data subject's medical records in another patient's folder, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of health data to a third party. This constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it involved unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The inadvertent mixing of patient records demonstrates a failure to implement adequate organizational measures to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

4. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, particularly for special categories of data. The fact that health records were stored in the wrong patient's folder indicates insufficient safeguards were in place to prevent such errors.

5. While the controller took remedial actions after the breach (requesting return of documents and implementing preventive measures), these actions occurred after the violation had already taken place and do not rectify the initial compliance failure.

6. The breach involved health data, which receives special protection under Article 9, and the disclosure was not based on any of the lawful exceptions listed in Article 9(2), particularly since the disclosure was accidental rather than intentional or necessary for any permitted purpose.

7. The case is therefore NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to the controller's failure to implement adequate organizational measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of special category data, in violation of Articles 5(1)(f), 9, and 32."
"This case concerns the Friuli Centrale University Health Authority, the controller, which (upon instruction from the Friuli Venezia Giulia Regional Council) instructed GPs to validate a list of patients compiled for the supposed purpose of “statistical stratification”. These patients, the data subjects, had been previously identified by the Health Authority, according to its own (unknown) criteria, as being in complex and comorbid conditions and therefore at a high risk of major complications from covid-19 infections. The personal information processed included details of therapies, pathological status, family addresses, living conditions/habits and the procedure for collecting this information imposed upon GPs a disclosure of their patient’s health data without the chance to check if consent had been obtained.

The Italian DPA commenced a preliminary investigation in which they requested specific information from the controller concerning: the initiatives taken to ensure the data was processed lawfully; the purpose of the processing; the methods for obtaining informed consent; a description of whether the data was special category health data or anonymised data; and the impact assessment carried out.

The controller responded to the request by stating, firstly, that the activity is based on a legal provision related to the current state of emergency. Secondly, the three lawful bases for processing (depending on the type of data) are: Article 9(2)(h) GDPR (necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine); Article 9(2)(i) GDPR (for reasons of public interest in the area of public health); and Article 9(2)(g) GDPR (for reasons of substantial public interest). Thirdly, the use of an algorithm was only applied to the data of those who had consented to extraction for this purpose. Finally, that they did not deem it necessary to carry out an impact assessment, as they did not perceive a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In further submissions to the investigation, the controller confirmed that the number of data subjects affected by the activities described was more than 40,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 13, Article 14, Article 35, Article 58, Article 82","1. The case involves the processing of special category health data (including details of therapies, pathological status, and living conditions) by the Friuli Centrale University Health Authority, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) GDPR.

2. The processing of special category health data under Article 9(1) GDPR requires one of the specific lawful bases under Article 9(2). The controller cited Article 9(2)(h), (i), and (g) as bases, but failed to demonstrate compliance with the specific conditions attached to these provisions:
   - For Article 9(2)(h), processing must be carried out by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to professional secrecy obligations, which was not properly ensured when instructing GPs to disclose data without consent verification.
   - For Article 9(2)(i), processing must be based on Union or Member State law providing suitable safeguards, which the controller did not adequately identify or demonstrate.
   - For Article 9(2)(g), processing must be based on Union or Member State law that is proportionate and provides specific safeguards, which was not substantiated.

3. The controller processed data of over 40,000 data subjects without conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as required under Article 35(1) and (3)(a) GDPR, as the processing involved large-scale systematic monitoring of special category data and was likely to result in high risk to rights and freedoms.

4. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects about the processing activities as required under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, particularly regarding the purposes, legal bases, and data subject rights.

5. The processing activities involved instructing GPs to disclose health data without proper verification of consent or other lawful bases, violating the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR.

6. The controller's claim that an algorithm was only applied to consented data does not rectify the initial unlawful collection and processing of special category data without a proper legal basis.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"This case involves an own-volition investigation conducted by the Irish DPA (DPC) into Kildare County Council, the controller. In June 2018, Officers from the Special Investigations Unit of the DPC were authorised to conduct a range of inquiries pertaining to surveillance technologies deployed by state authorities, including An Garda Síochána (the national police) and various local authorities, including Kildare County Council. These inquiries sought to determine whether the data processing was lawful, and also to ensure that full accountability measures for the collection and processing of personal data were in place, in advance of further investment in and deployment of newer surveillance technology.

The investigation into Kildare County Council focused on the following: the legal basis for surveillance technology employed for the purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting crime; the legal basis for surveillance tech deployed for purposes other than preventing, investigating, detecting, or prosecuting crime; appropriate signage and general transparency; and the question of a joint controller agreement between the council and the national police. Furthermore, the authority sought to examine the security measures for traffic management CCTV; housing department CCTV; and the transmission of CCTV footage to An Garda Síochána.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 26, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves an investigation into Kildare County Council's use of surveillance technologies, which process personal data, making the council a data controller subject to GDPR regulations as defined in Article 4(7).

2. The processing of personal data related to criminal offenses (e.g., surveillance for crime prevention) falls under Article 10, which requires such processing to be carried out only under official authority or when authorized by Union/Member State law with appropriate safeguards. The investigation found the council lacked a proper legal basis for this processing, violating Article 10.

3. For surveillance purposes not related to crime prevention (e.g., traffic management), the council must have a lawful basis under Article 6(1), such as consent, legitimate interests, or public interest. The investigation revealed insufficient documentation and justification for these processing activities, violating the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6.

4. The council failed to provide appropriate signage and transparency measures, violating Article 12 (transparent communication) and Article 13/14 (obligation to provide information to data subjects), as individuals were not adequately informed about the processing of their personal data.

5. The transmission of CCTV footage to An Garda Síochána (national police) without a clear joint controller agreement violates Article 26, which requires transparent arrangements between joint controllers to define their respective responsibilities for GDPR compliance.

6. The investigation identified inadequate security measures for CCTV systems and data transmission, violating Article 32, which requires appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

7. The council's failure to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for high-risk processing activities (e.g., systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas) violates Article 35, which mandates a DPIA where processing is likely to result in high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.

8. Overall, the council's processing activities lacked accountability under Article 5(2), as they could not demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, including lawfulness, transparency, and security.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A Romanian political party (Alianța pentru Unirea Românilor) had a membership form on its website. When a person filled in the form and signed it, their data was collected (name, address, phone number, ID card number...). One person reported this to the Romanian DPA, which opened an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves a political party in Romania (Alianța pentru Unirea Românilor) acting as a data controller by collecting personal data through a membership form on its website, including sensitive information such as an ID card number, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of 'personal data' and 'controller').

2. The processing of personal data related to political opinions is considered a special category of data under Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The political party's processing of membership data inherently reveals political opinions, making it subject to this stricter regime.

3. For the processing to be lawful, the controller must rely on one of the conditions in Article 9(2). The most relevant condition for a political party would likely be explicit consent pursuant to Article 9(2)(a). However, the case does not indicate that the data subject provided explicit consent for processing this special category data, nor does it suggest any other applicable condition from Article 9(2) (e.g., processing carried out by a not-for-profit body with political aims under Article 9(2)(d), which would require that the data are not disclosed outside that body without consent).

4. Furthermore, for any processing to be lawful, it must have a valid basis under Article 6(1). While consent under Article 6(1)(a) could be a basis for general processing, the case does not provide details on whether the consent was freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous as required by Article 4(11) and Article 7. The context of a political party seeking membership may imply a power imbalance, potentially affecting the validity of consent.

5. The controller also has obligations to provide transparent information to the data subject at the time of data collection, as stipulated in Article 13. This includes, among other things, the identity of the controller, the purposes of processing, the legal basis, and the existence of the data subject's rights. The case does not indicate whether this information was provided, suggesting a potential violation of transparency principles.

6. The collection of an ID card number, a national identifier, is subject to additional safeguards under Article 87. Member States may determine specific conditions for processing such identifiers, and the controller must implement appropriate safeguards. The case does not demonstrate that such safeguards were in place.

7. Given that the processing involves special category data without a clear lawful basis under Article 9(2), and considering the lack of information regarding compliance with transparency requirements (Article 13) and appropriate safeguards for national identifiers (Article 87), the processing operation is not compliant with the GDPR.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The political party Partidul Uniunea Salvați România (Controller) reported to the DPA that as a result of a cyber-attack, the data it stored on an application server had been lost. The data included surnames, first names, email addresses, telephone numbers and political affiliation data.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a political party (Partidul Uniunea Salvați România) acting as a data controller, which lost personal data including surnames, first names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and political affiliation data due to a cyber-attack, as reported to the DPA (Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'personal data').

2. The lost data includes political affiliation data, which constitutes special category personal data under Article 9(1) as it reveals political opinions, requiring enhanced protection measures under the Regulation.

3. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access to personal data. The occurrence of a successful cyber-attack indicates insufficient security measures were implemented.

4. Article 33 requires controllers to notify personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay and within 72 hours where feasible. While the controller reported the breach to the DPA, the case does not specify whether this was done within the required timeframe, suggesting potential non-compliance with notification requirements.

5. Article 34 requires communication of the breach to data subjects when it is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The breach involved sensitive political opinion data, which inherently creates a high risk of discrimination, identity theft, and other harms to data subjects, yet there is no indication that affected individuals were notified.

6. The processing of political opinion data under Article 9 generally requires explicit consent or other specific legal bases under Article 9(2). The case does not demonstrate that appropriate lawful bases or additional safeguards were implemented for this special category data.

7. Article 5(1)(f) requires personal data to be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access, which was not maintained given the successful cyber-attack.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to failures in implementing appropriate security measures, potentially delayed breach notification to authorities, failure to notify data subjects of a high-risk breach, and insufficient protections for special category data."
"Commify Italia s.r.l. (controller) offers to business customers the service available at the Skebby platform (www.skebby.it) by which text messages can be sent via a web application or through application programming interfaces.

The Italian DPA carried out inspection activities at the controller place of business on several occasions: in 2018 as a result of a data breach notified by a client of the controller. In 2019 as a result of additional documentation provided by the controller and a complaint from which it emerged the potential unlawful storage of the content of text messages sent through the platform. Precisely with regard to the lawfulness of the procedures adopted regarding the storage of the content of text messages sent, in 2021 the DPO of a client company requested the intervention of the Italian DPA. As a result, the Italian DPA carried out a further inspection to verify the functioning of the platform.

The inspection revealed that:

•	The controller stored in its systems the content of messages sent by its customers, which also included special categories of personal data (such as, reservations for health services, messages sent by political parties to their members). The controller justified this retention on the grounds that the content of the messages was to be considered traffic data in accordance with Article 121(1-bis)(h) of Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003 (the Italian Data Protection Code) with the consequent obligation to retain them pursuant to Articles 123 and 132 of the Code.

•	With regard to the technical and organisational measures taken by the controller, it appeared that the traffic data (including the content of text messages) were stored in the controller's systems without any physical or logical distinction according to the purpose of retention (e.g. crime prevention and prosecution, billing, making the text available to the customer for consultation). Consequently, there was also no differentiation of retention periods according to each purpose. Access to these systems was possible for authorised personnel by means of one-factor authentication (e.g. username and password). The controller had not adopted any system for keeping track of the operations performed on the systems by persons acting under its authority. Finally, the transmission of data between the computer systems of some customers and the controller took place using insecure communication protocols (http), thus exposing the transmitted data to risks of unlawful acquisition or manipulation.

•	The controller performed automated checks on the content of messages sent by its customers in order to prevent fraudulent use of the service. To this end, it used preventive analysis systems by means of detection algorithms (URL, domain, keywords), blocking the sending of messages if potential fraudulent content was detected in the alias (alphanumeric string that identifies the sender instead of the telephone number), or in the text (e.g. in the case of links not expressly requested by the customer or for which the customer was not authorised, as well as in the presence of prohibited keywords).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves Commify Italia s.r.l. as a data controller processing personal data through its Skebby platform, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller stored the content of text messages, which included special categories of personal data (e.g., health service reservations, political party messages), without a valid legal basis under Article 9(1). Processing of special categories of data is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller's justification based on Italian legislation regarding traffic data retention does not automatically constitute a valid exception under Article 9(2), especially without demonstrating that the processing meets the requirements of necessity and proportionality under Union or Member State law that provides suitable safeguards (Article 9(2)(g) or (j)).

3. The controller failed to implement data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25. Specifically, they stored traffic data (including message content) without physical or logical distinction based on the purpose of retention (e.g., crime prevention, billing, customer consultation), and without differentiated retention periods. This violates the principles of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)) and storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), as data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary.

4. The controller did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as mandated by Article 32. The use of one-factor authentication (e.g., username and password) for system access is insufficient, especially given the sensitive nature of the data processed. Additionally, the lack of a system to track operations performed by authorised personnel violates the requirement to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems (Article 32(1)(b)).

5. The transmission of data between customers and the controller using insecure communication protocols (HTTP) exposed personal data to risks of unlawful access or manipulation, failing to implement measures to ensure the security of processing, including protection against unauthorised disclosure or access, as required by Article 32(1)(a) and (b).

6. The controller performed automated checks on message content using algorithms to prevent fraudulent use, which may involve automated decision-making including profiling under Article 22(1). The GDPR requires that data subjects have the right not to be subject to such decisions unless they meet specific conditions (e.g., explicit consent, necessity for contract, or authorised by Union/Member State law). The controller did not demonstrate that suitable safeguards were in place, such as the right to obtain human intervention, to express one's point of view, or to contest the decision, as stipulated in Article 22(2) and (3).

7. The controller's retention of message content without differentiation by purpose and without adhering to the principle of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c)) further exacerbates the noncompliance, as it involves processing more data than necessary for the specified purposes.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5 (principles of processing), 9 (processing of special categories of data), 22 (automated decision-making), 25 (data protection by design and by default), and 32 (security of processing)."
"A data subject made an objection request to marketing communications received from a fashion retailer (the controller). The controller indicated that it would comply with the request, but continued sending marketing communications to the data subject.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA which started an investigation on that matter.

The investigation revealed that, in order to exercise their right, the data subject had to submit a written, dated and signed request. Moreover, it revealed that the information notice did not cover the information on data recipients, retention terms or the right to lodge a complaint to the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 13","1. The data subject exercised their right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes under Article 21(2) of the GDPR, which grants data subjects the right to object at any time to such processing.

2. The controller failed to cease processing for marketing purposes after the objection, violating Article 21(3), which explicitly states that upon objection, personal data shall no longer be processed for direct marketing.

3. The controller required the data subject to submit a written, dated, and signed request to exercise the right to object, which does not facilitate the exercise of data subject rights as mandated by Article 12(2), which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of rights under Articles 15-22.

4. The controller's information notice did not include information on data recipients (violating Article 13(1)(e)), retention periods (violating Article 13(2)(a)), or the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (violating Article 13(2)(d)), as required when personal data is collected from the data subject.

5. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Padua University Hospital notified the Italian DPA of a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR. The hospital accidentally sent to all the patients involved in a clinical trial an email in which the patients' email addresses were not put in BCC (blind carbon copy) but in CC (carbon copy), unintentionally making known the email addresses of all patients waiting for heart transplant.

In order to remedy the violation and reduce its negative effects on the people involved, instructions were given to inform each individual concerned about the mistake, urging them delete the email previously sent and not to use the email addresses of other recipients.

The Italian DPA investigated whether the processing of personal data of the email recipients was in violation of the basic principles set out in Article 5 GDPR.

The hospital argued that the seriousness of the potential impact for the interested parties was average, considering that the health data - the existence of a scheduled heart transplant - were isolated and common to all the interested parties and not accompanied by any other sensitive data. Furthermore, out of 19 email addresses only 7 were recognizable, while the other 12 were not immediately traceable to the account holder. The hospital further argued that the violation was partly due to the COVID – 19 pandemic and the shortage of staff. Finally, the hospital stated that the author of the violation certainly did not benefit from the violation and no complaints were received from the data subjects following breach notification to the data subjects.

The hospital also provided for the technical and organizational measures to be carried out in order to prevent data breaches in the future. These included staff training on the use of telematic tools in in the communication with patients.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 33, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves the Padua University Hospital, which is a data controller under GDPR, processing personal data of patients in a clinical trial for heart transplant, as per the definition of controller in Article 4(7).

2. The hospital disclosed patients' email addresses to other recipients by using CC instead of BCC in an email, which constitutes unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Email addresses are personal data under Article 4(1) as they relate to identifiable natural persons.

3. Article 5(1)(f) GDPR requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The failure to use BCC, a basic security measure for mass emails, violates this principle by allowing accidental disclosure.

4. Article 32 GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The hospital did not have adequate measures in place to prevent such a breach, as the use of CC instead of BCC indicates a lack of proper procedures or training.

5. The hospital argued that the impact was average and that only some email addresses were recognizable, but the GDPR principles are strict, and any unauthorized disclosure is a violation regardless of the perceived severity or recognizability, as per the accountability principle in Article 5(2).

6. The hospital cited COVID-19 and staff shortages as contributing factors, but GDPR does not provide exemptions for such circumstances; controllers must ensure continuous compliance and are responsible for implementing measures to mitigate risks, as outlined in Article 24.

7. While the hospital notified the supervisory authority under Article 33 and communicated the breach to data subjects under Article 34, these actions are remedial and do not absolve the hospital from the initial violation of Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32.

8. The breach involved data related to health (heart transplant patients), which is a special category under Article 9, but even without considering the health context, the disclosure of email addresses alone violates GDPR principles.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Between 21 May and 14 June 2021, Argon Medical Devices, Inc. (the controller) experienced a cyber security incident. It was discovered on 14 June 2021 when the controller's US Senior Vice President of Human Resources noticed missing emails in his inbox.

Upon further investigation, the controller determined that it had been subject to a business email compromise, perpetrated through an internal platform by an unauthorized third party, most likely through a phishing email. Consequently, the Director of Global IT Security put in place several cyber security measures, which appear to have contained the incident on 14 June 2021.

On 15 June 2021, they reported the incident to the local FBI Cybercrime Unit in the US and commenced an internal investigation to determine the extent and nature of the incident.

On 19 July 2021 they realized that personal data such as salary and benefits of all of their (20) European employees, including one in Norway, had been affected, and proceeded to assess whether the incident was reportable under Article 33(1) GDPR.

On 24 September 2021, after concluding that the incident was indeed reportable, the controller hired a Norwegian law firm to notify the Norwegian DPA. Since the controller has several establishments in the EU/EEA, they also sent similar breach notifications to several other European supervisory authorities.

In this regard, they acknowledged that “Argon in the US [i.e., Argon Medical Devices, Inc.] is the data controller with respect to the personal data connected to this Incident”. They also stated that their ""European head office resides in Switzerland, and only its Swiss establishment enjoys a power of direction and control over its other EU/EEA establishments. Therefore, Argon does not have a main establishment in the EU/EEA for the purposes of Article 4(16) GDPR.""

Consequently, the DPA concluded that the cooperation mechanism and procedure set out in Article 56(1) GDPR and Article 60 GDPR did not apply in this case and, thus, pursuant to Article 55(1) GDPR, the DPA was competent to perform the tasks assigned to them and exercise the powers conferred on them by the GDPR in relation to the personal data breach notification. The controller did not dispute this in their written representations.

On 4 October 2021 the DPA sent the controller a request for further information and asked them to, in particular, clarify why they concluded that the incident was reportable only on 21 September 2021.

The controller held that they had acted ""without undue delay, to notify the supervisory authorities within 72 hours"". Their main claim was that it was necessary to investigate the incident in order to determine if it was reportable or not, which they were only able to conclude on 21 September 2021.

On 31 January 2022, the DPA sent the controller an advance notification of their intention to fine them NOK 2 500 000 for having violated Article 33(1) GDPR. Despite several exchanges where the controller continued to argue they had indeed sent the notification in time, the DPA upheld their conclusion and issued the final decision on 8 March 2023.

The controller then appealed the decision to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board, where it's currently pending.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves Argon Medical Devices, Inc. as the data controller under GDPR, responsible for processing personal data of European employees, including one in Norway, making them subject to GDPR obligations (Article 4(7)).

2. The controller discovered a cybersecurity incident on 14 June 2021 but only notified the Norwegian DPA on 24 September 2021, more than three months later (Case Facts).

3. Article 33(1) GDPR requires that ""the controller shall, without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55.""

4. The controller became aware of the breach on 14 June 2021 when they discovered the incident and implemented containment measures, triggering the 72-hour notification deadline (Case Facts).

5. The controller's argument that they needed to investigate to determine reportability does not justify the delay, as Article 33(1) requires notification when the controller becomes aware of the breach itself, not after completing a full investigation. The GDPR allows providing information in phases if not all details are initially available (Article 33(4)).

6. The controller's realization on 19 July 2021 that European employees' data was affected does not reset the 72-hour clock, as awareness of the breach occurrence (14 June) rather than full comprehension of all consequences triggers the notification obligation (Article 33(1)).

7. The DPA correctly determined that the cooperation mechanism (Article 56) did not apply since the controller had no main establishment in the EU/EEA, making the Norwegian DPA competent under Article 55(1) (Case Facts).

8. The controller's failure to notify within 72 hours of becoming aware on 14 June 2021 constitutes a clear violation of Article 33(1), regardless of their ongoing investigation.

9. The DPA's imposition of an administrative fine under Article 83 is justified for this infringement, which falls under the higher tier of violations (up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover) as it concerns failure to comply with breach notification obligations (Article 83(4)-(a)).

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"This case concerns the Bank of Ireland (BOI) (the controller) and a data breach on the “BOI365” online banking platform. Between 30 January 2020 and 6 May 2020 the Irish DPA (DPC) received ten personal data breach notifications. In six of these breaches, unauthorised persons gained access to customer accounts online as a result of bank staff not following procedures correctly. The other four breaches were a result of flaws in the customer information system.

On 12 August 2020, the DPC commenced an inquiry and the controller provided submissions on 25 November 2022 concerning: risk; methodology for assessment; testing; training and quality assurance; and categorisation of BOI’s actions.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves the Bank of Ireland (BOI) as a data controller processing personal data through its ""BOI365"" online banking platform, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1).

2. Between 30 January 2020 and 6 May 2020, BOI experienced ten personal data breaches: six resulting from bank staff not following procedures correctly, and four resulting from flaws in the customer information system. These breaches constitute unauthorized access to personal data, which is a security incident under the definition of ""personal data breach"" in Article 4(12).

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. The breaches indicate BOI failed to implement such measures effectively.

4. Article 5(1)(f) establishes the principle of integrity and confidentiality, requiring that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access. The multiple breaches demonstrate a failure to maintain this principle.

5. Article 24(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation. The recurring nature of the breaches (ten incidents over four months) suggests BOI failed to implement adequate measures and demonstrate compliance.

6. Article 32(2) requires that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller. The six breaches caused by staff not following procedures indicate a failure in ensuring compliance with this requirement.

7. The DPC's inquiry and BOI's submissions regarding risk assessment, testing, training, and quality assurance suggest these areas were inadequate, further indicating non-compliance with Articles 24, 25 (data protection by design and by default), and 32.

8. The nature and number of breaches, affecting multiple customers over an extended period, demonstrate a failure to implement appropriate security measures as required by Article 32, and to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personal data as required by Article 5(1)(f).

9. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The data subject was the victim of a crime that was being covered by the media in Spain. During the case trial, the the data subject gave a testimony reporting the details of the crime. Telecinco, the controller, and other media channels, released the original audio without distorting the data subject's voice.

The DPA initiated an investigation after a complaint was filed and ordered the controller to remove the data subject's voice from their website. In response, the controller argued that the mere hypothetical possibility of singling out an individual is not sufficient to consider the person as identifiable. In their view, taking into account all the means that may reasonably be used by the controller or any other person, such a possibility does not exist or is either negligible. Therefore, the voice cannot be considered as personal data. It also claimed that the original source of the data was the Court, which distributed the recording to all media channels without applying any prior voice distortion or giving any instructions in this regard. Finally, it alleged that coverage of crimes is of public interest and that restricting the publication would infringe their right to freedom of expression.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves the processing of the data subject's voice recording by Telecinco (the controller), which constitutes personal data as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR, as it relates to an identified or identifiable natural person through voice characteristics.

2. The controller processed special category data (voice as biometric data) under Article 9(1) without meeting any exception under Article 9(2), as the processing lacked explicit consent, was not necessary for reasons of substantial public interest under Union/Member State law, and did not involve suitable safeguards for journalistic purposes under Article 85.

3. The controller violated the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) by processing personal data without a valid legal basis, as the public interest claim for unmasked voice publication was not proportionate under Article 6(1)(f) and Article 85(2), given the availability of less intrusive measures (e.g., voice distortion).

4. The controller failed to provide adequate information to the data subject under Article 14, as the data was obtained from the court (a third party), and no transparency was ensured regarding processing purposes or data subject rights.

5. The processing violated the data subject’s rights under Article 17 (right to erasure), as the data was no longer necessary for the original purpose (court proceedings), and the data subject objected to further processing under Article 21(1).

6. The controller’s argument that voice data is not identifiable is invalid under Article 4(1), as voice biometrics directly identify an individual, and Recital 26 clarifies that account must be taken of all means reasonably likely to be used for identification.

7. The journalistic exemption under Article 85(2) does not apply unconditionally, as Member States must balance freedom of expression with data protection rights. Spain’s implementation requires proportionality, which was not met here due to the lack of voice distortion.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"Hackers invaded the information systems of the accommodation service provider Forenom, the controller. They gained access to a database containing approximately 165.000 personal details of the controller's customers. After receiving complaints from affected data subjects, the Finnish DPA  launched investigations to ascertain the circumstances of the data leak. When asked to comment on the facts, the controller argued that the type of data collected depended on the group to which the person belonged, whether tenant, owner or company contacts. As for the data retention period, landlord and tenant information were kept for 10 years from the end of the tenancy or contract, while customer relationship management data were kept for 5 years since the last activity. According to the controller, long-term apartment rentals play a significant role in its business. Therefore, they found it necessary to keep the data to respond to eventual compensation claims that, based on the national Accounting Act, can be made within a 10-year time limit. After this period, the data were either deleted or anonymized.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves a data breach at Forenom, an accommodation service provider acting as a controller, where hackers accessed personal data of approximately 165,000 customers, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. The controller retained personal data for 10 years for tenants and landlords, citing the national Accounting Act's 10-year limitation period for compensation claims. However, Article 5(1)(e) (Storage Limitation) requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. The controller must demonstrate that such a long retention period is strictly necessary and proportionate to the purpose, which they failed to do adequately.

3. The data breach itself indicates a potential violation of Article 32 (Security of Processing), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The successful hack suggests insufficient security measures were in place to protect against unauthorized access.

4. The scale of the breach (165,000 affected data subjects) and the nature of the data (which may include special categories under Article 9) suggest that the processing likely required a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35, given the high risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons. There is no indication that such an assessment was conducted.

5. While the controller referenced the national Accounting Act, GDPR Article 5(2) (Accountability Principle) requires that the controller be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with all principles relating to processing of personal data, including storage limitation. The mere existence of a 10-year statutory period for compensation claims does not automatically justify 10-year retention of all personal data without specific justification and regular review of necessity.

6. The combination of excessive data retention, inadequate security measures leading to a major breach, and likely failure to conduct required impact assessments constitutes multiple violations of GDPR principles and obligations.

Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 17 July 2020, the Luxembourg DPA opened an investigation at Company A, operator of a website and mobile application, to verify the compliance of its activities with Articles 12(1), 13 and 14 GDPR. The investigation focused on the users of the website and mobile application and not on the employees.

The investigation showed that

* the privacy policy mentioned processing operations that were not actually carried out; 
* the privacy policy was not available on all the pages on which the company collected data; 
* regarding the mobile app, no privacy policy was available before the download and once the application was installed, the privacy policy was not easily accessible;
* the privacy policy was only available in two languages, whereas the website was available in three languages; and
* the privacy policy did not mention the length of time for which the data would be kept or the right to restrict processing.

The controller replied that the unavailability of the information was due to the attitude of the service provider who managed his site and application.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 13, Article 58","1. The case involves Company A as a controller processing personal data of users through its website and mobile application, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing of personal data by automated means.

2. Article 13 of GDPR requires controllers to provide specific information to data subjects when personal data is collected from them, including the purposes of processing, legal basis, recipients, retention periods, and data subject rights such as the right to restrict processing.

3. The investigation found that the privacy policy mentioned processing operations that were not actually carried out, which violates Article 5(1)(a) of GDPR, which requires personal data to be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, as providing inaccurate information is not transparent.

4. The privacy policy was not available on all pages where data was collected, violating Article 12(1) of GDPR, which requires controllers to provide information referred to in Article 13 in an easily accessible form.

5. For the mobile application, no privacy policy was available before download, and once installed, it was not easily accessible, violating Article 13 of GDPR, which requires information to be provided at the time when personal data is obtained, and Article 12(1), which requires easy accessibility.

6. The privacy policy was only available in two languages, while the website was available in three languages, which may not constitute easily accessible or intelligible information for all users, potentially violating Article 12(1)'s requirement for information to be provided in a clear and plain language and in an easily accessible form.

7. The privacy policy did not mention the length of time for which data would be kept, violating Article 13(2)(a) of GDPR, which requires information on the storage period or the criteria used to determine it.

8. The privacy policy did not mention the right to restrict processing, violating Article 13(2)(b) of GDPR, which requires information on the existence of the right to request restriction of processing.

9. The controller's argument that the service provider was responsible does not excuse non-compliance, as under Article 24 of GDPR, the controller is responsible for implementing appropriate measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, and under Article 28, processors must act on the controller's instructions, but the controller remains ultimately liable.

10. Therefore, based on violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1), 13(2)(a), and 13(2)(b) of GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"During a recruitment procedure, an employee of the Bank of Italy (the controller) accidentally sent an email to 500 participants, where the email address of each of the candidates was clearly visible. By using the carbon copy (CC) instead of the blind carbon copy (BCC) option, the employee disclosed the email addresses of the job applicants to one another.

The email in question contained general information including a feedback request. The employee did not inform the office in charge of data protection and the participants did not raise any complaints. Consequently, in the immediate aftermath of the event, the Bank could not activate a data breach procedure, which provides for the involvement of the DPO and other staff members responsible for compliance with the GDPR and the relevant national legislation.

When the controller became aware of the breach, it sent another email to the job applicants instructing them to delete the email containing the visible addresses and not to use them or disclose them to third parties. The controller also argued that the event was an isolated one and it did not reflect the organisational measures that the Bank of Italy applies to the protection of personal data.

The Italian DPA investigated the matter.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the Bank of Italy as a data controller processing personal data (email addresses) of job applicants during a recruitment procedure, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2.

2. The controller's employee accidentally disclosed the email addresses of 500 job applicants to all recipients by using CC instead of BCC, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.""

3. The disclosure constituted a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it involved ""unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data."" The controller failed to implement appropriate technical measures (such as proper email protocols) to prevent such unauthorized disclosure, violating Article 32(1), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

4. Under Article 33(1), the controller is required to notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach ""without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it."" The employee did not inform the office in charge of data protection immediately, and the controller only became aware later, but there is no indication that the breach was reported to the supervisory authority (Italian DPA) within the required timeframe.

5. Under Article 34(1), when a personal data breach ""is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,"" the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The email addresses could be used for phishing or other malicious purposes, posing a risk to the applicants. The controller's subsequent email instructing deletion did not constitute proper notification as required by Article 34, as it lacked details about the breach, its likely consequences, and measures taken, as specified in Article 33(3).

6. The controller argued that the event was isolated and did not reflect its organisational measures, but under Article 24(1), the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, including measures to prevent such breaches. The failure to use BCC indicates a lack of adequate data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

7. The Italian DPA investigated the matter and found the controller noncompliant, as the breach was not properly handled according to Articles 33 and 34, and appropriate security measures under Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 were not implemented.

"The Italian DPA after receiving complaint from Inder Kahlon on 24th February 2023 (Numero protocollo: 0033835) opened an investigation concerning ChatGPT, an AI service offered by the American company OpenAI. The investigation focused on three main areas.

First, the controller did not provide the data subjects whose personal data had been collected through the Internet with appropriate information about the processing.

Second, the DPA found that ChatGPT final outcome – its “answers” – despite based also on personal data and thus often containing personal data, did not always represent reality in an accurate way.

Finally, the investigation showed that OpenAI did not adopt any measure to check that users were above the minimum age requirement of 13 years.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 8, Article 13","1. The case involves OpenAI as a controller processing personal data through its ChatGPT service, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as it offers services to data subjects in the Union (Article 3(2)).

2. The Italian DPA found that OpenAI did not provide appropriate information to data subjects whose personal data was collected through the internet. Under Article 14, where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, categories of personal data, and other necessary details within a reasonable period. OpenAI's failure to provide this information constitutes a violation of Article 14.

3. The investigation revealed that ChatGPT's outputs, which are based on personal data, did not always accurately represent reality. Article 5(1)(d) requires that personal data be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, with every reasonable step taken to ensure that inaccurate data are erased or rectified. The generation of inaccurate personal data by ChatGPT violates this principle.

4. OpenAI failed to implement measures to verify that users were above the minimum age requirement of 13 years. Article 8(1) states that for information society services offered directly to a child, processing is lawful only if the child is at least 16 years old, or with parental consent for those below 16. Article 8(2) requires the controller to make reasonable efforts to verify such consent, considering available technology. OpenAI's lack of age verification measures violates these provisions.

5. Additionally, the failure to implement age verification measures relates to the broader obligation under Article 25 to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default, which includes protecting the rights of child data subjects.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 5(1)(d) (accuracy principle), Article 8 (child's consent), Article 14 (information provision where data not obtained from data subject), and Article 25 (data protection by design and by default)."
"The Spanish DPA launched an investigation against the controller, owner of a pornographic website, due to possible processing of personal data and profiling of minors under fourteen years of age. During the investigations, several violations of the GDPR were found.

Firstly, the controller denied the processing of minors' personal data, except for basic contact information in a specific section where the user must register with a username, password and email. However, their privacy policy indicated otherwise. It actually prohibited minors under 14 years of age from providing their data and required parental consent for those under 18. Similarly, the controller denied performing any profiling and stated that their cookies analyze visits primarily to see where users navigate on their pages. However, in their privacy policy they admit collecting IP addresses, names, email addresses and other data to generate a user profile. This profile includes: location, gender, age, sexual preferences and media content.

Secondly, the DPA observed that when a user entered the website for the first time, a pop-up window asked them to declare that they were of legal age. However, by clicking anywhere outside the confirmation area access to the website was allowed without any restrictions. Personal data, such as name and email, were collected when the user registered on the site without any age verification. Registered users could then access and share videos, see profiles of other users and share their own profiles.

Thirdly, by accepting the legal notice on cookies, users implicitly accepted their use and there was no option to access the website while rejecting the cookies.

Fourthly, the DPA verified that the controller was processing data for purposes other than those established in their privacy policy which stated that data would be shared with ""tax and accounting consultancy (in case of purchase through the website)."" However, in the activity records submitted to the DPA, they also included the processing of data to maintain a contractual relationship with the user.

Fifthly, there was no information in their privacy policy as to the retention period, but the controller stated that personal data obtained from non-registered users were kept for 365 days for statistical and marketing purposes, while personal data obtained from registered users were kept for an indefinite period. Moreover, the controller was not able to present proper records of the processing activities nor a general description of the technical and organizational security measures adopted.

Finally, the DPA noted that the controller requested data subjects to present their national ID in order to exercise their rights.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 8, Article 12, Article 13, Article 25, Article 30","1. The controller processes personal data of minors without effective age verification mechanisms, as users can access the website by clicking outside the age declaration pop-up, and registration requires only name and email without age checks. This violates Article 8, which requires that for children under 16 (or as per member state law), processing is lawful only with parental consent, and controllers must make reasonable efforts to verify such consent.

2. The controller denies profiling but admits in its privacy policy to collecting IP addresses, names, email addresses, and other data to generate user profiles including location, gender, age, and sexual preferences. This constitutes profiling under Article 4(4), and processing special category data (e.g., sexual orientation) without explicit consent as required by Article 9(2)(a) is prohibited under Article 9(1).

3. The website requires users to accept cookies to access the site, with no option to reject them, which violates Article 7, as consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Bundling consent with access is not free consent.

4. The controller processes data for purposes not stated in the privacy policy (e.g., maintaining contractual relationships beyond sharing with tax and accounting consultancy), which violates the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), requiring that data be collected for specified purposes and not further processed incompatibly.

5. The privacy policy lacks information on retention periods, though the controller stated different periods for registered and non-registered users. This violates Article 13(2)(a), which requires providing data subjects with information on the storage period or criteria used.

6. The controller fails to maintain records of processing activities as required by Article 30, which mandates that controllers document processing activities, including purposes, categories of data, and recipients.

7. The controller cannot provide a general description of technical and organizational security measures, violating Article 32, which requires implementing appropriate security measures and being able to demonstrate compliance.

8. The controller requires data subjects to present a national ID to exercise their rights, which may not be proportionate under Article 12(6), as additional information should only be requested if there are reasonable doubts about identity, and this should not unduly hinder the exercise of rights.

Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller is Cityscoot, a company that rents out shared electric scooters via a mobile application. The controller operated cross-border processing operations but its main establishment was in France. In accordance with Article 56, the CNIL was therefore competent. In May 2020, the CNIL organised an investigation of the controller's website and mobile app. This investigation mainly highlighted three points.

First, the company's scooters were equipped with electronic boxes containing a SIM card and a GPS geo-location system. This allowed location data to be collected every 30 seconds when the scooter was active and every 15 minutes when it was not. This data was collected by the company for the following purposes: detecting and handling traffic offenses, handling customer complaints, user support (in order to call for help in case of a user's fall), claims and theft management.

Second, the controller used 15 processors on the basis of contracts that did not contain all the information required by the GDPR. For example, one of the contracts did not mention the processor's obligation to make available to the controller all the information to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down. Another contract did not mention the purpose of the data processing or its duration.

Third, the controller did not provide information and did not have a consent banner for cookies on its website.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 28, Article 56","1. The case involves Cityscoot, a controller processing personal data through its electric scooter rental service, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data (e.g., location data) in the context of offering services to data subjects in the Union.

2. Regarding the collection of location data every 30 seconds (active) and 15 minutes (inactive), this constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2). The purposes stated (e.g., traffic offense detection, user support) require a lawful basis under Article 6. However, precise geolocation data may be considered special category data under certain interpretations (e.g., revealing movements indicative of personal behavior), but even if not, it is highly sensitive. The controller must ensure transparency (Articles 13 and 14) and proportionality (Article 5(1)(c)). Collecting location data at such frequent intervals, especially when the scooter is inactive, may violate the principle of data minimization, as it is not limited to what is necessary for the stated purposes (e.g., detecting traffic offenses does not require continuous tracking when the scooter is unused).

3. The use of 15 processors with contracts that lack required elements violates Article 28(3), which mandates that processing by a processor must be governed by a contract specifying, among other things, the subject-matter, duration, nature, and purpose of processing, and the obligations of the processor, including assisting the controller in ensuring compliance and providing information for audits. Specific violations include:
   - One contract missing the processor's obligation to make available all information to demonstrate compliance (Article 28(3)(h)).
   - Another contract lacking the purpose and duration of processing (Article 28(3)).
   These omissions mean the contracts do not provide sufficient guarantees to meet the requirements of Article 28, leading to noncompliance.

4. The absence of a cookie consent banner and failure to provide information on cookies violates the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC), which is referenced in Article 2(4) of the GDPR. Although the GDPR does not directly regulate cookies, it applies to the processing of personal data via cookies. The lack of a banner means the controller fails to obtain valid consent for storing or accessing information on users' devices, which is required under the ePrivacy Directive. This also breaches GDPR transparency obligations (Articles 13 and 14), as users are not informed about such processing.

5. Overall, the controller fails to demonstrate accountability (Article 5(2)) and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures (Article 24), as evidenced by the deficiencies in processor contracts and data collection practices.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The controller installed a GPS tracker on a company car.

The data subject, namely the employee using that company car, filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, indicating that he was not aware of the existence of the GPS tracker and that the controller did not inform him about the processing purposes, applicable legal grounds, and retention periods. Also, the data subject stated that the personal data collected through the GPS tracker were not only processed for the purpose of monitoring the company car.

Following this complaint, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. It revealed that the data controller processed the personal data collected through the GPS tracker, without providing the data subject with complete information in relation to such processing activities. Also, it was found that the controller processed the data for various purposes and that it collected location data outside of working hours.

The investigation also showed that the controller stored the data after the expiration of 30-day storage period, provided by Article 5 of Law No. 190/2018, without being able to prove that exceeding the 30-day period was based on justified reasons, as required under the law.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The controller processed personal data (location data via GPS tracker) without providing the data subject with complete information regarding the processing purposes, legal basis, and retention periods, violating Article 13(1)-(2) which requires controllers to provide such information at the time of data collection.

2. The controller processed location data outside working hours without a valid purpose, violating the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), which requires personal data to be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in an incompatible manner.

3. The controller stored personal data beyond the 30-day retention period specified by national law (Law No. 190/2018) without justified reasons, violating the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes.

4. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with data minimization principles under Article 5(1)(c), as processing location data outside working hours was not limited to what was necessary for the stated purposes.

5. The controller's inability to prove justified reasons for exceeding the statutory retention period violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2), which requires controllers to be responsible for and able to demonstrate compliance with all data protection principles.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Italian DPA opened a procedure concerning a newspaper publishing photographs of data subjects involved in police investigations. More specifically, these pictures were originally taken within police offices and for police purposes. The controller immediately removed the contents from its website and stated that it was not aware of the true nature of the images. The controller also claimed to have processed those data for journalistic purposes.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves a controller (the newspaper) processing personal data in the form of photographs of data subjects involved in police investigations, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(1) and (2) of the GDPR.

2. The personal data processed relates to criminal investigations or offences, which is subject to specific restrictions under Article 10 of the GDPR, requiring that such processing be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union or Member State law providing appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

3. The controller is not an official authority and did not have authorization under Union or Member State law to process such data, thus violating Article 10 of the GDPR.

4. The controller claimed journalistic purposes, which may allow for derogations under Article 85 of the GDPR. However, Article 85 requires that such derogations are provided by Member State law and must be necessary to reconcile the right to data protection with freedom of expression and information. In this case, the processing was not justified as necessary for journalistic purposes, as the images were obtained from police offices without proper authorization, and the controller's lack of awareness of the true nature of the images indicates a failure to adhere to required safeguards or proportionality measures under Member State law implementing Article 85.

5. Under Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent. The controller's lack of awareness of the true nature of the images and the source (police offices) suggests that the processing was not fair or transparent, violating this principle.

6. The controller also has an obligation under Article 5(2) (accountability principle) to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles, which was not met due to the failure to verify the nature and lawfulness of the data processed.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Italian DPA investigated the Italian company Problem Solving s.r.l. (the Company) after having adopted a decision against the telephone company Vodafone Italia S.p.A. in November 2020. The DPA made an information request to the Company to which the Company replied on 5 November 2021.

The Company acted as a telesales partner of Vodafone, and acquired lists containing contact details from third party providers to further communicate the lists to Vodafone. The agreement between Vodafone and the Company was about the execution of outbound and inbound call management services for the promotion of commercial campaigns. The agreement did not mention the activity of acquiring lists of contact details on behalf of Vodafone.

The Company acquired contact lists containing approximately 4,300,000 personal data and communicated them to Vodafone between 2019 and 2020. The lists were acquired from third parties, Ad-Opera s.r.l. and BR Pharma s.r.l. The initial list provider was Ad-Opera s.r.l. which the Company chose to replace in 2020 with BR Pharma s.r.l. The latter was deemed more fit to raise the quality level of the Company’s activities.

During the investigation, the Company claimed that it did not have any decision-making role on the use of any lists and viewed Vodafone as the controller. Vodafone, it argued, only allowed the use of the lists after a rigorous verification procedure. The Company argued that it uploaded the contact details on the ""Vodafone Deduplica Liste"" system, in order to obtain ""validation"" from Vodafone and to act in compliance with the will and purposes of Vodafone which the Company held was the controller. The Company also highlighted that it did not proceed to any further use of the lists of contact details in question.

The DPA established that the company acquired approximately 4,300,000 personal data from Ad-Opera and BR Pharma, which the Company then had communicated to Vodafone for the purpose of carrying out promotional campaigns. The DPA considered this as carrying out a transfer between independent controllers.

The DPA initiated the proceedings against the Company on 11 March 2022, in which it challenged the Company for several violations. First, (i) violation of Article 13 GDPR, by not informing the data subjects included in the Ad-Opera and Br Pharma’s lists about the data sharing with Vodafone Second, infringement of Articles 5(1)(a), 6 and 7, for having disclosed the data referred to in point (i) above without the data subjects’ prior consent.

The Company then submitted a defence statement and requested a hearing.

The Company had provided information notices of the third party list providers to the DPA which the DPA had analysed. During the hearing, the Company provided a new information notice and exhibited e-mails with Vodafone. The Company argued that on the basis of the new information notice and the e-mail exchange, it was clear Vodafone had acknowledged its role of being the sole controller.

The Company argued that it had always acted as Vodafone's intermediary and processor, even during the phase of the acquisition of the lists of personal data. It also referred to the content of the EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor under the GDPR, highlighting that such concepts are ""functional rather than formal"". Also during the hearing, the Company highlighted its constant attention to the aspects related to the protection of personal data, with constant verifications that it always brought to Vodafone's attention.

The Company saw that the processing of personal data for the purpose of acquiring new personal data lists was part of the complex of processing operations aimed at the promotional contact of potential customers, processing for which Vodafone was unquestionably the sole controller. The Company represented that it carried out the activities only in the interest of Vodafone, without any autonomous business assessment.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 13, Article 28","1. The case involves Problem Solving s.r.l. (the Company) processing personal data by acquiring contact lists from third-party providers (Ad-Opera s.r.l. and BR Pharma s.r.l.) and transferring them to Vodafone Italia S.p.A. for promotional campaigns, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1).

2. The Company claimed it acted as a processor for Vodafone, but the DPA determined it acted as a controller during the acquisition and transfer of the contact lists. According to Article 4(7), a controller is the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing. The Company autonomously selected the third-party list providers (choosing to replace Ad-Opera with BR Pharma) and decided to acquire and transfer the data, demonstrating independent decision-making over the processing purposes and means.

3. As a controller, the Company was obligated under Article 14 to provide information to data subjects whose personal data were not obtained directly from them, including details about the processing purposes, legal basis, and data recipients. The Company failed to provide this information, violating Article 14(1)-(3) and, by extension, Article 13 principles regarding transparent information.

4. The processing of personal data for promotional communications requires a lawful basis under Article 6. The Company disclosed approximately 4,300,000 personal data to Vodafone without obtaining prior consent from the data subjects or establishing another valid legal basis (e.g., legitimate interests assessment under Article 6(1)(f)), violating Articles 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, transparency), 6, and 7.

5. The Company argued it acted under Vodafone's instructions, but the agreement between them did not cover list acquisition activities, and the Company's autonomous actions in selecting providers and transferring data indicate controller responsibilities. The EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 emphasize that roles are functional, not formal, and the Company's operational decisions confirm its controller role.

6. The transfer of data between independent controllers (from the Company to Vodafone) requires compliance with GDPR principles, including ensuring a lawful basis for the disclosure. The Company did not verify that Vodafone had obtained proper consent or another lawful basis for the subsequent processing, further violating accountability principles under Article 5(2).

7. The DPA's investigation found that the Company processed personal data without fulfilling information obligations (Article 14) and without a lawful basis (Article 6), leading to infringements of Articles 5(1)(a), 6, 7, and 13/14.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A news report revealed that the flight attendants working for Icelandair were required to evaluate each other at work. This led the Icelandic DPA to open an investigation on the compliance of that mechanism with GDPR. On 19 May 2022, the DPA informed Icelandair of the investigation and invited it to provide explanation.

Icelandair explained that it ran an app called Crew App containing a possibility to evaluate the performance of colleagues. It works in the following way: 45 minutes after landing, the app announces that the performance evaluation is open. Flight attendants can then submit evaluation for 48 hours. This evaluation includes a grade from 1 to 5 with a written justification and text boxes where it is possible to enter text. The employees can consult their own average evaluation in the program only if they participated in performance evaluation of others.

The company explained that the purpose of the evaluation was to make employees aware of their performance. It also argued that the collective agreement between Icelandair and the Flight Attendants Association of Iceland stated among other things that performance must be taken into account when offering promotions and management positions. Therefore, regarding the legal basis, Icelandair stated (1) to have a legitimate interest in the performance evaluation and (2) that it is necessary to perform a contractual obligation arising from the collective agreement with the Flight Attendants Association. Finally, the company stated that the processing met the transparency requirements: the staff received a detailed introduction to use the app and could request access to their data under Article 15 GDPR.

The company also believed that it was not obliged to carry out a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 GDPR due to the nature of the processing: assessment and grading. It considered that this processing could not be seen as systematic or on a large scale of special categories of personal data since the data were provided only on a voluntary basis, whenever the employees decided to enter it.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 15, Article 35","1. The processing of personal data through the Crew App involves peer evaluations of flight attendants, including grades and written justifications, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. Icelandair claims legal basis under Article 6(1)(b) (contractual necessity) and Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests). However, for Article 6(1)(b), the processing must be necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject. The peer evaluations are not directly necessary for the employment contract of each data subject but are a management tool, and the collective agreement with the Flight Attendants Association does not automatically make such processing necessary for individual contracts, thus violating Article 6(1)(b).

3. For Article 6(1)(f), legitimate interests must be balanced against the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Icelandair did not demonstrate that it conducted a legitimate interest assessment or implemented adequate safeguards, and the peer evaluation system could infringe on employees' privacy rights, especially since written justifications might include subjective or sensitive information, leading to a violation of Article 6(1)(f).

4. The written justifications in evaluations may include special categories of personal data, such as health information (e.g., if comments relate to physical or mental health), which is prohibited under Article 9(1) without an exception. Icelandair did not cite any exception under Article 9(2), such as explicit consent, thus violating Article 9.

5. Under transparency obligations, since personal data is obtained from colleagues (not from the data subject themselves), Article 14 applies. Article 14 requires that data subjects be informed of the source of the data and other information within a reasonable period. Icelandair's introduction to the app may not have adequately informed each employee about the processing of their data by others, violating Article 14(1)(f) and Article 14(2)(b) regarding legitimate interests.

6. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is required under Article 35(3)(a) for systematic evaluation of personal aspects that produce legal effects or similarly significant effects. The regular evaluations after each flight are systematic, and they influence promotions and management positions, which could significantly affect employees' careers. Icelandair's failure to conduct a DPIA violates Article 35.

7. The processing may also violate the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as collecting written justifications might not be necessary for the purpose of performance evaluation, and the principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d), as peer assessments may not be reliable.

8. Therefore, based on violations of legal basis (Article 6), processing of special categories (Article 9), transparency (Article 14), and DPIA requirements (Article 35), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"In the context of some processing operations already subject to investigation, the Italian DPA found that some controllers outsourced marketing services to Razmataz Live s.r.l. - a company active in the field of promotion of cultural activities. Razmataz relied in turn on another company, Flowers R, for the actual sending of marketing communications.

Since Razmataz did not reply to the supervisory authority's request of information, in May 2022 the DPA notified to the company the opening of a sanctioning procedure against it.

In its submission Razmataz claimed that the company did not assume any data protection role, as the marketing communications were sent by Flowers R according to the instructions directly issued by Razmataz's clients. Razmataz merely established a connection between Flowers R and such clients. Indeed, Razmataz did not have access to the contact details of the recipients of the marketing messages.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 28","1. The case involves Razmataz Live s.r.l., which was engaged by controllers to provide marketing services, and subsequently engaged Flowers R for sending marketing communications, placing Razmataz in a potential data processing role under GDPR (Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processor').

2. Razmataz claimed it did not assume any data protection role, arguing that Flowers R acted on instructions directly from Razmataz's clients and that Razmataz merely established connections without accessing recipient contact details.

3. Under Article 28(1), when a controller uses a processor (like Razmataz potentially acting as a processor for its clients), the controller must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures. If Razmataz was a processor, it would need to comply with Article 28 requirements.

4. Article 28(2) requires that processors (like Razmataz, if it engaged Flowers R) not engage another processor (Flowers R) without prior specific or general written authorisation from the controller. Razmataz's arrangement appears to involve engaging Flowers R without demonstrating proper authorisation from the original controllers.

5. Article 28(3) mandates that processing by a processor be governed by a binding contract stipulating specific data protection obligations. There is no indication that Razmataz had such a contract with Flowers R, which would be a violation.

6. Article 28(4) states that if a processor engages another processor, the same data protection obligations must be imposed on that sub-processor via contract, and the initial processor remains fully liable. Razmataz failed to demonstrate such contractual arrangements with Flowers R.

7. Article 24(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance. The original controllers (who engaged Razmataz) bear responsibility for ensuring their processors (Razmataz) comply, and Razmataz similarly must ensure compliance by any sub-processors (Flowers R).

8. Article 5(2) (accountability principle) requires controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the principles relating to processing of personal data. Razmataz's failure to properly oversee Flowers R and its lack of contractual safeguards violate this principle.

9. Additionally, Razmataz's failure to reply to the supervisory authority's request for information violates Article 31, which requires controllers and processors to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller was a Budapest-based company that operated the Spandora Beauty Centre, where facial and body treatments and medical aesthetic procedures were performed. The controller also distributed cosmetic products.

The DPA received several notifications in which clients and employees of the controller complained about cameras recording image and sound in all premises (offices, treatment rooms, corridors, reception) at its headquarters.

The DPA launched an official investigation on 19 October 2021 and carried out an on-site visit on 20 October 2021. The main issues arising from the very detailed investigation can be summarized as follows:

First, the cameras were monitoring the room where the staff eats, the training rooms and customer treatment rooms (implying that clients were often seen in incomplete clothing). The purpose of this processing was however not clearly defined nor communicated.

Second, the controller explained that only a few specific people had access to the recordings. However, the on-site visit showed that the camera images were also seen by the sales manager, who used them to check that the staff was communicating properly with the clients. The recordings were available on a computer in an unlocked room. To access them, one could click on a shortcut and enter a username which was written on a piece of paper stuck to the monitor.

Third, all clients had to fill in and sign a consultation form which mentioned the placement of cameras for the purpose of protecting clients and staff. It however did not mention the recording of audio. The investigation also showed that there was no mention of the cameras in the privacy notice in force.

Fourth, the controller stored health data in the client database, including Covid vaccination status, pregnancy, and sicknesses.

Fifth, the controller stated that the signature of the consultation form constituted a consent to the processing of their data for a marketing purpose. Later, the controller held that this processing was based on legitimate interest, and then in a further contradictory declaration, it stated that it did not use client data for such purposes",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32","1. The controller processed personal data (video and audio recordings) without a clearly defined purpose, violating the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a). The purpose was not communicated to data subjects as required by Article 13(1)(c).

2. Audio recordings in treatment rooms where clients were often in incomplete clothing constituted processing of special categories of personal data (potentially revealing health information or intimate details) without a valid exception under Article 9(1) or (2). No appropriate safeguards or legal basis was established for such processing.

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security, as recordings were accessible via a computer with credentials visibly displayed, violating Article 32(1) on security of processing and Article 25 on data protection by design and by default.

4. The consultation form mentioned video recording but omitted audio recording, and the privacy notice lacked any reference to surveillance, violating Article 13's requirement to provide comprehensive information about processing activities to data subjects.

5. Storage of health data (Covid vaccination status, pregnancy, and sicknesses) in the client database occurred without a valid legal basis under Article 9(2) or appropriate safeguards, violating the prohibition on processing special categories of data.

6. The controller inconsistently claimed consent, legitimate interest, and then denial of processing for marketing purposes, demonstrating an inability to demonstrate lawful processing under Article 6(1) and failing to comply with the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

7. Surveillance in staff break rooms and treatment rooms was disproportionate and violated the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), as monitoring was not limited to what was necessary for specified purposes.

8. The controller failed to conduct a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 for high-risk processing operations (continuous surveillance and health data processing), despite the clear obligation to do so.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller – Ediscom S.p.A. – was a marketing company whose business consisted in contacting potential customers on behalf of third vendors through sms, emails and automated calls. In order to conduct this activity, the company made use of an extensive database including contact details of more than 21 million people. Personal data were collected both directly by Ediscom and by third parties. In general, Ediscom acknowledged to act as a controller. However, in some cases, Ediscom rented databases from third parties with an aim of monetising them. Although costs and profits were shared, Ediscom considered itself a processor on behalf of the owners of such databases.

Ediscom regularly received withdrawals of consent and erasure requests. As Ediscom relied on several databases with partial overlap of data, it usually put these requests in blacklists in order to avoid to reimport the same data from another source – and use them again. Whenever it considered to operate as a processor, Ediscom notified the original controller about erasure or withdrawal of consent requests.

Some data subjects claimed to have objected to the processing for marketing purposes. However, they still received calls and messages from Ediscom. In the context of these complaints, the Italian DPA started a broader investigation about the Ediscom’s business practices. The investigation concerned both the websites used by the controller to directly collect personal data and personal data disclosed to Ediscom by third parties.

On several websites managed by the Ediscom, users were invited to take part to lotteries or to subscribe to cooking or health newsletters. Theoretically, users could choose whether the Ediscom was allowed to use and share their data for marketing purposes. In practice, the supervisory authority identified numerous GDPR violations.

Several GDPR infringements could also be found with regard to personal data originally collected by third parties.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 13, Article 14, Article 24, Article 25","1. The case involves Ediscom S.p.A., which processes personal data for marketing purposes. Ediscom acts as a controller when it determines the purposes and means of processing, as defined in Article 4(7) of the GDPR, but it also misclassifies itself as a processor in some scenarios, leading to failures in fulfilling controller obligations.

2. Ediscom collects personal data directly from data subjects through websites offering lotteries or newsletters. Article 13 requires that controllers provide specific information to data subjects at the time of data collection, including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, and legal basis. The investigation found violations in this regard, indicating that Ediscom failed to provide adequate information as mandated.

3. When obtaining consent for marketing, Article 7(1) requires that consent be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The use of lotteries or newsletters to obtain consent may involve bundling, where consent is conditional on participation, which is not freely given under Article 7(4), thus violating consent requirements.

4. Data subjects have the right to withdraw consent under Article 7(3), and withdrawal must be as easy as giving consent. Ediscom received withdrawals but data subjects still received marketing communications, indicating that withdrawals were not effectively implemented, violating Article 7(3).

5. Under Article 21, data subjects have the right to object to processing for direct marketing at any time. The case states that data subjects objected but still received calls and messages, which directly violates Article 21.

6. For personal data obtained from third parties, Article 14 requires that the controller provide information to data subjects within a reasonable period. Ediscom used data from third parties, and the investigation found violations, suggesting that Ediscom failed to provide the required information under Article 14.

7. Ediscom's use of blacklists for erasure requests under Article 17 may not constitute proper erasure, as data could be reimported from other sources, failing to ensure complete and timely erasure as required by Article 17(1).

8. When Ediscom acts as a processor for rented databases, it must comply with Article 28, which requires processing only on documented instructions from the controller. However, if Ediscom is determining purposes, it should be a controller, and misclassification could lead to violations of accountability principles under Article 5(2).

9. The Italian DPA investigation confirmed multiple GDPR infringements, including failures in consent mechanisms, information provision, and respect for data subject rights, as outlined in Articles 7, 13, 14, 17, and 21.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The controller - an individual - installed cameras in a public toilet. The system had a sensor that activated cameras and started recording as soon as a person entered the monitored area. A criminal investigation started against the controller. When asked why he decided to install the cameras, the controller claimed to have a “technical interest”: indeed, they needed to test the cameras. They specifically targeted public toilets because this decision had “a certain appeal of the illicit”.

Notified by the police in the context of the criminal proceeding, the Austrian DPA opened a second investigation.

The controller claimed to have erased the data and not to have disclosed the data to third parties. Moreover, the controller pointed out that people appearing in the video recordings were not identifiable. Consequently, processing did not involve personal data and the GDPR did not apply, according to the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 6","1. The case involves a controller (an individual) who installed cameras in a public toilet, recording individuals without their knowledge, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4 of the GDPR, as the recordings relate to identifiable natural persons in a sensitive context, regardless of the controller's claim of non-identifiability.

2. The processing lacks a lawful basis under Article 6, as the controller's stated purpose (""technical interest"" and testing with ""illicit appeal"") does not meet any of the conditions for lawful processing, such as consent, contractual necessity, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests (which are overridden by the fundamental rights of data subjects in this context).

3. The processing violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as secretly recording individuals in a public toilet is inherently unfair and non-transparent, and the purpose is not legitimate.

4. The processing involves special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), such as data concerning health or intimate behavior, which is prohibited without explicit consent or other narrow exceptions, none of which apply here (e.g., the controller did not obtain explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a)).

5. The controller's claim that data was erased and not disclosed does not rectify the initial unlawful processing, as compliance must be demonstrated under the accountability principle (Article 5(2)), and the erasure does not negate the prior infringement.

6. The controller's argument that the data is not personal is invalid under Article 4, as individuals in a public toilet could be identified directly or indirectly (e.g., through context, timing, or other means), and the GDPR applies to any information relating to an identifiable person.

7. The case involves processing for purposes beyond the original intent without justification, violating the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b), as the controller's ""technical interest"" and ""illicit appeal"" indicate incompatible purposes.

8. The Austrian DPA's investigation is justified under Article 57(1)(a), as supervisory authorities must monitor and enforce GDPR compliance, and the criminal investigation does not preclude DPA action under Article 58.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations of Articles 5, 6, and 9, among others."
"The controller, Tensa Art Design SA, was an optician and merchant for glasses, sunglasses as well as contact lenses. As part of its business the controller was sending commercial messages.

A data subject, objected to receiving the commercial messages as foreseen by Article 21 GDPR, by unsubscribing from the newsletter service. Yet, the controller continued to send commercial communications to the data subject's phone number via SMS in a frequent manner. Consequently, the data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, prompting the DPA to investigate the matter.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 21","1. The case involves a controller, Tensa Art Design SA, processing personal data (specifically, the data subject's phone number) for direct marketing purposes by sending commercial SMS messages, as defined under Article 4(2) of the GDPR, which includes operations such as transmission of personal data.

2. The data subject exercised the right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes by unsubscribing from the newsletter service, which is a valid objection under Article 21(2) of the GDPR, granting the data subject the right to object at any time to processing for direct marketing.

3. Article 21(3) of the GDPR explicitly states that where the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes, meaning the controller must immediately cease sending commercial communications.

4. Despite the data subject's objection, the controller continued to send commercial SMS messages, thereby violating Article 21(3) by failing to halt processing for direct marketing purposes.

5. This continued processing also violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, as processing without a valid legal basis (e.g., consent or legitimate interests) after objection is unlawful, and the controller did not demonstrate any overriding legitimate grounds under Article 21(1).

6. Furthermore, the controller's actions may constitute a failure to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2) of the GDPR, which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of rights, including the right to object.

7. The Romanian DPA investigated the matter and found the controller noncompliant due to these violations, leading to the verdict of NONCOMPLIANT.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Romanian Ombudsman forwarded to the Romanian DPA, several notifications. These notifications were mentioning that Salvati Romania Union Party (in Romanian: Partidul Salvati Romania  - USR), the controller, published on its website personal data belonging to several data subjects. These data included the data subjects' degrees of disability.

Following such, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. It revealed that the data controller operator collected the personal data  i.e. name, surname, personal numerical code (a unique 13 digits number assigned to Romanians and Romanian residents), address, identity card number, medical certificate number, degree of disability, from official documents of authorities and public institutions and later published them on the party's website, as part of a project.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves Salvati Romania Union Party (USR) as a data controller, which collected and published personal data including names, identification numbers, addresses, and degrees of disability from official documents on its website, as confirmed by the Romanian DPA's investigation.

2. The processed data includes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), specifically ""data concerning health"" (degrees of disability), which is prohibited from processing unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies.

3. The controller processed this sensitive data without obtaining explicit consent from data subjects (Article 9(2)(a)), and no other exception under Article 9(2) appears applicable (e.g., processing was not necessary for reasons of substantial public interest under Union/Member State law under Article 9(2)(g)), as the political party's project does not constitute a lawful basis for such processing.

4. The personal data was not obtained directly from data subjects but from official documents, yet the controller failed to provide the information required under Article 14, including the source of the data and the purposes of processing, within the specified timeframes (Article 14(3)).

5. The processing violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as there is no valid legal basis under Article 6 for processing special category data in this context, and the principle of fairness, as publishing sensitive health data without justification is inherently unfair to data subjects.

6. The processing violates the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b), as collecting data from official documents for administrative purposes and repurposing it for a political project without a compatible legal basis is impermissible.

7. The processing violates the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), as publishing full identification details and health data exceeds what is necessary for any legitimate purpose.

8. The controller failed to implement appropriate safeguards under Article 32 to protect sensitive data, given that publishing it online exposes data subjects to high risks without adequate security measures.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of GDPR provisions, including unlawful processing of special category data (Article 9), failure to provide required information (Article 14), and breaches of core principles (Article 5)."
"The case initiated from a complaint made by a data subject who filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA requesting the DPA to declare that a controller - a company providing accommodation services - within the neighbouring property unlawfully processes personal data with its surveillance camera systems (CCTV). The data subject requested the DPA to 1) prohibit the controller from monitoring the data subject's property with its CCTV systems, and 2) to order the controller to terminate the unlawful recordings.

The DPA extended the scope of the investigation (ex officio) against the controller. The DPA investigated all processing activities carried out by the controller with its CCTV systems and conducted an on-site inspection to the controller's property. The controller was using two CCTV systems that were identified within the investigation as Camera system No. 1 (consisting of 4 analogue cameras only providing live image) and Camera system No. 2 (consisting of 4 IP cameras recording image and audio) for which the recordings were said to be stored for three days by the controller.

The Camera system No. 1 showed views of the parking area within the property of the controller, a view from the gate to the building and to the reception area, and a small part of the backyard of the property, with a pavement leading to the reception area. The DPA noted that there were no recreational facilities located in these areas. The controller stated that the purposes of the CCTV in Camera sytem No. 1 were: 1) the protection of persons and property, 2) to detect possible infringements, 3) to catch a perpetrator in the act, and 4) to prevent infringing acts. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing.

With regard to Camera system No. 2 showed views of: 1) a dining room, 2) a panoramic jacuzzi on the terrace - which previously showed a view of the data subject's property, but at the time of the DPA's on-site investigation, the controller had modified the angle view of the camera away from the data subject's property - 3) a patio, and 4) a reception desk.  These cameras were motion-activated, recorded images, and some of them were placed with an angle of view to areas where the persons not only pass through but also rest and dine. Regardless of the DPA's request, the controller did not present any previous cases justifying the necessity for the use of the CCTV. The DPA considered that it was relevant whether any events had taken place in the past which would justify the placement of the cameras, as the data processing was more extensive compared to Camera system No 1. With regard to the previous monitoring of the data subject's property, the controller argued that it had had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f), because it had legitimate interests for property protection purposes as it had accused the data subject’s husband for vandalism towards the fence separating the two properties.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 31, Article 58","1. The case involves a controller (accommodation services company) processing personal data via CCTV systems, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data (video and audio recordings) forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) as the legal basis for processing. However, for legitimate interests to be valid, the processing must be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, and these interests must not be overridden by the data subject's interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6(1)(f)). The DPA found that the controller failed to demonstrate any previous incidents justifying the necessity of Camera System No. 2, particularly in areas where individuals rest and dine (e.g., dining room, jacuzzi), where there is a higher expectation of privacy. This violates the necessity and balancing test required under Article 6(1)(f).

3. Camera System No. 2 recorded audio in addition to video, which constitutes processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), as audio data may reveal biometric data or other sensitive information. The controller did not meet any of the exceptions under Article 9(2) (e.g., explicit consent, substantial public interest), making this processing unlawful.

4. The initial angle of Camera System No. 2 included the data subject's property, which exceeds the purpose of property protection and constitutes excessive processing contrary to the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), which requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes.

5. The storage of recordings for three days was not justified by the controller in relation to the purposes claimed (property protection and crime prevention), potentially violating the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in a form permitting identification no longer than necessary.

6. The processing operations, especially in areas like the jacuzzi and dining room, interfered with the data subjects' rights to privacy and data protection under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the controller failed to implement appropriate safeguards to protect these rights, as required under Article 24 (responsibility of the controller) and Article 25 (data protection by design and by default).

7. The DPA's investigation revealed that the controller did not conduct a proper assessment of the impact on data subjects' rights (e.g., through a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35) for the intrusive processing via Camera System No. 2, which was necessary given the high risks to rights and freedoms of natural persons.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In April 2021, more than 1 year after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Police of the Czech Republic began a wide collection of data on the health status of people infected with the coronavirus. The aim was to monitor compliance with isolation orders and prevent the spread of contagion. Until March 2022, sensitive data of approximately 2 million people were processed by the Ministry of the Interior. Upon becoming aware of the fact, the Czech DPA initiated an investigation into possible violations of data protection regulations.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 13, Article 35","1. The case involves the processing of sensitive health data related to COVID-19 infections by the Police of the Czech Republic (under the Ministry of the Interior), which qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The processed data (health status of infected individuals) constitutes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless specific conditions under Article 9(2) are met.

3. While Article 9(2)(i) allows processing for public health purposes, this must be based on Union or Member State law which provides for suitable safeguards. The case does not demonstrate that such specific legal basis existed for this processing operation.

4. The processing lacked a proper lawful basis under Article 6. While the controller might have claimed public interest under Article 6(1)(e), the scale and nature of the processing required a specific legal authorization that met the proportionality requirements.

5. The large-scale processing of sensitive data of approximately 2 million people would require a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(1) and (3)(a), particularly given the systematic monitoring of individuals. There is no indication this was conducted.

6. The principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)) were likely violated, as the collection of health data by police authorities for monitoring isolation compliance appears disproportionate to the stated objective.

7. The transparency requirements under Articles 13 and 14 were likely not fulfilled, as individuals should have been informed about the processing of their sensitive health data by law enforcement authorities.

8. The processing continued for nearly a year (April 2021 to March 2022) without proper legal basis or safeguards, indicating a systematic violation of multiple GDPR provisions.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"Aesse S.r.l.s., the controller, offered boiler maintenance services to the data subject via phone call. When the data subject asked the controller about the origin of the personal data, the controller was unable to specifically indicate to the data subject the source from which it had acquired the personal data.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Italian DPA claiming they never gave their consent to receive marketing communication. Moreover, the data subject claimed that the controller had been evasive in responding to the request concerning the origin of the personal data.

During the investigation, the controller stated that it had acquired a list of names and numbers that could be contacted for the purpose of marketing from a third party telemarketing company. The third party telemarketing company guaranteed that the names and the numbers on the list could be used for marketing purposes. The controller shared the list with both the Italian DPA and the data subject.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15","1. The case involves Aesse S.r.l.s. as the controller processing personal data (name and phone number) of the data subject for marketing purposes via phone calls, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope).

2. The data subject did not provide consent for marketing communications, and the controller obtained the personal data from a third-party telemarketing company rather than directly from the data subject, triggering the application of Article 14 (information to be provided where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject).

3. Article 14 requires the controller to provide specific information to the data subject, including ""from which source the personal data originate"" (Article 14(1)(f)), within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data (at latest within one month) or at the time of first communication (Article 14(3)(b)).

4. The controller failed to provide this source information when first contacting the data subject and was evasive in responding to the data subject's direct request, violating Article 14's transparency requirements and the controller's obligation under Article 12 to provide transparent information and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.

5. The controller's reliance on the telemarketing company's guarantee about marketing permissions does not absolve it from its direct obligations under Article 14 to inform data subjects of the source, as controllers remain responsible for compliance regardless of third-party involvement (Article 24, accountability principle).

6. The processing for marketing purposes without the data subject's consent likely violates Article 6(1)(a) (lawfulness of processing based on consent), as the controller could not demonstrate valid consent was obtained.

7. The controller's subsequent sharing of the list with the DPA and data subject does not remedy the initial violations of Articles 14 and 12, as the information was not provided within the required timeframes or in a transparent manner.

8. Therefore, the case involves multiple violations of the GDPR, including failures under Articles 14, 12, and likely Article 6, making it NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In February 2020, a housing association (the controller), which manages and maintains rental housing, fell victim to a theft of documents containing personal data of tenants (data subjects). These personal data consisted of names, addresses, bank account details as well as one notarial deed which, in addition, contained the personal identification number of two data subjects. However, the controller only informed one of the data subjects - the one whose personal data were on the notarial deed. It also failed to notify the Polish DPA as required by Article 33(1) GDPR.

In October 2020, the Polish DPA received an anonymous tip informing about this incident. The DPA started an investigation and requested information from the controller, including the number of affected data subjects and categories of data which had been stolen. The controller alleged that it had orally informed the data subjects about the data breach and that it was not aware that the DPA had to be notified as well. Additionally, the controller reported that it did not conclude a data processing agreement with the notarial firm (the processor) who prepared the deed.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 28, Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves a housing association acting as a data controller processing tenants' personal data, including names, addresses, bank account details, and personal identification numbers, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2.

2. The theft of documents containing personal data constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it involves the accidental destruction, loss, or unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

3. Under Article 33(1), the controller is required to notify the supervisory authority (Polish DPA) of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The controller failed to make this notification, which is a violation.

4. Under Article 34(1), when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The controller only informed one data subject (whose data was on the notarial deed) and claimed oral notification to others, but failed to demonstrate proper communication to all affected data subjects, especially given the sensitive nature of bank account details and personal identification numbers which pose high risks of identity theft or fraud.

5. The controller's failure to conclude a data processing agreement with the notarial firm (the processor) violates Article 28(3), which requires that processing by a processor be governed by a contract or other legal act that sets out the subject-matter, duration, nature, and purpose of processing, the type of personal data, and the obligations and rights of the controller.

6. The processing of personal identification numbers may involve special categories of personal data under certain conditions (e.g., if it reveals racial or ethnic origin), but even if not, the general principles of Article 5 (lawfulness, fairness, transparency) and security obligations under Article 32 are implicated by the breach and lack of safeguards.

7. The controller's claim of oral notification to data subjects does not necessarily fulfill the requirements of Article 34, which emphasizes clear and plain language communication, and the burden of demonstrating compliance rests with the controller under the accountability principle (Article 5(2)).

8. The anonymous tip and subsequent investigation by the DPA highlight the controller's failure to proactively comply with breach notification and transparency obligations, further underscoring noncompliance.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 33(1) (notification to supervisory authority), Article 34(1) (communication to data subjects), and Article 28(3) (data processing agreement)."
"Following a citizen’s inquiry, the Danish DPA initiated an investigation regarding a medical institute’s (Statens Serum Institut or SSI) fulfillment of the obligation to provide information under Article 14(1) to 14(4) GDPR with regard to certain operations carried out by the SSI.

The SSI receives and analyses biological samples taken from patients (for example blood samples) for diagnostic analysis purposes which is done as part of the institute's exercise of authority pursuant to Section 222 of the Danish Health Act. In addition, SSI processes other information about the person (e.g. the person’s name and ID number). After a diagnostic analysis has been carried out, often resulting excess biological material is stored in Denmark's National Biobank for future research purposes. The SSI argued that the exception under Article 14(5)(b) of said information obligations applies, as informing would require a disproportionately large effort in the form of large administrative and financial costs. The SSI's laboratory information system is over 20 years old and does not currently support automatic notifications which means that the SSI would need to inform individuals manually.

Additionally, the SSI viewed that the concerned persons’ interests were covered by making general information about the collection available online on their websites.

With regard to storing data in the national biobank for further research purposes, the SSI argued that the processing is compliant with the GDPR, as the further processing is not seen incompatible with the original processing purposes pursuant to Article 5(1)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 14","1. The case involves the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) processing personal data (biological samples and identifying information) obtained from individuals indirectly through healthcare providers, rather than directly from the data subjects themselves, which triggers the information obligations under Article 14 GDPR.

2. Article 14(1)-(4) GDPR requires controllers to provide specific information to data subjects when personal data have not been obtained from them, including details about the controller, processing purposes, categories of data, recipients, storage periods, data subject rights, and the source of the data, among other elements.

3. SSI argued that the exception under Article 14(5)(b) applies, claiming that providing this information would involve disproportionate effort due to their outdated laboratory information system requiring manual notification processes.

4. However, Article 14(5)(b) only exempts controllers from these information obligations where the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve disproportionate effort, specifically when processing is for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific/historical research, or statistical purposes, subject to conditions and safeguards in Article 89(1).

5. While SSI's storage in the national biobank for future research may qualify under Article 89(1), their initial processing for diagnostic analysis under Section 222 of the Danish Health Act constitutes a separate processing purpose (healthcare service delivery) not covered by the Article 14(5)(b) exception.

6. Even if the research purpose were considered, Article 14(5)(b) requires that controllers implement appropriate measures to protect data subjects' rights and freedoms, including making the required information publicly available. SSI's provision of general online information does not satisfy the specific, individualized information requirements of Article 14(1)-(4).

7. Regarding further processing for research purposes, while Article 5(1)(b) allows compatibility with original purposes for archiving/research under Article 89(1), this does not relieve SSI of its separate obligation to provide Article 14 information when data were not obtained from the data subject.

8. The Danish DPA found that SSI failed to demonstrate that the Article 14(5)(b) exception applied to their diagnostic processing activities and that their measures (general website information) were insufficient to fulfill their information obligations under GDPR.

9. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR's information provision requirements under Article 14."
"A data subject made an access request with Libra Internet Bank SA (data controller and a bank in Romania). The data subject required a copy of their personal data, including some video recordings to be sent to their physical address by mail. The controller failed to properly fullfil the access request, as required by the data subject and, as such, the data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian Data Protection Authority.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15","1. The case involves a data subject exercising their right of access under Article 15 of the GDPR by requesting a copy of their personal data, including video recordings, from Libra Internet Bank SA (the controller).

2. Article 12(3) requires the controller to provide information on action taken on an access request without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request. The controller failed to properly fulfill the access request within this timeframe.

3. Article 15(3) specifically grants the data subject the right to obtain a copy of their personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs, but must provide the first copy free of charge.

4. Article 12(1) requires the controller to take appropriate measures to provide any communication relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. When the data subject makes a request by electronic means, the information should be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.

5. In this case, the data subject specifically requested that the copy of their personal data (including video recordings) be sent to their physical address by mail. The controller failed to comply with this specific modality requested by the data subject.

6. The controller's failure to properly fulfill the access request as required by the data subject constitutes a violation of Articles 12 and 15 of the GDPR, specifically regarding the timeframe for response, the obligation to provide a copy of the personal data, and the requirement to accommodate the data subject's requested communication method.

"NN Pensii Societate de Administrare a unui Fond de Pensii Administrat Privat S.A. and NN Asigurări de Viață S.A., two insurance providers (controllers) owned by the same mother company were using an app (NN Direct) to facilitate the services offered to their customers.

Due to a software change in the app, a data breach occured. As result, some users were granted unauthorised access to the personal data of two other users (such as name, personal number, address, email, phone number).

The controllers notified the breach to the Romanian DPA which started an investigation for each controller. This investigation showed that the controllers did not test the app for its deployment after the software change and that none of them implemented periodic and documented tests and assessments.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves two insurance providers, NN Pensii Societate de Administrare a unui Fond de Pensii Administrat Privat S.A. and NN Asigurări de Viață S.A., acting as data controllers under the policy (Article 4: Definitions - 'controller').

2. A data breach occurred due to a software change in the NN Direct app, resulting in unauthorized access to personal data (including name, personal number, address, email, and phone number) of two users, which constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4: Definitions - 'personal data breach'.

3. The policy requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing (Article 32(1)(d)).

4. The investigation by the Romanian DPA revealed that the controllers did not test the app after the software change and did not implement periodic and documented tests and assessments, which violates Article 32(1)(d) of the policy.

5. The policy also establishes the principle of integrity and confidentiality, requiring that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage (Article 5(1)(f)).

6. The controllers' failure to test the software change and implement periodic assessments directly contravenes the accountability principle (Article 5(2)), as they were unable to demonstrate compliance with the security requirements.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"In December 2022, Croatian DPA received an anonymous complaint in which it was stated that a debt collection agency processed a large number of personal data of natural persons (debtors) without authorization. They also received a USB stick containing a database with personal data of debtors - first and last name, date of birth and personal identification number for a total of 77,317 natural persons who had outstanding debts to credit institutions, and which were purchased by the debt collection agency.

Following this complaint, the DPA launched an investigation and supervisory procedure.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves a debt collection agency processing personal data of 77,317 natural persons (debtors) including first and last names, dates of birth, and personal identification numbers without proper authorization, as reported to the Croatian DPA (Article 4 defines personal data and processing).

2. The debt collection agency purchased the database containing personal data, meaning the data were not obtained directly from the data subjects. According to Article 14, where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information to the data subject within a reasonable period, including the identity of the controller, the purposes of processing, the categories of personal data, and the source of the data. There is no indication that the agency provided this information to the data subjects.

3. The processing of personal identification numbers (a national identifier) falls under Article 87, which requires that such processing be done only under appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The agency did not demonstrate that such safeguards were in place.

4. The debt collection agency, as the controller, failed to ensure that the processing complied with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)). The purchase of personal data from an unauthorized source without a valid legal basis (such as consent or legitimate interests under Article 6) is unlawful.

5. The processing of special categories of data (such as personal identification numbers) requires a specific condition under Article 9. The agency did not have explicit consent or any other valid exception under Article 9(2) for processing this sensitive data.

6. The agency failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk (Article 32), as the data were received on a USB stick from an anonymous source, indicating inadequate security protocols.

7. The large-scale processing of personal data (77,317 individuals) likely required a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35, as it involves systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale. There is no evidence that such an assessment was conducted.

8. The agency did not fulfill its obligation to cooperate with the supervisory authority (Article 31) during the investigation, as the DPA had to initiate a supervisory procedure based on an anonymous complaint.

9. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The Danish publishing house Gyldendal A/S (the processor) offered a service to secondary education institutions. The service was used by teachers to create tests to screen students for their academic skill strengths and weaknesses. The tests were accessed with URLs and completed in a browser.

The URLs providing access to the tests consisted of 8 characters in total of which 2 characters were randomised. In practice, this meant that a student – knowingly or unknowingly (e.g. as a result of mistyping the URL) – could complete a test set up by a teacher from another school. In this case, the teacher from another school would gain unauthorised access to the student's personal data (name, email and test results).

The shortened URLs (with 8 characters) were specifically requested by the secondary education institutions (the controllers) whose IT systems did not allow longer URLs.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves secondary education institutions as controllers and Gyldendal A/S as a processor, jointly determining the purposes and means of processing student personal data (names, emails, test results) through a testing service, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 4 definitions of 'controller', 'processor', and 'personal data'.

2. The controllers (schools) specifically requested shortened URLs with only 8 characters (2 randomized), despite knowing their IT systems' limitations, thereby influencing the processing means. This arrangement should have been governed by a transparent agreement outlining respective responsibilities for compliance, as required under Article 26 on joint controllers, but such safeguards were not adequately implemented.

3. The URL design with minimal randomization (2 out of 8 characters) created a high risk of unauthorized access, as students could accidentally or intentionally access tests from other schools. This violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires processing to ensure appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized access.

4. The processor (Gyldendal) failed to implement appropriate technical measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as mandated by Article 32. The low entropy in URL generation made it easily guessable, contrary to the requirement to implement measures that ensure ongoing confidentiality.

5. The controllers and processor did not adhere to data protection by design and by default under Article 25. They should have implemented pseudonymization or other measures (e.g., longer URLs with higher randomization) to mitigate risks, especially given the sensitive nature of academic performance data, which may infer special category data under Article 9.

6. The processing led to unauthorized disclosure of personal data to teachers at other schools, constituting a personal data breach under Article 4(12). The controllers failed to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay (within 72 hours) as required under Article 33, and did not communicate the breach to affected data subjects under Article 34, given the high risk to students' rights.

7. The controllers, as joint controllers, did not ensure the processor provided sufficient guarantees under Article 28(1) to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. The processor's compliance with the controllers' request for insecure URLs demonstrates a failure in this obligation.

8. The risk of unauthorized access was foreseeable and should have been addressed through a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under Article 35, given the systematic monitoring and processing of sensitive data on a large scale. No evidence suggests a DPIA was conducted or that safeguards were implemented.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 25, 26, 28, 32, 33, 34, and 35."
"The data subject lived in a building managed by a housing association, the controller, and was dissatisfied with its administration, especially due to the increase in utility expenses. For this reason, the data subject started a campaign in the local media against the controller. The controller considered that the campaign was based on incorrect facts and offended its reputation. As a reaction, the controller called a press conference in which its manager told journalists that the data subject was suspected of committing a crime and showed them a notice of suspicion containing their name, address and personal identification number.

One of the journalists present at the press conference reported this to the Polish DPA, claiming that they became an unauthorised recipient of personal data. The Polish DPA requested clarifications from the controller who who argued that, in line with the journalistic integrity provided for in the Polish Press Law, the disclosure of information to journalists was safe. In addition, it informed that it did not notify the DPA and the data subject about the disclosure of personal as its DPO carried out a risk assessment and concluded that there were no risks for the rights of the data subject.

In light of these findings, the DPA initiated proceedings against the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves a housing association as the controller processing personal data of a data subject (name, address, personal identification number) and disclosing it to journalists during a press conference, which constitutes processing under Article 4(2) of the policy.

2. The controller disclosed personal data relating to criminal suspicions (notice of suspicion), which falls under special categories of processing under Article 10, requiring such processing to be carried out only under official authority or when authorized by law with appropriate safeguards. The controller, as a housing association, is not an official authority and did not demonstrate authorization under Union or Member State law for this disclosure.

3. The controller failed to notify the supervisory authority (Polish DPA) of the personal data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware, as required by Article 33(1), despite the unauthorized disclosure to journalists constituting a breach under Article 4(12). The controller's reliance on a DPO's risk assessment does not override this obligation.

4. The controller also failed to communicate the breach to the data subject, as required by Article 34(1), since the disclosure of criminal suspicion data likely resulted in a high risk to the data subject's rights and freedoms (e.g., reputation, privacy), and none of the exceptions in Article 34(3) apply.

5. The processing lacked a lawful basis under Article 6, as it was not necessary for any contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests (and any purported legitimate interest was overridden by the data subject's rights given the retaliatory nature of the disclosure).

6. The controller violated the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the disclosure was punitive and retaliatory rather than transparent or fair.

7. The controller's reference to ""journalistic integrity"" under Polish Press Law does not override GDPR obligations, as any national law must comply with GDPR under Article 23(1), and the disclosure was made by the controller (not a journalistic entity) to journalists, not for journalistic purposes but to discredit the data subject.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In the aftermath of the Schrems I and II judgements (C-362/14 and C-311/18), the Irish DPA started an ex office procedure into the issue of Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. (Meta Ireland) transferring personal data to Meta Platforms Inc. (Meta U.S.) in violation of Chapter V of the GDPR.

Meta Ireland had been transferring personal data to the U.S. despite the lack of a valid adequacy decision under Article 45 GDPR (as both “safe harbor” and its successor “privacy shield” were invalidated by the CJEU in Schrems I and II).

While negotiation of a new adequacy decision for EU-U.S. data transfers are ongoing, Meta Ireland claimed to have undertaken data transfers on the basis of standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission under Article 46(2)(c) GDPR even before the CJEU passed the Schrems II decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 45, Article 46, Article 49, Article 60, Article 65","1. The case involves Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. (Meta Ireland) transferring personal data to Meta Platforms Inc. (Meta U.S.), which constitutes a transfer of personal data to a third country under Chapter V of the GDPR (Article 44).

2. The policy requires that any transfer of personal data to a third country may only occur if the conditions laid down in Chapter V are complied with (Article 44), including either an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 or appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46.

3. The CJEU invalidated both the ""safe harbor"" and ""privacy shield"" adequacy decisions in Schrems I and II (C-362/14 and C-311/18), meaning there was no valid adequacy decision for transfers to the U.S. under Article 45 at the time of Meta Ireland's transfers.

4. Meta Ireland claimed to rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) adopted by the Commission under Article 46(2)(c) as appropriate safeguards for the transfers.

5. However, the policy requires that when using SCCs under Article 46, the controller or processor must ensure that data subjects have enforceable rights and effective legal remedies, and that the SCCs provide sufficient protection in the specific context of the transfer (Article 46(1) and (2)).

6. The CJEU in Schrems II determined that U.S. surveillance laws (such as Section 702 of FISA and EO 12333) do not provide sufficient protections for EU data subjects' personal data against access by U.S. public authorities, and that SCCs alone cannot overcome this deficiency without additional measures.

7. The policy states that appropriate safeguards must ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by the GDPR is not undermined (Article 44), and the Court found that Meta Ireland did not implement supplementary measures to compensate for the inadequate protection under U.S. law.

8. Furthermore, Article 49 provides for derogations for specific situations, but none applied here as the transfers were not occasional, were not based on explicit consent after being informed of risks, and did not meet the other narrow conditions listed in Article 49(1).

9. Therefore, Meta Ireland's transfers of personal data to the U.S. violated Chapter V of the GDPR, as they occurred without a valid adequacy decision and without appropriate safeguards ensuring an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed within the EU.

10. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Automobile Bavaria is a car seller (controller) suffered a data breach which resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of data of 290 data subjects. These data included names, surnames, email addresses, phone numbers, data related to their car, car purchase method and marketing options (telephone, email, newsletter registration…). Between July 2022 and 4 August 2022, due to the data breach, these data were publicly available on the controller’s website.

The controller notified the Romanian DPA of the data breach, which led the DPA to start an investigation. This investigation showed that the controller did not implement nor tested adequate security measures regarding the risk implied by the processing. It also showed that the controller did not implement adequate security measures at the time of establishing the means of the processing (privacy by design) and at the time of the processing itself (privacy by default).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves Automobile Bavaria as a data controller processing personal data (names, surnames, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.) of 290 data subjects, which falls under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller suffered a data breach where this personal data was publicly available on their website between July 2022 and 4 August 2022, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems. The investigation showed the controller failed to implement adequate security measures regarding the risks of processing.

4. Article 25(1) requires data protection by design, meaning controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures both at the time of determining the means for processing and at the time of processing itself. The investigation revealed the controller failed to implement adequate security measures at both stages.

5. Article 25(2) requires data protection by default, meaning controllers must implement measures to ensure that by default only personal data necessary for each specific purpose are processed. The investigation showed the controller failed to implement adequate default security measures.

6. The combination of these failures (inadequate security measures, lack of privacy by design and by default) directly led to the data breach and unauthorized disclosure of personal data, violating multiple GDPR requirements for ensuring the security and protection of personal data.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy requirements."
"The Finnish Meteorological Institute (the controller) used Google Analytics and reCAPTCHA services including cookies on its website. Because Google is a US-based service provider, personal data of the controller’s website visitors, such as IP address and other information that could be used to identify a data subject, were transmitted to the United States through the use of the Google services in question.

Following a website user first contacting the controller on the issue, the controller filed a data breach notification with the Finnish DPA in September 2022. According to the controller, the data breach started on 1 January 2010, and the number of data subjects affected was estimated to be 330 000. As a result, the controller disabled the Google services in question from it’s website in September 2022.

Pursuant to Article 44 GDPR, transfers of personal data to a third country can only take place if the controller and processor comply with the conditions set out in Chapter V GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 35, Article 44, Article 46","1. The Finnish Meteorological Institute (the controller) processed personal data of website visitors, including IP addresses and other identifiable information, through Google Analytics and reCAPTCHA services, which involved transferring this data to Google in the United States, a third country, without adequate safeguards (Article 4 defines personal data and processing, and Article 44 requires compliance with Chapter V for transfers to third countries).

2. Article 44 of the GDPR stipulates that any transfer of personal data to a third country must comply with the conditions in Chapter V, ensuring that the level of protection of natural persons is not undermined.

3. At the time of the transfer (from 2010 to 2022, with GDPR applicable from May 2018), the United States did not have an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45, as the Privacy Shield framework had been invalidated by the Schrems II ruling, and no new adequacy decision was in place.

4. The controller did not implement appropriate safeguards as required by Article 46, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which would have provided enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for the transfers.

5. The derogations for specific situations under Article 49 do not apply, as there was no evidence of explicit consent from data subjects for the transfer (Article 49(1)(a)), the transfer was not necessary for the performance of a contract (Article 49(1)(b)), and no other derogations like vital interests or important public interest were relevant in this context.

6. The controller's failure to ensure a lawful transfer mechanism under Chapter V constitutes a violation of Article 44, leading to an unauthorized transfer of personal data to a third country.

7. The controller filed a data breach notification with the Finnish DPA, acknowledging that the transfer occurred without proper safeguards, which aligns with the definition of a personal data breach under Article 4(12) and the notification requirement under Article 33.

8. The continuous transfer of data from 2010 to 2022, including after GDPR became applicable, means the controller was noncompliant with GDPR requirements during that period.

9. Therefore, based on the violation of Article 44 and the lack of compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The investigation found that Parkside inappropriately disclosed personal data, including special category data, of a sensitive nature in a classroom environment. There were four data subjects affected, three of whom were children.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, including special category data, by Parkside in a classroom environment, affecting four data subjects (three of whom are children), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2.

2. The processing of special category data (e.g., data revealing racial or ethnic origin, health data, etc.) is generally prohibited under Article 9(1), unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. The case does not indicate that any such exception (e.g., explicit consent, necessity for reasons of substantial public interest, etc.) was met for the processing undertaken by Parkside.

3. The inappropriate disclosure of personal data in a classroom environment likely violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the data subjects (especially children) would not reasonably expect such disclosure, and no lawful basis for this processing is evident.

4. The disclosure involving children's data raises additional concerns under Article 8, which requires specific protections for children's personal data, including obtaining parental authorization for processing in the context of information society services. While the classroom context may not directly involve information society services, the spirit of enhanced protection for children's data applies broadly under the GDPR.

5. The security of processing under Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Inappropriate disclosure in a classroom setting suggests a failure to implement such measures, especially given the sensitive nature of the data involved.

6. The violation affects multiple data subjects (four individuals, including three children), indicating a broader impact and potential systemic failure in data protection measures, contrary to the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
The Council has only responded to 260 out of 511 SARs within the statutory period of one or three months during the period of 6 April 2021 to 6 April 2022.,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15","1. The case involves the Council as a controller processing personal data and handling Subject Access Requests (SARs) from data subjects, which is governed by the GDPR as per Article 1 (subject-matter and objectives) and Article 2 (material scope).

2. Article 12(3) of the GDPR requires that the controller provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15-22 (which include SARs) without undue delay and within one month of receipt, with a possible extension of up to two additional months if necessary due to complexity or number of requests, but the controller must inform the data subject of such extension within one month of receipt.

3. The case states that during the period from 6 April 2021 to 6 April 2022, the Council received 511 SARs but only responded to 260 within the statutory period of one or three months, meaning that 251 SARs were not responded to within the required time frame.

4. This failure to respond to 251 SARs within the statutory period violates Article 12(3), as the controller did not provide the required information within the stipulated time, regardless of whether extensions were properly applied or notified.

5. Furthermore, Article 12(4) stipulates that if the controller does not take action on a request, it must inform the data subject without delay and at latest within one month of the reasons for not taking action and the possibilities for complaint and judicial remedy. The case implies that for the 251 unresponsive SARs, the Council likely failed to provide such information, constituting an additional violation of Article 12(4).

6. Therefore, based on the GDPR provisions, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"For SARs that have been completed within the statutory one month deadline by the council, the highest compliance rate over the last three years is 45% for the year of 2021/2022. For SARs completed within a 90 day period the highest compliance rate is 77% for the year 2022/2023; however, at the time of writing, this compliance rate was correct as of 29 September 2022.

In total, 18 SARs took up to two years to complete and there are eight SARs up to two years old which have still not been completed. A further 18 SARs then took between three months and one year for completion. As of 31 January 2023, there are still 20 SARs which are up to one year old that have not been completed yet.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15","1. The case involves a data controller (the council) processing Subject Access Requests (SARs) from data subjects, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as the council is a public authority processing personal data.

2. Article 12(3) requires controllers to provide information on action taken regarding SARs (under Articles 15-22) without undue delay and within one month of receipt, extendable by two further months where necessary based on complexity. The case shows the council taking up to two years to complete some SARs, far exceeding the maximum permitted timeframe of three months.

3. Article 15 establishes the data subject's right to access their personal data, which must be facilitated by the controller under Article 12(2). The council's low compliance rates (45% within one month, 77% within 90 days) and significant backlog (20 SARs up to one year old still incomplete) demonstrate systematic failure to facilitate this right.

4. The excessive delays in responding to SARs violate the principle of lawful, fair, and transparent processing under Article 5(1)(a), as data subjects cannot exercise their rights in a timely manner.

5. The council's failure to respond within statutory timeframes constitutes a violation of both the specific procedural requirements of Article 12 and the substantive right of access under Article 15, particularly given the substantial number of overdue requests spanning multiple years.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy requirements for responding to Subject Access Requests."
"Confidential waste documents were left in an unsecured prison holding area. Prisoners and staff had access to the 14 bags of confidential documents, which included medical and security vetting details, for a period of 18 days.

During this time staff challenged prisoners who were openly reading the documents, but did nothing proactive to ensure the personal information was secured. At least 44 people had access to the information, which had remained on site as a contracted shredder waste removal company had not collected as scheduled.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, specifically medical and security vetting details, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 4 (definitions of 'personal data' and 'processing') and Article 2 (material scope), as the processing was carried out by a controller (the prison authority) and involves automated or structured filing systems.

2. The personal data left unsecured includes special categories of data under Article 9(1), such as medical data (health information) and possibly data relating to criminal convictions (security vetting details), which require higher protection under the Regulation.

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. The failure to secure the 14 bags of confidential documents in a prison holding area, where prisoners and staff had access for 18 days, violates this principle.

4. Article 32 mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing. The sensitive nature of the data (medical and security details) and the environment (prison with potential malicious actors) heighten the risk, yet no adequate measures were taken to prevent unauthorized access, as the documents were left unsecured and the shredding contractor failed to collect them as scheduled.

5. Despite staff challenging prisoners who were reading the documents, they took no proactive steps to secure the information, indicating a failure in organizational measures and staff training under Article 32, which requires ensuring the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of processing systems and services.

6. The incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it involves the accidental destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Article 33 requires that the controller notify the supervisory authority of a breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The case does not mention notification, but the breach was known to staff for 18 days without resolution, suggesting a failure to report or address it promptly.

7. Article 34 requires communication of the breach to data subjects when it is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The exposure of medical and security vetting details to prisoners and staff creates such a risk, yet no communication is noted, indicating noncompliance.

8. The controller (prison authority) failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2), as they did not implement measures to ensure and prove compliance, such as securing the documents or managing the contractor effectively, leading to unauthorized access by at least 44 individuals.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 32, 33, and 34, among others, by failing to protect personal data against unauthorized access, not reporting the breach, and not communicating it to data subjects where required."
"A data subject realised that their neighbour (controller) installed surveillance cameras that were monitoring their private garden. They considered that the monitoring was violating the Spanish data protection law (Art.22 LOPDGDD) in force.

The data subject therefore filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5","1. The case involves a data subject and a controller (the neighbor) as per the GDPR policy definitions in Article 4, where the controller processes personal data through surveillance cameras monitoring the private garden.

2. The processing of personal data must have a lawful basis under Article 6(1) of the GDPR. The controller's surveillance does not appear to have the data subject's consent, and it is not necessary for a contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests that override the data subject's rights, as required by Article 6(1)(a)-(f).

3. Specifically, for legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f), the controller must demonstrate that their interests are not overridden by the data subject's fundamental rights. Monitoring a private garden is highly intrusive and likely violates the data subject's privacy rights, failing this balance.

4. Under Article 13 of the GDPR, the controller must provide the data subject with information about the processing at the time data is collected, including the controller's identity, purposes, legal basis, and other details. The case implies that the data subject was not informed, as they discovered the monitoring and filed a complaint, indicating a violation of Article 13.

5. The principles of processing under Article 5(1)(a) require that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. The covert surveillance without notification fails to meet these principles, as it is not lawful or transparent.

6. The Spanish data protection law (Art. 22 LOPDGDD) mentioned in the case aligns with GDPR requirements for video surveillance, and its violation further confirms noncompliance with GDPR standards, as member state laws must adhere to GDPR provisions.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy due to the lack of a lawful basis for processing and failure to provide required information to the data subject."
"In February 2021, the Italian Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) informed the Italian DPA that two related companies, MAS S.R.L. and MAS S.R.L.S., were engaging in door-to-door marketing and ilegally using personal data to promote and offer contracts with electric companies.

Initially, the DPA opened an investigation only against the two companies. However, the investigations revealed a complex system of direct and indirect contractual relationships, with two companies in the energy sector as final recipients of said marketing services: HERA COMM and ENEL ENERGIA.

Operating as part of that system, MAS S.R.L.S. first bought personal data bases from an Italian and a Spanish company and also from an unidentified vendor on Facebook. Then, together with MAS S.R.L., it processed these data for door-to-door marketing on behalf of the electric companies, without telling consumers that they were mere intermediaries. Additionally, the companies did not tell them how they collected their personal data.

Moreover, MAS S.R.L. and MAS S.R.L.S. shared the collected personal data with telemarketing companies SESTA IMPRESA and ARNIA, that further processed the data for telephone advertising. During the investigation, no proof of consumer consent was provided.

The DPA also found that SESTA IMPRESA got the credentials to access ENEL's infromation systems and shared them with ARNIA. In turn, ARNIA used these credentials to upload the signed contracts into the system without authorization from ENEL. None of the telemarketing companies had a written contract with ENEL appointing them as processors.

Although ARNIA had been appointed as a processor by SESTA in 2019, none of the other companies had signed data processing  or joint controllership agreements. They were also not appointed as processors or sub-processors by other intermediaries nor by the final customers HERA COMM and ENEL.

The DPA also verified that the marketing activities involved a large number of consumers as ARNIA uploaded 260.000 contracts between 2018 and 2022.  While ARNIA presented a purely procedural defense, the other investigated companies decided to not defend themselves at all.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 13, Article 28, Article 29, Article 30, Article 32","1. The case involves multiple companies (MAS S.R.L., MAS S.R.L.S., SESTA IMPRESA, ARNIA, HERA COMM, and ENEL ENERGIA) processing personal data for marketing purposes, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing involves automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The processing of personal data for marketing purposes requires a lawful basis under Article 6, such as consent. However, no proof of consumer consent was provided during the investigation, violating the requirement for lawful processing under Article 6(1)(a).

3. The companies failed to provide transparent information to data subjects about the collection and use of their personal data, as required by Article 13 and Article 14. Specifically, they did not inform consumers about how their data was collected or that MAS S.R.L. and MAS S.R.L.S. were intermediaries, violating the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

4. The companies engaged in the processing of personal data without establishing proper contractual relationships. Article 28 requires that processing by a processor on behalf of a controller be governed by a contract or legal act. However, no written contracts were in place between ENEL and the telemarketing companies (SESTA IMPRESA and ARNIA) appointing them as processors, which is a direct violation of Article 28(3).

5. ARNIA accessed ENEL's information systems using credentials obtained without authorization and uploaded contracts without ENEL's consent. This violates the security requirements under Article 32, which mandate appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing, including preventing unauthorized access.

6. The sharing of personal data between companies (e.g., MAS S.R.L. and MAS S.R.L.S. sharing data with SESTA IMPRESA and ARNIA) occurred without the necessary data processing agreements or joint controllership arrangements as required by Article 26 and Article 28, leading to a lack of accountability and control over the data processing activities.

7. The scale of processing, involving 260,000 contracts, indicates large-scale processing without adequate safeguards, violating the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) and the requirement for data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

8. The companies involved did not cooperate effectively with the investigation, with some presenting only procedural defenses and others not defending themselves at all, which undermines the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the obligation to demonstrate compliance.

9. The overall processing activities, including the purchase of data from unidentified vendors on Facebook and the lack of transparency, contractual agreements, and security measures, result in multiple infringements of the GDPR, including Articles 5, 6, 13, 14, 25, 26, 28, and 32.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Capitol's Emergency Service in Denmark (Hovedstadens Beredskab I/S) (the controller) reported a data breach to the Danish DPA after become aware of wide accessibility to HR data.

The data breach was reported after the controller became aware of the fact that its new electronic case & document management (ESDH) system allowed all employees to access of current and former employees' personal data. The data consisted the full names, social security numbers, and addresses, including protected addresses, of over 2000 persons. After a closer investigation, the controller stated that 6 users, who have accessed information about current or former employees, did not have a work-related need to access the information.

It appears from the controller's statement, that the controller, and the supplier of the ESDH system, both, were allegedly unaware of the fact that this information was accessible to all employees.

Following the reported data breach, the supplier started to plan for a solution, where it is possible, to ensure that only authorised users can search access the personal data in the ESDH system. Moreveover, the controller started conducting an analysis of how many and which types of users have a work-related need for access to the relevant information about current and former employees.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a controller (Hovedstadens Beredskab I/S) processing personal data of current and former employees, including sensitive information like social security numbers and protected addresses, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definition of personal data).

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), since the ESDH system allowed all employees to access sensitive personal data without proper access controls.

3. The controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised access, as evidenced by 6 users accessing information without a work-related need.

4. The controller did not demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they were allegedly unaware of the accessibility issues in their system, indicating insufficient oversight and implementation of data protection measures.

5. The processing of special categories of personal data (such as social security numbers) requires enhanced protections under Article 9, but the controller failed to implement appropriate safeguards for such sensitive data, exacerbating the severity of the breach.

6. The controller's failure to conduct a proper data protection impact assessment under Article 35, given the high-risk nature of processing sensitive HR data, contributed to the undetected vulnerability in the system.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of the GDPR's security, accountability, and data protection principles."
"Following a report by a trade union about video surveillance in multiple companies, in April 2022, the Italian Garante launched an investigation with the company H&M (controller) concerning the video surveillance systems in place at their registered office and in their stores.

The investigation service raised multiple points, among others

* that all the controller’s shops were equipped with surveillance cameras;
* the video surveillance system was active 24 hours a day and that images were kept for 24 hours;
* in some of the shops, cameras were placed at employees’ entrance and in other areas reserved to the employees; and
* the processing concerned more than 500 employees.

The controller argued that the employees were informed of the presence of the cameras through information notices. It relied on a security and protection purpose and referred to an authorization of processing that would have been issued by a territorial Labor Inspectorate.

The controller also stated that only 543 employees out of a total of 4,300 were actually monitored and that the cameras were only monitoring an area of passage.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 88","1. The case involves H&M as a data controller processing personal data of employees through video surveillance, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller relied on security purposes as the legal basis for processing under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests). However, constant 24/7 surveillance in employee-only areas goes beyond what is necessary for security purposes and likely violates the principle of proportionality and data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), which requires data processing to be limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes.

3. The processing involves monitoring in areas reserved for employees, which could capture special categories of personal data (e.g., health information, union activities) under Article 9(1). The controller did not demonstrate that any of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applied, such as explicit consent or necessity for reasons of substantial public interest, making this processing unlawful.

4. The controller claimed employees were informed through notices, but for processing to be lawful under Article 13, information must be provided in a transparent manner including the purposes and legal basis. The 24/7 nature of surveillance and placement in private areas likely wasn't adequately explained, violating transparency requirements.

5. The scale of processing (500+ employees) and the intrusive nature of surveillance in employee-only areas would require a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(1), as it likely presents a high risk to rights and freedoms. No evidence of such assessment was presented.

6. For processing in the employment context, Member States may introduce more specific rules under Article 88. Italy requires authorization from the labor inspectorate or trade unions for such surveillance, which the controller claimed to have but didn't substantiate adequately.

7. The storage of images for 24 hours without justification appears to violate the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary.

8. Therefore, considering the violations of multiple GDPR principles (Articles 5, 6, 9, 13, 35) and lack of proper authorization under national employment data protection rules, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Background

Following a complaint filed by noyb, in January 2019, as well as, complaints from the Netherlands and Denmark against Spotify AB (Spotify) regarding the right of access under Article 15 GDPR, the Swedish DPA initiated an ex officio investigation on whether Spotify’s general practices for handling access requests comply with the GDPR.

After 3 years of inactivity from the DPA, noyb sought remedy under Article 78(2) GDPR from the Stockholm Administrative Court, which eventually sided with noyb. As a result, the DPA has now finally issued a decision on noyb’s complaint, as well as, the other complaints filed against Spotify simultaneously with the DPA’s ex officio investigation. Since Spotify operates in several EU Member States, the DPA applied the cooperation and consistency mechanisms set out in Chapter VII GDPR.

The complaint brought by noyb was identified as ‘complaint 2’, and the complaint from the Netherlands as ‘complaint 1’. The complaint from Denmark was eventually rejected, because the investigation of the case did not show that Spotify has failed in its handling of the complainant's request for access.

Facts on Spotify’s general procedures for handling access requests (ex officio investigation)

With regard to Spotify's general practices on handling access requests, Spotify provides information required by Article 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) GDPR via an online function. When Spotify provides a copy of personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR it includes a file called ""Read me first"" to each copy of data with a link to the information.

Moreover, Spotify provides a copy of personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR by dividing the information to three different layers: “Type 1” that consists profile information, “Type 2” that consists technical log files linked to the data subjects' user IDs and “Type3” that consists information specifically requested by a data subject. Spotify provides the information in JSON format.

Facts on individual complaints that triggered the DPA’s ex officio investigation

Complaint 1

The complainant had made an access request, on 27 May 2018, under Article 15 GDPR to Spotify, and contacted Spotify later again, as the complainant themself noticed that the information provided by Spotify was incomplete. Spotify thereafter provided the remaining data. The data was provided to the complainant in JSON format. Some of the technical log files were provided encrypted which Spotify, during the DPA's investigation, claimed to have been a mistake.

The complainant argued that 1) Spotify did not provide the personal data in due time under Article 12(3) GDPR and 2) that the data was not provided in an intelligible form as required by Article 12(1) GDPR.

Complaint 2

The complainant made an access request, on 10 Oct 2018, under Article 15 GDPR to Spotify by using Spotify's ""Download your data"" feature that provided the ""Type 1"" information. The ""Type 1"" data was provided to the complainant in JSON format. The complainant did not return to Spotify for further information.

It was argued by the complainant that 1) Spotify had not provided all of the personal data that Spotify processes about them, 2) Spotify had not provided any of the information as required by Article 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) GDPR, and that 3) Spotify had not provided the personal data in an intelligible form as required by Article 12(1) GDPR. At the time of the complainant’s request, Spotify had not yet implemented its practice - mentioned above - where Spotify includes the “Read me first” file to its responses to access requests. Such information was available only in Spotify’s privacy policy, at the time.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 60","1. The case involves Spotify AB as a data controller processing personal data of users, making it subject to the GDPR regulations as outlined in Article 1 and Article 2.

2. Under Article 12(1), the controller must provide information relating to processing ""in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language."" Spotify provided personal data in JSON format, which is a machine-readable format not easily intelligible to data subjects without technical tools, violating this requirement.

3. Article 15(1) requires the controller to provide specific information including purposes of processing, categories of personal data, recipients, and other details. At the time of Complaint 2, Spotify failed to provide this information directly with the data access response, instead relying on their privacy policy, which does not fulfill the specific disclosure requirements of Article 15.

4. Article 12(3) requires controllers to provide information on action taken regarding access requests ""without undue delay and in any event within one month."" In Complaint 1, the complainant had to contact Spotify again to obtain complete information, indicating Spotify failed to provide all required data within the statutory timeframe.

5. Article 15(3) requires controllers to provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. While Spotify provided data in three types, the JSON format used does not constitute a ""commonly used electronic form"" that is readily accessible and intelligible to the average data subject, as required by the same article.

6. The combination of these violations - failure to provide information in an intelligible form (Article 12), failure to provide all required information under Article 15, and failure to respond completely within the required timeframe (Article 12) - demonstrates systematic noncompliance with GDPR access request requirements.

7. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A data subject submitted a complaint to the Romanian DPA claiming that the data controller sends her unsolicited SMS messages, although she has repeatedly exercised her right to deletion, according to the GDPR.  Following such, the Romanian DPA started and investigation.  During such, the Romanian DPA sent a request of information to the data controller. The data controller did not respond to the authority's request.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 83,"1. The case involves a data subject who received unsolicited SMS messages from a data controller, which constitutes processing for direct marketing purposes as defined under the GDPR (Article 21(2)).
2. The data subject exercised her right to object to direct marketing under Article 21(2) and her right to erasure under Article 17 of the GDPR, which requires the controller to cease processing and erase personal data if grounds such as objection or withdrawal of consent apply.
3. The data controller continued to send SMS messages despite the data subject's objections, violating Article 21(3) (which mandates that processing must stop upon objection for direct marketing) and potentially Article 17 (right to erasure).
4. The Romanian DPA, as a supervisory authority under Article 51, initiated an investigation into the complaint and exercised its power under Article 58(1)(a) to request information from the data controller.
5. Article 31 of the GDPR requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request, but the data controller failed to respond to the DPA's request, violating this obligation.
6. The data controller's failure to respond also impedes the DPA's ability to perform its tasks under Article 57, such as monitoring and enforcing GDPR compliance.
7. Therefore, the data controller is noncompliant with multiple GDPR provisions, including Articles 17, 21, and 31.
8. Thus, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"After procedure 7.2020, in which a decision established a deadline for TIM, as the controller, to implement a series of corrective measures, the Italian DPA received several complaints relating to issues already subject to the aforementioned decision. These complaints referred mainly to the following:

1) unsolicited advertising telephone calls, text messages and emails (often repetitive);

2) missed or late response to access requests;

3) publication of personal numbers in telephone directories;

4) unavailability of privacy information during the purchases on the controller's website;

5) a possible data breach.

The Italian DPA grouped together the complaints of a similar and repeated nature and opened a wide investigation against the controller.

1) As for the unsolicited phone calls, the controller denied that data subjects were contacted by its ""commercially active sales force"" and stated that it did not recognize the calling numbers. It also claimed that, before using personal data obtained from external providers, it verifies that data subjects gave their consent by carrying out a test on a random sample of names included in the database. According to the controller, the data from data subjects who appear to have denied their consent  for marketing activities are deleted.

2) With regard to personal data access requests, the controller presented different justifications. In some cases, it claimed to be unaware of the access request or that it was not possible to authenticate the user. In others, it admitted not having answered them or having answered them only partially. About the requests relating to unwanted calls, it claimed that it did not provide more information because it did not recognize the calling numbers as its own numbers.

3) Similarly, the controller presented several arguments in relation to telephone directories. In general, it stated that its customers received a copy of the contractual conditions in which they consented to the publication of their personal data in telephone directories. However, it recognized that there was a misalignment between its systems, which hindered the processing of consent withdrawals. In this regard, the controller informed that the anomaly was resolved and that confidentiality requests are being adequately addressed. In other specific cases, it argued that the the responsability was exclusively on the publisher of the public directories.

4) Concerning the complaints on the unavailability of the privacy information, the controller once again attributed the fact to a temporary anomaly in the system. This anomaly - TIM said - was already resolved and customers could then access the privacy policy before the conclusionof online purchases, expressing their consent for purposes other than the performance of the contract.

5) Finally, with reference to the data breach, the controller alleged that it received no reports or comlplaints on the matter. However, from the checks carried out on its commercial systems, it emerged that some data subjects were associated with the tax code other persons and mistakenly received communications containing their personal data such as name, surname, tax code and telephone number.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 14, Article 15, Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves TIM as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 4(7) defining a controller, and Article 3 establishing territorial scope since TIM operates in the EU.

2. Regarding unsolicited marketing communications (calls, texts, emails), TIM failed to demonstrate valid consent as required by Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7. The controller's reliance on random sample verification rather than ensuring consent for all individuals violates the principle of lawfulness and the requirement that consent must be specific and verifiable.

3. For access requests under Article 15, TIM's failures to respond, partial responses, and authentication issues violate Article 12(2) which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, and Article 15(1) which mandates providing access without undue delay.

4. Concerning telephone directory publications, TIM's system misalignment that hindered consent withdrawals violates Article 7(3) regarding the right to withdraw consent, and Article 21 regarding the right to object. The controller's attempt to shift responsibility to directory publishers does not absolve its obligations as controller under Article 24.

5. The unavailability of privacy information during online purchases violates Article 13(1) which requires providing information at the time of data collection, and Article 7(2) regarding clear consent mechanisms. Even if temporary, such system anomalies represent failures in data protection by design under Article 25.

6. The data breach involving incorrect association of tax codes and disclosure of personal data to wrong recipients violates Article 5(1)(f) regarding integrity and confidentiality, Article 32 regarding security of processing, and Article 33 regarding breach notification requirements.

7. TIM's pattern of multiple violations across different processing activities demonstrates a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures as required by Article 24(1) and Article 32(1), and violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

8. The controller's responses show insufficient remedial actions and continued non-compliance despite previous corrective measures ordered by the DPA, violating Article 58(2) regarding compliance with supervisory authority decisions.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Controller is the operator of a platform for short-term car rental: “CityBee”. It was made aware by another company that provides cyber-security services, that CityBee’s customer data of 110,302 users was published on the website RaidForums.com. The controller notified the DPA, who conducted an investigation.

The DPA found out that the personal data was retrieved from an unprotected database backup BACPAC file (DB file), and contained the following: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, personal identification number, driving license number, type of payment card and the last four digits of the number, the expiration date of the payment card, and the user identifier (token) in Braintree (software for online payments). This DB file was created on 27 February 2018, and access to the file was suspended on 16 February 2021. Hence, the DPA concluded that the personal data breach existed for this entire period.

The DPA found that a number of organisational and technical security measures were missing: there was no competent person responsible for security and risk management, no logs were kept of access and changes to the DB files, the DB file was stored unencrypted, the passwords in the DB file had a weak encryption (SHA-1) and easy to retrieve by persons with technical knowledge, and users could make passwords that did not comply with the requirements as set out in the company’s IT security policy. Lastly, the controller did not assess and manage the risks associated with the loss of the DB file, since it was not even aware of the existence of this DB in the first place (!).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 83","1. The case involves a controller (CityBee) processing personal data of 110,302 users, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically:
   - The database backup file was stored unencrypted
   - Passwords used weak encryption (SHA-1) that was easily retrievable
   - No access logs were maintained for the database files
   - No competent person was responsible for security and risk management
   - Password requirements in the IT security policy were not enforced

3. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the principle of accountability under Article 5(2), as they were not aware of the existence of the database backup file and therefore could not demonstrate that appropriate security measures were implemented.

4. The controller failed to implement data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, as evidenced by:
   - The lack of pseudonymisation or encryption of personal data in the backup file
   - The excessive amount of personal data collected and stored beyond what was necessary
   - The extended storage period of the backup file (from February 2018 to February 2021)

5. The personal data breach involved special categories of data (personal identification numbers) and financial data (payment card information), which require higher protection standards under Articles 9 and 32, but the controller failed to provide appropriate safeguards for this sensitive data.

6. The controller failed to conduct a proper data protection impact assessment under Article 35, as the risks associated with storing such extensive personal data in an unprotected backup file were not identified or managed.

7. The duration of the breach (approximately three years) demonstrates a systematic failure in the controller's security measures and monitoring procedures, violating the ongoing security obligation under Article 32(1)(d) to regularly test, assess and evaluate the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy as the controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of processing as required by multiple articles of the Regulation, particularly Articles 5, 25, 32, and 35."
"The Lithuanian DPA ('VDAI') received a complaint stating that in order to use the services of a sports club (UAB VS FITNESS), fingerprint scanning is required. It then initiated an own volition investigation of a possible breach of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 13, Article 30, Article 35","1. The case involves the processing of biometric data (fingerprint scanning) by a sports club (UAB VS FITNESS), which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

2. Fingerprint data constitutes biometric data under Article 4(14) and falls under special categories of personal data according to Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless specific conditions apply.

3. The sports club processed this sensitive data without demonstrating compliance with any of the exceptions in Article 9(2), particularly since:
   - Consent under Article 9(2)(a) was not freely given due to the imbalance of power between the controller and data subjects (members requiring service access)
   - No other applicable exceptions under Article 9(2) (such as substantial public interest or vital interests) were established

4. The processing violated the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), as the sports club could not demonstrate that fingerprint scanning was necessary for access control when less intrusive alternatives existed.

5. The controller failed to conduct a proper Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35, given the high-risk processing of special category biometric data on a large scale.

6. The Lithuanian DPA (VDAI), acting under its investigative powers per Article 58(1), determined the processing violated multiple GDPR principles and provisions following its investigation.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 1st October 2020, an article published on a French media website revealed the existence of a personal data breach concerning the data stored on KG COM's (controller) server. The controller operates several websites to offer its customers clairvoyance readings by chat or phone.

According to this article, the controller’s database was not subject to special security measures and it was freely accessible on the internet until 23rd July 2020. The data exposed included the identification data and contact data of prospective and actual customers (data subjects).

Following the publication of the article, the French DPA (CNIL) carried out three investigations into the controller’s practices.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 28, Article 32, Article 33, Article 82","1. The case involves KG COM as a data controller processing personal data of customers and prospective customers, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, since the processing is carried out by automated means.

2. The controller's database containing identification and contact data was freely accessible on the internet until 23rd July 2020, indicating a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) of the GDPR.

3. The personal data breach involving unauthorized access to personal data was not properly secured, which constitutes a violation of the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f), requiring personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security.

4. The controller failed to notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as required by Article 33(1), since the breach was only revealed through a media article on 1st October 2020, long after the breach was accessible until 23rd July 2020.

5. The controller did not communicate the personal data breach to the data subjects without undue delay when the breach was likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms, as required by Article 34(1), given that identification and contact data were exposed.

6. The controller failed to document the personal data breach, including the facts, effects, and remedial actions taken, as required by Article 33(5), which is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the notification obligations.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1), 33(1), 33(5), and 34(1) of the GDPR."
"After numerous press reports, the Italian DPA learned that some cemeteries in Rome had a specific area for 'products of conception' and 'fetuses' that were buried in small graves over which the names of women who had had abortions were affixed on a cross. Differently from other areas of the cemeteries, where fetuses were buried after a cerimony, in this specific areas the burials were made at the request of the local health agency and did not receive a funeral. 

The Italian DPA then opened a wide investigation that was divided in 3 procedures: one against the local health agency (ASL), one against the public company that managed the cemeteries (AMA) and one against the City of Rome (owner of the public company). In the course of the investigations, the DPA found that  AMA had signed a service contract with the City of Rome, through which it was identified as the processor, pursuant to Article 28 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 29, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, specifically the names of women who had abortions, which is considered personal data related to health under Article 4(1) and falls under special categories of personal data as defined in Article 9(1) GDPR.

2. Processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited under Article 9(1) unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) is met. The display of names on crosses in a public cemetery lacks a lawful basis such as explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) or necessity for reasons of public interest in public health (Article 9(2)(i)), and the processing is not proportionate or necessary, thus violating Article 9.

3. The principles of data processing under Article 5 are violated, including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), as the women were not informed about the processing of their personal data for this purpose, and the public display is not fair or transparent.

4. The City of Rome, as the controller under Article 4(7), is responsible for ensuring compliance with GDPR principles under the accountability principle (Article 5(2)), but it failed to implement appropriate measures to protect the personal data, including data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)).

5. AMA, identified as the processor under Article 28, must act only on documented instructions from the controller (Article 28(3)). However, the processing (displaying names) likely exceeded any lawful instructions, and AMA failed to ensure appropriate security measures as required by Article 32, leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

6. The processing also violates Article 6, which requires a lawful basis for processing, such as consent or legitimate interests, but no such basis is evident here, especially given the sensitive nature of the data.

7. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 5, 6, 9, 28, and 32, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A ""ShareArt"" project was implemented in the Municipal Art Collections of Palazzo D'Accursio in Bologna in order to obtain information on the characteristics of the visitors and on the ways in which they interacted with some works of art. The project followed a collaboration agreement between ENEA and the Bologna Museums Institution which is an instrumental body of the Municipality of Bologna (the “Municipality”).

The information was collected with a system using a face detection algorithm (“ShareArt”) developed by the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (“ENEA”). The face detection algorithm was based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect faces in the images. Visitors were informed about the system with a notice at the ticket office that stated, inter alia, that the algorithm ""does not imply face recognition”.

An Italian civil rights organisation (Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights) submitted a report to the Italian DPA in relation to the used ShareArt system. The report stated, inter alia, that ShareArt, using a camera, automatically detected faces looking in the direction of art work, contextually acquiring a series of information relating to behaviour when observing works of art. The report highlighted that only very few signs were in place to indicate to the museum visitors that the system was used: small black cameras attached to the walls and a disclaimer at the ticket office.

Following the report, the DPA launched an investigation and requested for information from the Municipality as well as ENEA. The parties argued, inter alia, that the system does not involve the collection and processing of data relating to identified or identifiable natural persons. Moreover, the Municipality viewed that it did not have any kind of role with regard to the data processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 26","1. The case involves the processing of biometric data through the ShareArt system's face detection algorithm, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4 of the policy, as it relates to identifiable natural persons (visitors) through facial features.

2. The processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying natural persons falls under special categories of personal data according to Article 9(1), which prohibits such processing unless specific conditions under Article 9(2) are met.

3. The Municipality and ENEA failed to obtain explicit consent from data subjects as required by Article 9(2)(a) for processing special category data, as visitors were only informed through a notice at the ticket office without any mechanism for affirmative consent.

4. The information provided to visitors was insufficient under Articles 13 and 14, which mandate transparent communication about processing purposes, legal basis, and data subjects' rights. The small cameras and limited notice did not meet the requirements for clear and accessible information.

5. The Municipality, as the museum operator, qualifies as a data controller under Article 4(7) since it determines the purposes and means of processing, but it incorrectly denied any role in the processing, violating the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

6. The system's use of facial detection without proper safeguards violates Article 35, which requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment for high-risk processing, including systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale.

7. The lack of appropriate technical measures to ensure data minimization and privacy by design, as required by Articles 25 and 32, further demonstrates noncompliance, as the system collected more data than necessary for its stated purpose.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of GDPR provisions, including unlawful processing of special category data, insufficient transparency, failure to conduct a DPIA, and disregard for data protection principles."
he responsible party or processor used Cloudflare to secure the website for the Census2022.,NONCOMPLIANT,Article 58,"1. The case involves the use of Cloudflare to secure the website for Census2022, which constitutes processing of personal data (as defined in Article 4) by a third-party service provider (Cloudflare) on behalf of the controller (the organization responsible for Census2022).

2. Under Article 28(3), processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or other legal act that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller, setting out specific requirements including that the processor processes personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, ensures security of processing, and assists the controller in fulfilling its obligations under the GDPR.

3. The case does not provide any information indicating that such a contract exists between the controller and Cloudflare, or that the contract includes the mandatory provisions required by Article 28(3). This constitutes a violation of the GDPR's processor requirements.

4. Additionally, under Article 32, the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. While using Cloudflare may provide security benefits, the controller remains responsible for ensuring that all processing (including by processors) meets GDPR security standards.

5. The case involves a census, which likely involves processing of special categories of data (as defined in Article 9) on a large scale, requiring additional safeguards under Articles 9 and 35. The use of a third-party processor without proper contractual arrangements and oversight exacerbates the risks associated with such processing.

6. Furthermore, if Cloudflare processes data outside the EU/EEA, the transfer would need to comply with Chapter V of the GDPR (Articles 44-49), requiring appropriate safeguards such as adequacy decisions, standard contractual clauses, or binding corporate rules. The case provides no information about such safeguards.

7. Therefore, based on the lack of demonstrated compliance with processor requirements (Article 28), security obligations (Article 32), and potential international transfer rules (Chapter V), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"Several Danish citizens had discovered that by logging into their online bank via MitID - a digital identity solution - they gained access to other citizens' accounts. Three different banks that were using the MitID solution within their online banking services each reported a data security breach to the Danish DPA.

Following the reports from the banks, the Danish DPA initiated an investigation on the matter.

The MitID solution is owned in a joint partnership between the financial sector and the public sector, specifically the Digitalisation Agency. The Digitalisation Agency is the data controller for the processing of personal data in MitID.

When the 'MitID' solution is used and it has verified that the user who wants to log in to a service is who they claim to be, an authentication response is generated which is then sent to a broker (the company that conveys the authentication response - in this case the Signaturgruppen, the data controller for the broker solution). The broker forwards the information to the service provider whose service the user wishes to access (which in this case were the banks in question).

According to the Digitalisation Agency, the error was found to be due to the fact that login requests to the same online bank within milliseconds could in special cause MitID to issue a token for another session. This error could have been avoided if the broker (Signaturgruppen) had validated the citizens' login with a technology called ”Broker Security Context”. The Digitalisation Agency had recommended to the brokers implementing the solution to perform the Broker Security Context, but had not made it a requirement.

Signaturgruppen were recommended by the The Digital Agency to perform validation of the tokens that are generated in connection to the log in requests which the brokers receive from MitID. Nevertheless, Signaturgruppen had used the Broker Security Context in a different way than what was described in the recommendation.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the Digitalisation Agency as the data controller for the MitID solution, which processes personal data for authentication purposes, falling under the scope of GDPR as per Article 4 (definitions of 'controller' and 'processing') and Article 2 (material scope).

2. The security breach resulted in unauthorized access to citizens' bank accounts, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access.

3. The Digitalisation Agency, as controller, failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, it did not mandate the use of Broker Security Context validation despite being aware of its necessity, which could have prevented the token issuance error.

4. The controller also violated Article 24(1) on accountability, as it did not demonstrate compliance by failing to enforce necessary safeguards (e.g., making Broker Security Context a requirement rather than a recommendation), considering the nature, scope, and context of the processing.

5. The broker, Signaturgruppen (a processor), implemented the security measure incorrectly, but the Digitalisation Agency, as controller, remained responsible under Article 28(1) for ensuring processors provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate measures, which it failed to do.

6. The incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12) due to unauthorized access, and while the banks reported it, the root cause lies in the controller's inadequate security measures and oversight of the processor.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 24(1), 28(1), and 32(1)."
"A registered user of an email service (the data subject) requested their data from the email service provider (the controller) in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format pursuant to Article 20 GDPR. The controller denied the request, stating that the data subject could export their emails one by one in an '.eml format'. Furthermore, the controller argued that it is still uncertain whether Article 20 GDPR applies to emails. The controller stated to be in the process of developing an import/export -tool. The tool was not yet available to all users, at the time. The data subject requested the Finnish DPA to investigate whether the controller had fulfilled its obligations under Article 20 GDPR.

The DPA requested an explanation from the controller aiming to understand how the controller facilitated the right to data portability in relation to the email service. Furthermore, the DPA sought to determine whether the controller treated this right differently based on whether the user paid for the service or not.

According to the controller, their intention was to provide data import and export tools for all users. However, due to technical reasons, such as encryption technologies, users had to perform these tasks manually themselves. The controller said to have been working on an automated tool to facilitate mass data export. However, they explained that they were unable to offer it to the entire user base due to technical and development-related challenges. Initially, access to the tool was limited to users with a subscription as a beta version, allowing for testing its stability and functionality on a progressively larger scale.

Following the DPA's request, the tool was made available to free plan customers as well. The version released to them was the same one that had been available to paid customers for over a year.

The data subject argued that the controller intentionally delayed fulfilling its obligations under the GDPR until an investigation by the supervisory authority would be initiated. In the meantime, controller had been generating revenue by charging users for the implementation of rights guaranteed by the GDPR, resulting in financial gain for at least two years.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 20","1. The case involves a data subject (registered user) exercising their right to data portability under Article 20 GDPR by requesting their personal data from the controller (email service provider) in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.

2. The controller failed to fulfill this obligation by initially only offering manual export of individual emails in .eml format, which does not constitute providing the data in a manner that facilitates transmission to another controller as required by Article 20(1) and (2).

3. The controller's development of an automated tool but limiting its availability initially only to paying subscribers created an unjustified differential treatment between users based on payment status, contrary to Article 12(1) and (5) which require controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights without charge (unless requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive).

4. The controller's delay in making the tool available to all users (free and paid) for over a year while continuing to generate revenue from paid access to functionality implementing GDPR rights violates the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) and constitutes a failure to implement appropriate technical measures to facilitate data portability as required by Article 24(1).

5. The controller's actions effectively made the exercise of GDPR rights conditional on payment for a significant period, which is prohibited under Article 12(5) and contradicts the fundamental right to data portability under Article 20.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR provisions on data portability (Article 20), facilitation of data subject rights (Article 12), and general principles of fair processing (Article 5)."
"Farmacia Ardealul (controller) is a pharmacy that also operates a website for the online sale of its products.

The controller was victim of a malware attack where an unauthorised program was installed on the company's website and thus a fictious form for collecting bank data was displayed to custom-ers when purchasing goods online. This situation led to the breach of confidentiality of personal data (bank data) of a significant number of customers.

The company notified the data breach to the DPA, which then opened an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. Farmacia Ardealul is a controller processing personal data (bank data of customers) through its online sales website, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means.

2. Under Article 32 of the GDPR, controllers must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure of personal data.

3. The malware attack that installed an unauthorized program on the website, leading to a fake form collecting bank data, constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4, as it resulted in unauthorized access to personal data.

4. The occurrence of this breach indicates a failure by Farmacia Ardealul to implement adequate security measures, such as measures to prevent malware infections or unauthorized modifications to the website, as required by Article 32.

5. Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing, which was violated due to the breach.

6. Although Farmacia Ardealul notified the DPA of the breach as required by Article 33, the breach itself resulted from non-compliance with security obligations under Article 32, leading to the compromise of sensitive bank data.

7. The breach likely posed a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, such as financial fraud or identity theft, but the insufficient security measures failed to mitigate this risk.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to the failure to implement appropriate security measures under Article 32."
"The controller, Dante International SA, owns the biggest online retailer in Romania (eMAG) and has websites available in three different languages: Romanian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian.

The controller received three different data subject requests regarding their Hungarian website:

Firstly, an account deletion: the request was sent to the controller's generic email address. In response, the controller asked the data subject to send their request dated and signed on paper and then scanned or photographed via email.

Secondly, data erasure: the data subject sent their request to 3 different email addresses and via an online contact form. However, all of the requests were automatically rejected as a third party email security provider considered them as coming from an unsafe domain.

Thirdly, data rectification: a data subject requested to have their email address updated. Even if their request was initially confirmed by the controller, the data subject still received communications to its former email address.

The three data subjects filed complaints with the Hungarian Data Protection Authority which referred them to the Romanian Authority in its quality of lead supervisory authority according to Article 60 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 17","1. The case involves Dante International SA, a controller established in Romania, processing personal data through its Hungarian website, making it subject to GDPR regulations as per Article 3 (Territorial scope).

2. For the account deletion request: The controller required the data subject to send a dated and signed paper request scanned via email. Article 12(2) GDPR requires controllers to ""facilitate the exercise of data subject rights"" and not refuse to act on requests unless they can demonstrate they are not in a position to identify the data subject. Requiring a physical signature creates an unnecessary barrier and violates the principle of facilitating data subject rights.

3. For the data erasure requests: The controller's third-party email security provider automatically rejected requests from ""unsafe domains."" Article 12(4) GDPR states that if the controller does not take action on a request, they must inform the data subject without delay (within one month) of the reasons and the possibility of lodging a complaint. Automatic rejection without human review or proper communication violates this obligation.

4. For the data rectification request: Despite initial confirmation, the controller continued using the old email address. Article 16 GDPR requires controllers to rectify inaccurate personal data ""without undue delay."" Article 19 further requires communication of rectification to each recipient to whom the data were disclosed. The failure to fully implement the rectification across all systems violates these articles.

5. The Hungarian Authority correctly referred the complaints to the Romanian Authority as lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1) GDPR, as the controller's main establishment is in Romania.

6. The controller's actions collectively demonstrate a failure to comply with:
   - Article 12 (Transparent communication and facilitation of rights)
   - Article 16 (Right to rectification)
   - Article 17 (Right to erasure)
   - Article 19 (Notification obligation regarding rectification/erasure)

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"CDON AB (the controller) used Google Analytics tool provided by Google LLC (processor) on its website. For the use of this tool, the controller transferred users’ personal data to the processor, in the US.

The controller and Google had implemented standard contractual clauses (‘SCCs’) within the meaning of Article 46 GDPR.

In 2020, noyb lodged a complaint with the Austrian DPA alleging that the controller breached the provisions of Chapter V GDPR.

The complaint was transferred to the Swedish DPA in its quality of lead supervisory authority pursuant to Article 56 GDPR. Following the complaint, the DPA investigated the data transfers from the controller to the US through the use of Google Analytics.

Following the complaint filed by noyb, the Swedish DPA initiated supervision of the controller. The investigation concerned whether the controller transfers personal data to the US through its use of the Google analytics tool, and whether the controller has legal support for this under Chapter V GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 44, Article 56, Article 60","1. The case involves CDON AB as the controller and Google LLC as the processor, transferring personal data of users to the United States through the use of Google Analytics, which constitutes a transfer of personal data to a third country under Chapter V GDPR (Articles 44-50).

2. The controller relied on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) as an appropriate safeguard under Article 46(2)(c) GDPR for the transfer, which are one of the mechanisms allowed for transfers to third countries without an adequacy decision.

3. However, Article 46(1) GDPR requires that any transfer based on appropriate safeguards must ensure that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies are available in the third country, and the safeguards must be effective in light of the legal environment of that country.

4. The United States does not have an adequacy decision from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR, as confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Schrems II case (C-311/18), which invalidated the Privacy Shield framework and highlighted concerns about US surveillance laws.

5. US surveillance laws, such as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), allow US authorities to access personal data of non-US persons for national security purposes without providing equivalent protection to GDPR standards, such as requiring independent authorization or offering effective judicial redress for data subjects, as per Article 47 and the principles of Articles 44-46.

6. The implementation of SCCs alone does not mitigate the risks posed by US surveillance laws, as SCCs are contractual measures that cannot bind US authorities, and the controller did not demonstrate that additional technical or organizational measures (e.g., encryption that renders data unintelligible to unauthorized parties) were implemented to prevent access, as recommended by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines following Schrems II.

7. Therefore, the transfer does not meet the requirements of Article 46 GDPR, as the appropriate safeguards are not sufficient to ensure an adequate level of protection equivalent to that within the EU, violating the fundamental rights of data subjects under Article 44.

8. The derogations under Article 49 GDPR for specific situations do not apply, as the transfer was not based on consent, necessity for a contract, or other limited exceptions, and the controller did not justify the transfer under these provisions.

9. Consequently, the Swedish DPA, as the lead supervisory authority under Article 56 GDPR, found the transfer noncompliant with Chapter V GDPR.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Starting in May 2023, the ANPC (controller) used body camera devices during on-site investigations performed with businesses. The devices recorded the respective control actions in order to be used as evidences by the ANPC.

Following complaints stating that ANPC breaches data protection legislation by using body camera devices, the DPA opened an investigation. The investigation showed that the recordings captured images of colleagues, employees or representatives of economic operators, as well as other private individuals, including children or adults within shops, swimming pools, restaurants, bars or salons. It also appeared that personal data processed through body camera devices were stored for more than 6 months, without any agreement and without any supervision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the ANPC (a public authority acting as a controller) processing personal data through body camera devices during on-site investigations, capturing images of employees, representatives, and private individuals including children in various settings such as shops and swimming pools (Article 4 definitions of 'controller', 'processing', and 'personal data').

2. The processing lacks a clear lawful basis under Article 6. As a public authority, the ANPC should rely on processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(e)), but must do so under Union or Member State law specifying the purpose and processing conditions (Article 6(3)), which is not evidenced in the case.

3. The recordings likely process special categories of personal data (e.g., biometric data through facial images, and potentially health data in contexts like swimming pools) under Article 9(1), without meeting any exception under Article 9(2), such as explicit consent, substantial public interest based in law, or protection of vital interests, thus violating the prohibition.

4. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects as required under Articles 13 and 14, as there is no indication that individuals were informed about the processing, its purposes, or their rights, particularly in situations where data were not obtained directly from them (e.g., bystanders or children).

5. The principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) is violated, as the body cameras captured broader personal data than necessary (e.g., recording children and other individuals not directly involved in the investigations) without targeted and limited processing.

6. The storage of personal data for over six months without justification contravenes the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), as no criteria or necessity for such duration are indicated, and it exceeds what is necessary for the investigations' purposes.

7. The absence of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection, including supervision and agreements for processing, violates Article 24 and Article 32, which require controllers to implement measures to demonstrate compliance and ensure security of processing.

8. As a public authority processing personal data for law enforcement-like activities, the ANPC may be subject to additional restrictions under Article 23, but no specific legal basis or safeguards are cited, further undermining the lawfulness of the processing.

9. The case involves processing of children's data without specific protections or verifiable parental consent where required, contrary to the emphasis on protecting children's data in recitals and principles of the Regulation (e.g., Article 8 and general principles of fairness).

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations across Articles 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 24, and 32, among others, without evidence of necessary lawful basis, transparency, minimization, storage limitation, or safeguards for special categories of data."
The Employer used biometric readers in its venues for the purposes of keeping adequate records of time for its employees. The Employer had not conducted a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 35","1. The case involves an Employer using biometric readers to record employee time, which constitutes processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying natural persons, falling under the special categories of personal data as defined in Article 9(1).

2. Processing of special categories of personal data, including biometric data, is generally prohibited under Article 9(1), unless one of the specific conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The case does not indicate that any of these conditions (such as explicit consent, employment law necessity, or substantial public interest) were met.

3. Article 35(1) requires controllers to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) prior to processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons. The use of biometric data for employee time tracking constitutes systematic monitoring on a large scale and processing of special categories of data, which are specifically mentioned in Article 35(3) as requiring a DPIA.

4. The Employer's failure to conduct a DPIA for this high-risk processing activity violates Article 35(1) and Article 35(3), as no assessment was performed to evaluate the risks and implement appropriate safeguards.

5. Additionally, the processing appears to violate the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as biometric data (a highly sensitive category) is used for time tracking where less intrusive means (such as card-based systems) could achieve the same purpose.

6. The Employer also likely failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, given the absence of a DPIA and the use of high-risk biometric processing without demonstrated necessity.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations including the prohibition on processing special categories of data without a lawful basis under Article 9, the mandatory DPIA requirement under Article 35, and the principles of data protection by design and data minimization under Articles 25 and 5."
"On 6 March 2020, a guardian lodged a case regarding the visibility of pupils' personal data in an address book of an e-mail system (edu.kunta.fi) used by the education provider (the controller). The applicant stated that every student in the municipality is affected, as their date is displayed in the e-mail records.

The data made visible consisted of the students´ names, classes, schools and school addresses.

On 18 October 2022, the controller made a statement, explaining how the e-mail system worked. The controller argued, inter alia, that limiting the visibility of student data to school-specific data would at least partly prevent cooperation between schools. The controller noted that the e-mail system used does not support the limitation of the visibility of said data.

The controller also declared that as an immediate measure, it would ensure that the data will no longer be visible in the address book and foresees other changes in the IT system of the municipality.

The legal question posed was whether the controller complied with the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR), the principle of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR) and the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR) when making visible the aforementioned personal data of the pupils.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (names, classes, schools, and school addresses) of pupils by an education provider acting as a controller, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1).

2. The controller made pupils' personal data visible in an email system's address book accessible to all users, without implementing adequate access restrictions or purpose-based limitations, violating the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. This principle requires that personal data be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed."" The broad visibility of data across all schools was not justified by a specific necessity, as cooperation between schools could be achieved with more limited data sharing.

3. The controller failed to ensure appropriate security of the personal data, as required by the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. By allowing widespread access to pupils' data without technical measures to restrict visibility based on user roles or school affiliation, the controller did not protect against unauthorized access, contrary to Article 32 GDPR, which mandates implementing appropriate technical measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

4. The controller's initial practice lacked lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The processing of pupils' data in this manner did not have a clear lawful basis under Article 6 GDPR (e.g., consent or legitimate interests), and the transparency requirements under Articles 12-14 GDPR were not adequately met, as data subjects were not properly informed about the extent of data visibility and sharing.

5. The controller's argument that the email system did not support limiting visibility does not absolve compliance obligations under Article 25 GDPR (data protection by design and by default), which requires controllers to implement technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only necessary personal data are processed.

6. The controller's subsequent measures to stop the visibility and plan system changes acknowledge the initial non-compliance but do not rectify the past violation during the period in question.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR principles outlined in Article 5(1)(a), (c), and (f)."
"Bonnier News AB (now Expressen Lifestyle), the controller, is a media company in Sweden. The Bonnier group processed their customers' data for, among other reasons, marketing purposes. They compiled profiles on their users and made these available to affiliated companies who then provided targeted advertisements for their own products and services through direct mail and telemarketing. They relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to do so.

At the time of the investigation,which followed a complaint from a data subject, there were 15 such affiliated companies, with the personal data being collected from users and website visitors being stored in two group-wide data bases from which it was then shared with the affiliate companies. One of these databases was a “behavioral data base”.

The personal data recorded in this database, by means of a cookie identifier, included the URL that the user visited, as well as its category and content type, information on the user’s device and their IP address, behavioral data in terms of time spent and the time the page was viewed and also whether the user logged into the website. In some instances, this data could be linked with the user’s data in the customer data base, resulting in a full behavior profile including the user’s age, gender, their car ownership and some variable based on the users’ residential area, such as their life phase, housing type and purchasing power.

During the course of the investigation, the controller argued that they are not joint controllers in respect of the personal data, and that after the affiliated companies access the data provided in the databases, that they alone are responsible for the legality of that processing.

The controller further argued that while the personal data in the customer database was personal data, the data in the behavioral database was comprised of anonymous data and as such was not personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR.

The controller stated that they rely on legitimate interest as a lawful basis for the profiling of their customers and users to provide personalised advertisements. The controller identified the legitimate interest as being the need to ensure relevant content and advertisements for their customers so that they can offer competitive services and have attractive advertising spaces. The controller also submitted that this interest outweighed the interest of their customers in the protection of their personal data. The controller claimed that such was the case as the customers could object to the profiling, that the customers already have a direct relationship with one (or more) of the affiliates, either from having purchased from their websites or having visited their website, that the processing was unlikely to adversely affect the data subject’s interests as their interaction with the affiliates was voluntary and, finally, that the processing is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6","1. The case involves Bonnier News AB processing personal data for profiling and marketing purposes, including sharing with affiliated companies, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR, as the data includes cookie identifiers, IP addresses, and behavioral data that can be linked to identifiable individuals, making it personal data rather than anonymous.

2. The controller argued that the data in the behavioral database was anonymous, but since it can be linked with the customer database to create full profiles identifying individuals, this claim violates the principle of accuracy and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) and (d), as the data is clearly personal data under Article 4(1).

3. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) for processing, but failed to adequately demonstrate that the processing is necessary or that their interests outweigh the data subjects' rights and freedoms, as required by Article 6(1)(f). The justification—providing relevant ads and competitive services—does not sufficiently address the privacy impact of extensive profiling and data sharing.

4. For processing based on legitimate interests, Article 6(1)(f) requires that data subjects can object under Article 21. The controller mentioned that customers could object, but there is no evidence that data subjects were properly informed of this right in a clear and transparent manner, as mandated by Article 21(4) and Article 12.

5. The controller shared personal data with 15 affiliated companies without clearly informing data subjects about these recipients or categories of recipients, violating the transparency requirements under Article 13(1)(e) and Article 14(1)(e), which require disclosing recipients of personal data.

6. The controller denied being a joint controller with the affiliates, but under Article 26, since Bonnier and the affiliates jointly determine the purposes and means of processing (e.g., group-wide profiling for marketing), they should be considered joint controllers and must have a transparent arrangement defining their responsibilities, which was not established or demonstrated.

7. The profiling activities involve automated processing to evaluate personal aspects, which is profiling under Article 4(4). While for marketing, it may not invoke Article 22 on automated decision-making, the processing must still comply with data subject rights, including the right to object under Article 21, and the principles of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

8. The processing likely violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the collection and sharing of extensive behavioral and customer data for profiling may be excessive for the stated purpose of marketing, and the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b), as data is used for multiple purposes without clear justification.

9. Based on the above, the controller's processing activities fail to comply with multiple GDPR provisions, including Article 4(1) (definition of personal data), Article 5 (principles of processing), Article 6(1)(f) (lawful basis), Article 13/14 (transparency), Article 21 (right to object), and Article 26 (joint controllers).

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A company offering so-called ""small loans"" - eCommerce 2020 ApS (eCommerce) – sent information about non-payments of loans for registration at a credit scoring company - Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

The Icelandic DPA issued a decision (case no. 2020061901 – see summary on GDPRHub) against Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. after the consumers' association of Iceland filed a complaint against it. Following the investigation in that case, it was revealed that the loan terms of eCommerce did not include any provision stating that non-payment (for 40 days) leads to registration of non-payment at Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

However, in this case eCommerce 2020 disputed the fact that such provision was missing and argued that regardless of the wording in the company's loan terms at any given time, borrowers were always informed of the consequences of non-payments on their loans. Furthermore, eCommerce claimed that there was always some kind of provision in the company's loan terms stating that if a loan defaulted, the company has the right to entrust a third party to collect the loan.

It was also revealed that information on non-payments were registered on behalf of eCommerce 2020 ApS despite the fact that the amount of the payment default was below the minimum amount that could be registered according to the terms of the business license of Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

In light of the above, the Icelandic DPA considered that there may be grounds for imposing an administrative fine on eCommerce 2020 ApS, and initiated an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves eCommerce 2020 ApS (eCommerce) as a data controller processing personal data related to loan non-payments, and Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf as a data processor, under GDPR definitions (Article 4(7) and (8)).

2. eCommerce failed to provide transparent information to data subjects (borrowers) about the processing of their personal data for credit scoring purposes. According to Article 13(1)(c) and (2)(a), when collecting personal data directly from data subjects, controllers must inform them about the purposes of processing and the legal basis for processing at the time of data collection.

3. The loan terms did not include any provision stating that non-payment for 40 days would lead to registration at a credit scoring company, violating Article 13's requirement for transparent information about processing purposes and legal basis.

4. eCommerce's argument that borrowers were ""always informed"" is insufficient under Article 12, which requires information to be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language. The absence of this information in the formal loan terms constitutes a violation.

5. The processing of personal data (reporting non-payments) lacked a proper legal basis under Article 6. Without transparent disclosure and obtaining explicit consent (where required), eCommerce could not rely on legitimate interests or other lawful bases for this processing.

6. The registration of payment defaults below the minimum amount permitted by Creditinfo's business license terms violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and the requirement for processing to have a proper legal basis under Article 6.

7. The processing of special categories of personal data (financial information related to payment defaults) requires additional safeguards under Article 9, which were not properly implemented through transparent information and appropriate legal basis.

8. eCommerce failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2), as they could not prove compliance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency in their processing activities.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In March 2021, the Irish DPA became aware of allegations made publicly by a staff member of the Department of Health (DOH). According to these allegations, the DOH, as a controller, collected and processed personal data of plaitinffs of health services to children with special education needs (SEN).

The DPA opened and inquiry to investigate 29 litigation files related to the matter.

On the files, the DPA found evidence that the controller collected information about services that were provided to plaintiffs and their families. To do so, the controller submitted broadly worded questions asking the Health Services Executive (HSE) - an agency under it remit - to share “any other issues HSE feels worth mentioning.” This broad question resulted in the provision of private information about the lives of plaintiffs and their families, including details about plaintiff’s jobs and living circumstances, information about their parents’ marital difficulties and in one case, information received directly from a doctor about the services that were being provided to the plaintiff.

In response to the DPA, the controller claimed that personal data were processed only for the purposes of determining whether an approach should be made to the plaintiff to seek to settle the case.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves the Department of Health (DOH) as a controller processing personal data of plaintiffs in health services litigation, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out by a public authority and involves automated processing or structured filing systems.

2. The DOH collected personal data through broadly worded questions asking for ""any other issues HSE feels worth mentioning,"" which resulted in processing extensive personal information including details about plaintiffs' jobs, living circumstances, and parental marital difficulties. This violates the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), as the data collected exceeded what was necessary for the specified purpose of determining whether to settle cases.

3. The processing also violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the controller collected excessive and irrelevant personal data that was not limited to what was necessary for the purposes of the litigation settlement process.

4. The controller failed to identify a proper lawful basis for processing under Article 6. While claiming the processing was for settlement purposes, the broad collection of sensitive personal data without a specific legal basis (such as consent or necessity for legal claims) makes the processing unlawful.

5. The processing included special categories of personal data (e.g., health data, family circumstances) under Article 9(1), which requires explicit consent or specific exceptions under Article 9(2). The controller did not demonstrate that any of these exceptions applied, making the processing of sensitive data unlawful.

6. The controller violated transparency obligations under Articles 12-14 by not properly informing data subjects about the extent of data collection and processing, particularly regarding the broad nature of information being requested from the HSE.

7. The controller's actions contravene the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they failed to demonstrate compliance with data protection principles and did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure lawful processing.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Icelandic DPA received a notification from the Office of the National Medical Examiner (the controller) about a security breach in its website (Heilsuvera – an online healthcare system and a prescription portal). Personal data of individuals were made available to unauthorised parties through the website.

For example, it was possible that after logging in to the Heilsuvera website, to manipulate so-called parameters to see unauthorized messages (i.e. by right-clicking on the computer mouse to access a code on a specific page on the website and then change it to see another page in the area). It was revealed that it was possible to change the URL of a sonogram image that individuals were given access to from the medical records system in order to see other images within the system, i.e. attachments that were saved there.

The controller explained that the data breach followed, among other things, because there was a fault in the connection cable due to communication with a system outside the Heilsuvera website. More specifically, the controls on the API, which are activated when documents are retrieved from outside the Heilsuvera website, did not have sufficient functionality to confirm rights to access the data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves a security breach at the Office of the National Medical Examiner (controller) where personal data from the Heilsuvera website was accessible to unauthorized parties through URL manipulation and API vulnerabilities, as described in the case details.

2. Article 32(1) of the policy requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. The controller's failure to implement sufficient API controls to verify access rights constitutes a violation of this requirement.

3. Article 5(1)(f) of the policy stipulates that personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The ability to manipulate URLs to access unauthorized medical records and sonogram images demonstrates a failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of personal data.

4. Article 24(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the regulation. The controller's explanation regarding faulty connection cables and insufficient API functionality indicates a lack of adequate measures to safeguard personal data.

5. The breach resulted in unauthorized access to special categories of health data, which are subject to stricter processing conditions under Article 9. The failure to protect such sensitive data exacerbates the severity of the violation.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to the controller's failure to implement appropriate security measures, leading to unauthorized access to personal data in violation of Articles 5(1)(f), 9, 24(1), and 32(1)."
"“Palermo Today”, an online newspaper, published an article about the arrest of the data subject, a well-known mafia boss who had been a fugitive for 30 years. Among the circumstances of the arrest, the article also revealed information about the state of health of the data subject and included a complete copy of his laboratory records.

On 18 January 2023, the DPA adopted a temporary measure against the controller, Citynews S.p.A. (the owner of the newspaper), limiting the further dissemination of the data subject’s health data.

The controller complied with the above measures, modifying the article, deleting the data subject’s health records and requesting Google to deindex the information. It pointed out that the journalistic content had no intention of harming the dignity of the data subject and claimed that the information had been expressly deemed unpublishable, but the Director responsible, in an autonomous decision, considered it was of public interest and decided to publish it.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data, specifically health data and laboratory records of the data subject (a mafia boss), by ""Palermo Today"" (owned by Citynews S.p.A.), which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the policy.

2. The health data and laboratory records constitute special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies.

3. The controller claimed the processing was for journalistic purposes and in the public interest. While Article 85 allows Member States to provide exemptions for processing for journalistic purposes, such exemptions must reconcile the right to data protection with freedom of expression and information, and require specific legal provisions at the Member State level. The case does not indicate that such national laws were invoked or complied with.

4. The publication of the data subject's full health records and laboratory data exceeds the principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), as revealing detailed health information was not necessary for the journalistic purpose of reporting on the arrest.

5. The processing violated Article 9(1) as no applicable exception under Article 9(2) was properly invoked. The controller's reference to ""public interest"" was an autonomous decision by the Director, not based on Union or Member State law as required by Article 9(2)(g) or (i).

6. The DPA's intervention through a temporary measure under Article 58(2) confirmed the noncompliance, particularly regarding the processing of special category data without a valid legal basis and the disproportionate impact on the data subject's rights.

7. The controller's subsequent actions (modifying the article, deleting health data, and requesting deindexing) demonstrate acknowledgment of the violation and attempt to mitigate, but do not rectify the initial noncompliance.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"An individual (controller) forwarded an e-mail containing the residential address and date of birth of some individuals to 46 unauthorized recipients. Therefore, the DPA opened an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves an individual acting as a controller who processed personal data (residential addresses and dates of birth) by forwarding an email to 46 unauthorized recipients, as defined under Article 4(1) and (2) of the policy, where personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, and processing includes disclosure by transmission.

2. The controller's action of forwarding personal data to unauthorized recipients violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized disclosure.

3. The processing lacks a lawful basis under Article 6(1), as the forwarding of personal data to unauthorized recipients does not fall under any of the conditions for lawful processing, such as consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests.

4. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), which specifically includes preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

5. The unauthorized disclosure constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), defined as a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data.

6. The controller did not notify the supervisory authority of the personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as required by Article 33(1), which is mandatory unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms.

7. The breach likely resulted in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects (e.g., privacy, potential identity theft), yet the controller failed to communicate the breach to the data subjects without undue delay, as required by Article 34(1).

8. The controller's actions also violate the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles, including ensuring lawful and secure processing.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A Latvian court requested the Latvian National Health Service to share some data concerning a minor. In such an order, the data subject was identified by name and surname and a numerical code, which turned out to be wrong.

The National Health Service, the controller, identified a wrong data subject by means of the personal numerical code and disclosed their health data to the court.

The Latvian DPA started an investigation against the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of health data, which is a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, requiring stricter safeguards for lawful processing.
2. The controller (Latvian National Health Service) processed personal data based on a court order, which may serve as a legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation) or Article 9(2)(f) (legal claims), but must be implemented with appropriate accuracy and security measures as per Article 5(1)(d) and Article 32.
3. The controller failed to ensure data accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) by using an incorrect numerical code, leading to the misidentification of the data subject and unauthorized disclosure of health data to the court.
4. This inaccurate processing resulted in a violation of Article 9, as special category data was disclosed without proper verification, and potentially violated Article 6(1) principles of lawfulness since the processing did not correctly correspond to the court's intended subject.
5. The controller breached Article 32(1) security requirements by not implementing adequate technical measures to verify the correctness of the numerical code before disclosure, despite the known sensitivity of health data.
6. The unauthorized disclosure constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as health data was transmitted to an incorrect recipient (the court, regarding the wrong individual), requiring notification under Articles 33-34, though the case does not mention this being done.
7. The Latvian DPA’s investigation is justified under Article 58(1) powers, as the controller’s actions infringed multiple GDPR principles, including accuracy (Article 5(1)(d)), lawfulness (Article 6(1)), and security (Article 32(1)) for special category data (Article 9).
8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"In 2019,  the Special Privacy Unit of the Guardia di Finanza opened a preliminary investigation on the Benetton Group, the controller, regarding the processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes.

In this preliminary procedure, the following issues were identified: a) the cookie banner used on the familycard.benetton.com website did not allow users to deselect some types of cookies and did not mention profiling cookies although they were used; b) the cookie banner on the blackcard.sisley.com site presented a ""click here"" hypertext link leading to a blank page that did not provide the relevant information; c) contrary to what was informed during the registration procedure, personal data collected for the loyalty programs were being stored since 2015, even for customers who did not give their consent to profiling; d) promotional e-mails were sent to customers even after they had opted out of the loyalty program or  withdrawn their consent for marketing communications.

In its defense, the controller stated that the information on the familycard.benetton.com site mentioned cookies for direct marketing, marketing and retargeting cookies of third parties, which, in its view, fell under the definition of profiling cookies. It also claimed that the retention period was in line with the loyalty program, which provided for up to 10 years of retention in order to assess the scores and prizes awarded to members. Moreover, it alleged that its management systems were differentiated between those dedicated to loyalty cards, to digital customers, and its newsletters. According to the controller, each system was managed separately and based on different documentation, so that the customer can decide what type of communication they want to receive. Finally, it claimed to have implemented organizational and technical measures to overcome possible critical profiles identified during the investigations.

The procedure was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic and resumed only in 2021, when the Italian DPA carried out an on-site inspection to verify the measures that the controller claimed to have implemented. In this inspection, the DPA found that: a) the personal data of customers were being stored for indefinite time without a justification; b) personal data of customers were being transferred to third parties for marketing and profiling purposes without consent; c) vulnerabilities regarding the stores' platform such access to the loyalty program system without the need for a login.

With regard to these findings, the controller stated that the data collected through the website was retained for the purpose of allowing customers to use their services uninterruptedly over time. However, it informed that a retention period of was 10 years would be set, without prejudice to an automatic deactivation system in case of inactivity for 24 months. The controller also admitted that the stores' management platform had some technical limitations, but informed that it was already being replaced by a new one.

Finally, the controller argued that Tik Tok and Facebook are commercial partners with whom it signed a contract for the publication of advertising banners. However, it denied transferring data to them and that they processed data on its behalf. According to the controller, Benetton limited itself to preparing advertising content and purchasing the advertising ""spaces"" or areas managed exclusively by the partner companies, without providing them with any personal data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves the Benetton Group as a data controller processing personal data for marketing and profiling purposes through its loyalty programs and websites, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processing'.

2. The cookie banners on Benetton's websites did not allow users to deselect some types of cookies and failed to properly mention profiling cookies, violating Article 13 (Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject) which requires transparent information about processing purposes, and Article 7 (Conditions for consent) which mandates that consent must be freely given, specific, and informed through clear affirmative action.

3. The hypertext link in one cookie banner led to a blank page, failing to provide required information, which violates Article 12 (Transparent information, communication and modalities) which requires information to be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.

4. Personal data was stored indefinitely without justification, contrary to Article 5(1)(e) (Principles relating to processing) which requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.

5. Personal data was transferred to third parties (TikTok and Facebook) for marketing and profiling purposes without valid consent, violating Article 6 (Lawfulness of processing) which requires a lawful basis such as consent, and Article 44 (General principle for transfers) which requires appropriate safeguards for transfers to third countries.

6. The controller's claim that it merely purchased advertising spaces without transferring data is contradicted by the DPA's findings of data transfers for profiling, potentially violating Article 26 (Joint controllers) if Benetton and the social media platforms were jointly determining purposes and means of processing without proper arrangements.

7. Vulnerabilities in the stores' platform allowing unauthorized access to the loyalty program system violate Article 32 (Security of processing) which requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

8. The controller's proposed 10-year retention period with 24-month inactivity deactivation lacks demonstrated necessity and proportionality under Article 5(1)(c) (Data minimisation) and Article 5(1)(e) (Storage limitation), especially for customers who had withdrawn consent or opted out.

9. Sending promotional emails after opt-out or consent withdrawal violates Article 7(3) (Right to withdraw consent) and Article 21 (Right to object) which require that data subjects can easily withdraw consent or object to processing, and that controllers must cease processing promptly upon such withdrawal or objection.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A solarium studio in Hungary, the controller, had installed a CCTV system within its premises. Although the decision is not clear in this regard, an individual, the data subject, whose image had been recorded by such system, objected to the processing under Article 21 GDPR. Following a notification, the DPA initiated an ex officio investigation with regard to the solarium studio’s video surveillance system.

The controller argued that it had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for carrying out the camera surveillance on the premises in order to, inter alia, protect the property. However, despite the DPA’s multiple requests, the controller did not provide any balancing of interests test, nor did it make any statement to the authority of having such document.

Furthermore, in light of Article 13(1)(2) GDPR, the controller claimed that there were printed privacy notices available at the front desk of studio. With regard to its employees, the controller claimed that it had provided information on the processing operations orally and within the job descriptions. However, the controller did not provide evidence to support its statements.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 13","1. The controller (solarium studio) processed personal data via CCTV surveillance, which falls under the definition of processing in Article 4(2) GDPR, requiring a lawful basis under Article 6.

2. The controller claimed Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) as their legal basis but failed to provide a balancing of interests test when requested by the DPA, violating the accountability principle under Article 5(2) which requires controllers to be able to demonstrate compliance with all principles of data processing.

3. Article 6(1)(f) requires that the controller's interests be balanced against the data subject's fundamental rights, and the controller's failure to document or provide this assessment means they cannot demonstrate compliance with this requirement, as reinforced by Recital 47 which emphasizes the necessity of a careful assessment.

4. The controller claimed to provide privacy notices under Article 13(1) but failed to provide evidence of this to the DPA, violating Article 12(1) which requires controllers to take appropriate measures to provide information relating to processing in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form.

5. Regarding employee information, the controller's claim of oral notifications and job description inclusions without supporting evidence violates Article 13's requirement to provide specific information at the time when personal data are obtained, and Article 12's general obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.

6. The data subject's objection under Article 21(1) triggers the controller's obligation to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds under Article 21(1), which the controller failed to do due to the absence of a documented balancing test.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of the accountability principle (Article 5(2)), legitimate interest requirements (Article 6(1)(f)), transparency obligations (Articles 12 and 13), and the right to object (Article 21)."
"The National Consumer Protection Authority (ANPC) - the controller - decided to provide a dedicated mobile phone number for the sending of consumer complaints through WhatsApp messages. In the context of several petitions and notifications through this channel, the controller collected numerous personal data. After considering several complaints with regard to this practice, as well as the news published in various media outlets, the Romanian DPA initiated an investigation on the use of WhatsApp by the ANPC.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the National Consumer Protection Authority (ANPC) as a data controller processing personal data through WhatsApp messages for consumer complaints, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) since it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The controller failed to ensure compliance with Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle) as using WhatsApp, a third-party service, without demonstrating appropriate security measures for protecting personal data against unauthorized processing or access, especially given that WhatsApp's parent company (Meta) is based outside the EU/EEA.

3. The processing lacked a lawful basis under Article 6, as the controller did not obtain explicit consent from data subjects for using WhatsApp (which involves international data transfer) nor demonstrated necessity for performance of a task carried out in the public interest with proper safeguards, as required for public authorities.

4. The controller violated Article 25 (data protection by design and by default) by not implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only necessary personal data was processed through a secure channel, instead relying on a commercial messaging service not designed for official governmental communication.

5. There was a breach of Article 32 (security of processing) as the controller failed to implement adequate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including encryption and confidentiality, given that WhatsApp's encryption protocols are controlled by a third party outside EU jurisdiction.

6. The controller did not conduct a mandatory data protection impact assessment under Article 35 prior to initiating the processing, despite using new technologies (WhatsApp) for large-scale processing of personal data, which likely presents high risks to data subjects' rights.

7. The transfer of personal data to WhatsApp (Meta Platforms Inc.) constitutes a transfer to a third country without adequate safeguards under Article 44, as the controller did not implement appropriate transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules, nor demonstrate adequacy decisions applicable to the United States.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The data subject was a 4 year old minor, who attended a birthday party at one of the establishments of the controller, Nandivale. The controller posted images showing the faces of children present at the party in the stories of its Instagram profile.

After seeing the stories, the mother of the data sent an Instagram message to the controller, asking it to delete the image. However, the controller did not comply with the request and she filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA, claiming that she never gave her consent for the publication of her child's image.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves a data subject who is a 4-year-old minor and a controller (Nandivale) that processes personal data by posting images showing children's faces on Instagram, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, since it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The images constitute personal data under Article 4(1), as they relate to an identifiable natural person (the child), and processing includes publication on social media as defined in Article 4(2).

3. For processing personal data of a child under 16 years old, Article 8 requires that consent be given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility. The mother, as the holder of parental responsibility, did not provide consent for the publication, and the controller failed to make reasonable efforts to verify such consent as required by Article 8(2).

4. The processing of biometric data (facial images) for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person is considered a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), which is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller did not have explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or any other valid exception, making the processing unlawful.

5. The controller failed to comply with the data subject's request for erasure via the mother's Instagram message. Under Article 17(1), the data subject has the right to erasure where personal data have been unlawfully processed, and the controller had an obligation to erase the data without undue delay.

6. The controller's non-response to the erasure request violates Article 12(3), which requires the controller to provide information on action taken without undue delay and within one month, and Article 12(4), which mandates informing the data subject of the reasons for not taking action and the possibility of lodging a complaint.

7. The processing also lacks a lawful basis under Article 6, as consent was not obtained, and no other basis such as legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) could override the rights of the child, given the sensitive nature of the data and the context.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations including unlawful processing of special category data without consent, failure to comply with the right to erasure, and inadequate response to the data subject's request."
"The controller managed a website called “Locate Family” which collected and published information about population in several countries. This information included address, phone number, name and surname of data subjects. The website enabled users to find relatives and friends in other countries.

The Latvian DPA started an ex officio investigation.

The controller claimed that the GDPR was not applicable to them, as the controller had no establishment within the EU. Moreover, the controller argued that data were collected prior to the the GDPR and by public available sources, where data were originally uploaded with the consent of the data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a controller (""Locate Family"" website) processing personal data (names, addresses, phone numbers) of individuals in several countries, including EU Member States, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1) as processing by automated means.

2. The controller claimed the GDPR was not applicable due to lack of establishment in the EU. However, Article 3(2) states that the GDPR applies to processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to: (a) the offering of goods or services to such data subjects in the Union, or (b) the monitoring of their behavior as far as their behavior takes place within the Union. The website's purpose of enabling users to find relatives and friends in other countries constitutes offering services to data subjects in the Union, making the GDPR applicable.

3. The controller argued that data were collected prior to the GDPR and from public available sources with original consent. However, Article 5(1)(a) requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Even if data were initially collected with consent, further processing for a different purpose (publishing on a website for locating people) requires a new lawful basis under Article 6, which the controller did not demonstrate.

4. The processing of regular personal data (names, addresses, phone numbers) requires a lawful basis under Article 6. The controller did not establish any lawful basis such as consent, legitimate interests, or others for processing and publishing this data.

5. For processing personal data from publicly accessible sources, Article 14 requires the controller to provide specific information to data subjects about the processing, including the source of the data and the purposes of processing, unless providing such information proves impossible or would involve disproportionate effort. The controller did not demonstrate compliance with these information obligations.

6. The controller's publication of personal data without proper safeguards likely violates the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)), as making personal data widely accessible increases risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

7. The controller, being established outside the EU but processing data of EU data subjects, was required under Article 27 to designate a representative in the Union, which they apparently failed to do.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."
"The controller – a company – kept a database with special categories of personal data of its employees. The database was kept for the purpose of choosing the employees to fire at the end of a probationary period. Such database included information about the psychological status of some employees, requests for psychotherapy, and their likeliness to join a workers’ union. A data subject lodged a complaint and a German DPA (Berlin) started an investigation against the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9","1. The case involves a controller (a company) processing special categories of personal data of its employees, including information about psychological status, requests for psychotherapy, and likelihood to join a workers' union, which falls under the definition of special categories in Article 9(1) as it includes data concerning health and trade union membership.

2. The processing of special categories of personal data is generally prohibited under Article 9(1), unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller's purpose (choosing employees to fire after probation) does not align with any lawful exception under Article 9(2), such as explicit consent, employment obligations, vital interests, or substantial public interest, making the processing unlawful.

3. The processing lacks a valid legal basis under Article 6, as using sensitive data for termination decisions does not qualify as necessary for contract performance, legal obligation, legitimate interests, or any other lawful ground, especially given the discriminatory nature of the criteria used.

4. The purpose of processing (selecting employees for termination based on sensitive data) violates the principle of purpose limitation in Article 5(1)(b), as it is incompatible with the original purposes for which the data was likely collected (e.g., employment records or health services).

5. The processing fails to ensure data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as collecting and using psychological and union-related data for termination decisions is excessive and not necessary for the stated purpose.

6. The controller likely did not provide adequate information to data subjects under Articles 13 and 14, as employees were probably unaware of this specific processing purpose, undermining transparency and fairness.

7. The processing infringes on data subjects' rights under Articles 15–22, as the use of sensitive data for discriminatory termination decisions could have been challenged through access, rectification, or objection rights, which were not facilitated.

8. The German DPA's investigation confirms the noncompliance, and the controller's actions could lead to penalties under Article 83, particularly under Article 83(5)(a) for violating basic principles related to special data processing.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"QUALITY-PROVIDER S.A, the controller, provides data services and processes personal data as part of its core activities. The Spanish DPA, prompted by a data subject's complaint, initiated proceedings to investigate alleged violations of the GDPR in relation to activities carried out through the controller's website. During the investigations, the DPA requested the controller to provide some information and documents relating to the investigated facts.

However, the controller refused to provide the information, claiming that the request did not include a copy of the data subject's national identity card, which prevented it from reliably identifying the person and the data concerned.

Then, the DPA decided to carry out an on-site inspection and informed the controller that its representatives should cooperate with the inspectors, facilitating access to the files.

Again, the controller refused to comply with the request, arguing that: a) the Spanish DPA was not competent for the inspection and was not a public body like the other European supervisory authorities; b) the Director of the Spanish DPA could not initiate the proceedings as the position had been extinguished by a decree; c) that Spain had not transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law and that this directive should have been applied directly. Moreover, the controller stated that it would record the inspection and expose the recording in court.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 58,"1. The case involves QUALITY-PROVIDER S.A as a controller processing personal data as part of its core activities, making it subject to GDPR obligations under Article 4(7) and Article 24.

2. The Spanish DPA initiated proceedings based on a data subject's complaint, which falls within its competence under Article 55(1) and its investigative powers under Article 58(1)(a) to order the controller to provide any information required for performance of its tasks.

3. The controller's refusal to provide requested information based on lack of a data subject's national identity card violates Article 31, which requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request, and Article 58(1)(a) which grants DPAs the power to require information from controllers.

4. The controller's additional refusal during the on-site inspection based on claims of the Spanish DPA's incompetence is unfounded as Article 55(1) establishes that each supervisory authority is competent for performance of tasks on its territory, and Article 56 confirms the lead supervisory authority mechanism doesn't apply to purely domestic cases.

5. The controller's claim about the Director's position being extinguished contradicts Article 52 on the independence of supervisory authorities and Article 53 on general conditions for members, as Member States must ensure supervisory authorities can perform their tasks independently with proper resources.

6. The controller's reference to Directive (EU) 2019/1937 is irrelevant to GDPR compliance, as Article 58 explicitly grants DPAs investigative powers including on-site inspections under Article 58(1)(f), regardless of other directives.

7. The controller's stated intention to record the inspection and expose it in court potentially violates the obligation to cooperate under Article 31 and may constitute obstruction of the DPA's lawful investigative activities under Article 58.

8. The controller's repeated refusals to comply with the DPA's requests demonstrate a failure to meet the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the cooperation requirement under Article 31.

9. The case shows multiple violations of GDPR provisions including Article 31 (cooperation with supervisory authority), Article 58 (powers of supervisory authorities), and the general principle of accountability under Article 5(2).

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The Ing Bank NV branch in Bucarest, as a controller, notified the Romanian DPA of a data breach under the GDPR. The DPA opened a procedure to further investigate the facts and found that the controller shared a .pdf file through Whatsapp containing personal data of a significant number of its customers.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Ing Bank NV branch in Bucharest as a controller processing personal data of its customers, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means (sharing a digital file via WhatsApp).

2. The controller shared a .pdf file containing personal data through WhatsApp, which constitutes processing under Article 4(2) (""any operation performed on personal data, including disclosure by transmission"").

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.

4. Article 32(1) mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including encryption and confidentiality of processing systems.

5. Sharing personal data via WhatsApp, a third-party messaging service, without demonstrating adequate safeguards (such as end-to-end encryption for business communications or ensuring recipient authorization) likely violates the security principle under Article 5(1)(f) and the specific security requirements of Article 32, as it exposes data to potential unauthorized access or interception.

6. Article 44 prohibits transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations unless adequate safeguards are in place. While WhatsApp may use encryption, its parent company (Meta) is based in the U.S., and the transfer of EU personal data to U.S. servers would require compliance with Chapter V (e.g., adequacy decisions under Article 45 or appropriate safeguards under Article 46). The controller failed to demonstrate such compliance.

7. The breach notification under Article 33 confirms a personal data breach occurred, but the investigation revealed the breach resulted from insecure processing practices (using WhatsApp for sharing sensitive customer data), indicating a failure to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

8. The controller, as per Article 24, is responsible for demonstrating compliance with GDPR principles, including security and lawful processing. The use of WhatsApp without validated safeguards shows insufficient measures to protect data subjects' rights.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 32, 44, and 25."
"The Latvian DPA, in cooperation with the Estonian and the Lithuanian one, started a joint investigation about the processing of personal data in the context of car rental services. In particular, there were doubts about the lawfulness of processing activities undertaken by a company – the controller – in the context of a mobile app necessary to use the car rental services. Therefore, the DPA carried out data protection audits and requested access to personal data and other information necessary to the fulfilment of its tasks pursuant to Article 58(1)(b) and (e) GDPR. The controller was “unreachable” and did not comply with the DPA’s instructions. The DPA formally opened a sanctioning procedure against the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a joint investigation by the Latvian, Estonian, and Lithuanian Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) regarding a car rental company's processing of personal data through a mobile app, with the company acting as the controller under the GDPR (Article 4(7)).

2. The DPAs exercised their investigative powers under Article 58(1)(b) GDPR by carrying out data protection audits and under Article 58(1)(e) GDPR by requesting access to personal data and other necessary information to fulfil their tasks.

3. Article 31 GDPR requires controllers and processors to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request. The controller's failure to respond and comply with the DPA's instructions constitutes a violation of this obligation.

4. The controller's non-cooperation specifically infringes Article 58(1) GDPR, which grants supervisory authorities the power to obtain access to any information necessary for the performance of their tasks, and the controller is obliged to comply.

5. The controller's actions (being ""unreachable"" and not complying) demonstrate a failure to adhere to the principle of accountability under Article 5(2) GDPR, as the controller is responsible for demonstrating compliance with the Regulation.

6. Infringements of the obligations of the controller under Article 31 GDPR are subject to administrative fines under Article 83(4)(a) GDPR, which can be up to €10 million or 2% of global annual turnover.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"Independent of any instructions from the XVIII District Office of the Government of Budapest, the municipality of Pestszentlőrinc‑Pestszentimre carried out a survey on the COVID-19 vaccination status of its local citizens. The controller aimed to produce anonymised statistics on the basis of which municipal decisions in relation to the pandemic could be made.

To send the questionnaire, the controller lawfully obtained the names and addresses of all adult residents in the area. The questionnaire, on the other hand, was deemed non-compliant. It did not make clear that data subjects’ name, telephone number and email address were optional. It did not specify that the name, telephone number and email address, when provided, would be processed alongisde the health data. Lastly, consent to processing was only available upon completion of the questionnaire, when the data had already been submitted.

After a public interest notification, the case was referred to the Hungarian DPA under Hungarian national law.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14","1. The case involves the processing of health data (COVID-19 vaccination status) by the municipality of Pestszentlőrinc-Pestszentimre, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. Health data is classified as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), which prohibits its processing unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller relied on consent as the legal basis for processing, which would require explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a).

3. The questionnaire failed to clearly indicate that providing name, telephone number, and email address was optional, violating the requirement for consent to be specific and informed under Article 7(2) and Article 4(11), which defines consent as requiring a clear affirmative action.

4. The controller did not specify that the provided personal data would be processed alongside health data, violating Article 13(1)(c), which requires controllers to inform data subjects of the purposes and legal basis for processing at the time of data collection.

5. Consent was only obtained after data submission, contrary to Article 7(2), which requires that consent be obtained prior to processing, and Article 6(1)(a), which mandates that consent must be given before processing begins.

6. The processing operation did not adhere to the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the collection of unnecessary personal data (names, telephone numbers, email addresses) was not clearly optional and was not strictly necessary for the stated purpose of producing anonymized statistics.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13."
"In 2020, the Italian DPA issued Provision n. 10 authorizing the processing of personal data necessary for the creation of a permanent census as part of the national statistical program carried out by the Italian National Institute of Statistics, the controller. While authorizing the creation of the permanent census, the DPA ordered the controller to implement the following security and data protection measures:

a) adopt a pseudonymisation technique [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR]; b) apply the principles of data minimization [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR], purpose limitation [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR] and storage limitation [Article 5(1)(e) GDPR]; c) and to implement privacy by design and by default [Article 25 GDPR].

The provision also addressed specific critical issues in relation to the attribution of a unique code that identifies the individual in the various databases, requiring the controller to implement a rotating decoupling mechanism of pseudonymised codes.

Considering the complexity of these measures, the DPA found that it was necessary to follow their implementation so that compliance with data protection principles was ensured. Therefore, it opened an investigation on the controller based on Article 58(1) (a), (e) and (f) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves the Italian National Institute of Statistics as the controller processing personal data for a permanent census under the authorization of the Italian DPA (Provision n. 10), which falls under the scope of GDPR as statistical processing (Article 2, Article 89).

2. The DPA explicitly required the controller to implement specific technical and organizational measures including pseudonymisation (Article 5(1)(f)), data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), and privacy by design and by default (Article 25), along with a rotating decoupling mechanism for pseudonymised codes.

3. The DPA found it necessary to open an investigation under Article 58(1)(a), (e), and (f) GDPR to monitor the implementation of these measures, indicating that the controller's current processing activities were suspected of not fully complying with the mandated data protection principles and safeguards.

4. Article 5(1) requires that personal data shall be processed in accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, and integrity/confidentiality. The controller's failure to adequately implement these principles as specifically mandated by the DPA constitutes a violation of these fundamental requirements.

5. Article 25 requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures both at the time of determining the means for processing and at the time of processing itself to ensure data protection principles are effectively implemented. The need for the DPA to investigate suggests the controller failed to meet these obligations at the processing stage.

6. The case demonstrates that despite the DPA's authorization and specific instructions, the controller's processing operations required ongoing supervision through investigation, indicating that the processing was not initially compliant with the required data protection standards.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy as the controller failed to fully implement the necessary data protection measures as required by the GDPR principles and the DPA's specific provisions."
"The controller allegedly processed personal data - and specifically audio recordings containing the voice of their customers – in an unlawful way.

The Latvian DPA asked the controller to provide information concerning the processing in the context of an ex officio investigation. The controller first asked for the deadline to be extended and then stopped replying to the DPA.

Thus, the Latvian DPA opened a sanctioning procedure against the controller.

After that, the controller replied to the DPA’s request and provided the information.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 58,"1. The case involves a controller processing personal data, specifically audio recordings containing customers' voices, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4 of the GDPR, as it relates to identifiable natural persons.

2. The Latvian DPA, as a supervisory authority under Article 51, has the task of monitoring the application of the GDPR and conducting investigations, as per Article 57(1)(a).

3. During an ex officio investigation, the DPA requested information from the controller concerning the processing, which is within its powers under Article 58(1)(a), allowing it to order the controller to provide any information required for its tasks.

4. Under Article 31 of the GDPR, the controller is obligated to cooperate with the supervisory authority on request, which includes providing requested information without undue delay.

5. The controller initially asked for an extension but then stopped replying to the DPA, failing to provide the information in a timely manner, which violates Article 31.

6. The controller's failure to cooperate constitutes an infringement of the GDPR, as it did not comply with the DPA's lawful request for information, as specified in Article 58(1)(a).

7. This infringement is subject to administrative fines under Article 83(4)(a), which covers violations of obligations under Articles 25-39, including Article 31.

8. The controller's subsequent provision of information after the sanctioning procedure was opened does not absolve the initial non-compliance, as the obligation to cooperate was immediate and ongoing.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to the controller's failure to cooperate with the supervisory authority."
"A complaint was initially submitted against Airbnb to a German DPA on 6 July 2018. In the complaint the data subject claimed that Airbnb had failed to comply with two erasure requests he had made on 18 September 2015 and 12 October 2015. The Complainant discovered that his erasure requests had not been complied with when, on 9 June 2018, he found that his account was still active. The complainant submitted an access request to Airbnb (the controller) on 6 July 2018, asking Airbnb to provide information regarding: a) What data they had stored about him, b) Where they obtained the data from, c) What legal basis was used for processing the data, d) To which other parties the data has been transferred to.

In this access request, the data subject expressly objected to a transfer to third parties and asked why his previous erasure requests from 2015 had not been carried out. In this email, he also resubmitted an access request.

On 6 July 2018, Airbnb acknowledged receipt of his email and responded on 17 July 2018 via email, requesting further information from the data subject in order to verify his identity to facilitate the access and erasure requests. In this email, Airbnb asked for a copy of the data subjects’ identification documents.

On 18 July 2018, the data subject responded, refusing to provide a copy of his ID. Airbnb responded to this email on 19 July 2018, asking to verify the data subject’s identity via telephone call instead, the data subject agreed. On 31 July 2018, Airbnb conducted a telephone call with the data subject to authenticate his requests.

On 30 August 2018, Airbnb responded to the data subject’s access request by email and provided a copy of the data but did not acknowledge the erasure request. The data subject’s access request was made in German, and all other communications with Airbnb were also made in German. However, the email attaching his personal data was in English and contained unsorted table columns with incomprehensible column headings.

On 11 September 2018, the data subject responded to Airbnb’s previous communication, claiming that their response to his access request was incomplete. On 13 September 2018, Airbnb acknowledged receipt of the data subject’s email but made no further communications with the data subject.

The original complaint which was submitted on 6 July 2018 was then transferred to the Berlin DPA on 1 January 2019, as Airbnb’s German offices were based in Berlin. On 7 February 2020, the Berlin DPA transferred the complaint to the Irish DPA (DPC) in its capacity as the lead supervisory authority, as Airbnb’s main establishment is in Ireland (Articles 56 and 60 GDPR). However, all communications between the DPC and the data subject were still made through the Berlin DPA. On 13 May 2020, the DPC notified Airbnb of the complaint.

On 27 May Airbnb responded to the DPC, noting that the 2015-pre GDPR erasure requests had not been upheld because their systems registered them as spam-mail. Moreover, in relation to the access and erasure requests made by the data subject on 6 July 2018, Airbnb stated that the file was provided on 28 August following the confirmation of the data subject’s identity and that the data subject’s erasure request was “commenced on 29 August 2018.” In addition, as to Airbnb’s incomplete access request response, Airbnb noted that it had referred the data subject to sections 2,3,4 and 7 of its Privacy Policy, which Airbnb argued addressed the questions on “which data? From where? On what legal basis? Transferred to whom?”

The data subject was dissatisfied by Airbnb’s response of 27 May 2020 and communicated this to the Berlin DPA on 3 August 2020, which was then passed on to the DPC on 14 October 2020. In this, the data subject did not accept that Airbnb had erased his data and questioned why Airbnb erased his data immediately after his access request before he could review their response to it.

The DPC notified Airbnb of the data subject’s complaint from 3 August 2020 and requested a further response from Airbnb. On 9 December 2020, Airbnb responded mainly reiterating its submissions made on 27 May 2020. The DPC communicated this response from Airbnb to the data subject via the Berlin DPA on 24 March 2021. On 13 July 2021, the data subject reiterated his dissatisfaction with Airbnb’s response of 9 December 2020.

On 22 December 2022, acting in its capacity as the lead supervisory authority the DPC commenced an inquiry into the matter on the following issues:

* Issue 1: Whether Airbnb’s provision of the personal data and information concerning the processing of that personal data in response to the Complainant’s [data subject’s] access request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act [the Data Protection Act 2018]. 
* Issue 2: Whether Airbnb’s handling of the Complainant’s access request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act insofar as the information provided to the Complainant was in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. 
* Issue 3: Whether Airbnb’s handling of the Complainant’s erasure request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act.
* Issue 4(a): Whether Airbnb’s obligation to provide information on action taken in response to the access and erasure requests without undue delay pursuant to Article 12(3) GDPR was suspended until after the verification of the Complainant’s identity by phone call on 31 July 2018. 
* Issue 4(b): Whether Airbnb had a lawful basis for requesting a copy of the Complainant’s ID, and upon the Complainant’s refusal to provide same, whether Airbnb had a lawful basis to thereafter request a telephone call in order to verify the Complainant’s identity in circumstances where he had submitted a request for access and erasure pursuant to Articles 15 and 17 GDPR.

The DPC did not consider the two erasure requests made in 2015 as they were made prior to the application of the GDPR. The DPC came to a decision on the above issues on 20 July 2023.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17","1. The data subject submitted an access request and erasure request to Airbnb on 6 July 2018, invoking rights under Articles 15 and 17 GDPR.

2. Airbnb requested identity verification on 17 July 2018 by asking for a copy of the data subject's ID, which is permitted under Article 12(6) if there are reasonable doubts about identity. However, the data subject refused to provide ID, and Airbnb then proposed a phone call for verification, which was completed on 31 July 2018. While Article 12(6) allows for such requests, the time taken for verification (from 17 July to 31 July) contributed to a delay in responding to the requests.

3. Article 12(3) GDPR requires the controller to provide information on action taken without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request. The access request was received on 6 July 2018, but Airbnb provided the response on 30 August 2018, which is beyond the one-month period. No extension was communicated within one month as allowed under Article 12(3) for complexity, thus violating the timely response requirement.

4. In the access response on 30 August 2018, Airbnb provided personal data in English with incomprehensible column headings, while the data subject had communicated in German. This fails to meet the requirement of Article 12(1) for information to be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.

5. Airbnb did not provide all information required under Article 15(1) directly in response to the access request; instead, they referred the data subject to sections of their privacy policy. Article 15 mandates that the controller must provide specific information, such as purposes, categories of data, recipients, etc., which was not fully addressed in the response, violating Article 15.

6. For the erasure request under Article 17, Airbnb did not acknowledge the request in their initial response and only commenced erasure on 29 August 2018, which is more than one month after the request on 6 July 2018. Article 17 requires erasure without undue delay, and this delay, without justification, violates Article 17(1).

7. Airbnb failed to communicate effectively with the data subject regarding the status of their requests and did not provide confirmation of erasure promptly, violating the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) and the obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Article 12(2).

8. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 12(1), 12(3), 15, and 17 GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A physician recorded a patient from the hospital he worked at, on his personal telephone, and subsequently posted the video on his Facebook page. The recording took place without the patient’s consent. The physician deleted the video from his Facebook page on the same day as the one he uploaded it.

Following the submission of a complaint to the DPA, an investigation was initiated.

During its investigation, the DPA found that the physician’s recording and subsequent post on his Facebook account revealed the patient’s personal data, including their physical image, voice, name, surname and health status. The post and this information was seen by a large number of people and was also further disclosed on various websites and media channels.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by a physician, who acts as a data controller under the policy's definition (Article 4), as he determines the purposes and means of processing the patient's personal data through recording and posting on Facebook.

2. The physician processed special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), including the patient's health status (as the recording occurred in a hospital context), biometric data (physical image and voice), and potentially other sensitive data, without meeting any of the exceptions in Article 9(2). Specifically, explicit consent was not obtained (Article 9(2)(a)), and no other applicable exception (such as vital interests, public health, or legal claims) justified this processing.

3. The processing lacked a lawful basis under Article 6(1), as it was not based on consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests. The physician's actions did not fall under any of these categories, especially since the recording was done without consent and for non-medical purposes.

4. The physician violated the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing (recording and posting) was done without the patient's knowledge or consent, and was not transparent or fair to the data subject.

5. The physician failed to provide information to the data subject as required under Articles 13 and 14. Since the data was collected directly from the patient (via recording), Article 13 applies, but no information about the processing purposes, data controller, or other required details was provided at the time of data collection.

6. The physician did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default under Article 25, as using a personal telephone and posting on Facebook without safeguards exposed the data to unnecessary risks.

7. The posting of the video on Facebook, which led to further disclosure on websites and media channels, constituted a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it involved unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The physician did not notify the supervisory authority of this breach as required under Article 33, given that it likely resulted in a risk to the patient's rights and freedoms.

8. The patient's right to erasure under Article 17 was not fully respected, as although the physician deleted the video from Facebook, the data had already been disseminated to other websites and media channels, and the physician did not take reasonable steps to inform other controllers to erase the data (Article 17(2)).

9. The processing violated the patient's rights under Articles 15-22, including the right to access, rectification, and objection, as the patient was not given any opportunity to exercise these rights before or during the processing.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On the 30th of November 2020, an external phone call notified the controller about a data breach. This was initially not recognised as a security flaw, and therefore was not immediately reported further within the controller organisation.

The controller,the insurance company Moderna Försäkringar (since April 2022 Trygg-Hansa A/S), notified Swedish DPA in December 2020, that a data breach had occurred. As a result, unauthorised access to the personal data of 650,000 customers, including special categories listed in Article 9(1) GDPR, was made possible.

In March 2021, the Swedish DPA initiated an investigation to uncover whether the controller had implemented appropriate safeguards and mitigated risks to the data subject resulting from the data processing, in line with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR.

The data breach notification pertained to16 different document types, that the Swedish DPA subsequently reviewed. The documents contained multiple categories of personal data: names, contact information, health accounts, ID numbers, economic data, etc. The controller had not conducted a data protection impact assessment prior to the processing in question, which would have identified the high risk associated with it.

The investigation revealed that data breach occurred in 4 steps:

1) An existing or potential customer called customer service enquiring about an insurance offer. The customer service representative sent an SMS or email to the customer after the phone call ended.

2) This SMS or email contained a URL to an insurance offer on Trygg-Hansa’s website.

3) Trygg-Hansa's website contained additional links to documents with insurance information.

4) These documents contained URLs that were (able to be changed) on the website browser allowing access to other customers' documents.

Trygg-Hansa's backend database was therefore, accessible without requiring authentication, and anyone could browse private documents from other individuals by modifying in the URL the client ID number.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a controller, Trygg-Hansa A/S (formerly Moderna Försäkringar), processing personal data of 650,000 customers, including special categories of data such as health information, which falls under the definition of personal data and special categories under Article 4(1) and Article 9(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) and (2) of the GDPR. Specifically, the security flaw allowed URL manipulation in documents accessible via the website, enabling unauthorized access to the backend database without authentication, which constitutes a failure to protect against unauthorized access.

3. The controller did not conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) prior to the processing, as mandated by Article 35(1) and (3) of the GDPR. Given the large scale of processing and the involvement of special categories of data, the processing was likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, triggering the requirement for a DPIA.

4. The data breach resulted in unauthorized access to personal data, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR, which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access.

5. The controller's failure to identify and mitigate the security risk through adequate measures, such as authentication controls, directly contravenes the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the specific security obligations under Article 32.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 3-5 May 2022, as part of the control of marketing and profiling activities conducted by telephone companies, an inspection was directed at Tiscali Italia S.p.A. (the “Controller”).

During the investigation, the Italian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found several issues concerning, among the others, the controller’s disclosure and consent for data processing, the call back service by pop-up, the use of so-called ""soft spam"", the management of denials and objections to processing and the data retention for marketing and profiling purposes.

Following the investigation, on 23 June 2022, the controller sent a note to the DPA explaining the work carried out to address the criticisms raised. Thus, on 14 October 2022, the DPA requested further information and proof of the changes carried out.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24","1. The case involves Tiscali Italia S.p.A. as a data controller processing personal data for marketing and profiling purposes, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processing'.

2. The DPA found issues with the controller's disclosure and consent for data processing. Under Article 13, controllers must provide specific information to data subjects when collecting personal data directly from them, including purposes of processing, legal basis, data retention periods, and data subject rights. The inadequate disclosure constitutes a violation of these transparency requirements.

3. The call back service by pop-up was found noncompliant. For such processing to be lawful, it must have a valid legal basis under Article 6. If consent was used as the basis, it must meet the conditions of Article 7 and be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The investigation revealed deficiencies in obtaining proper consent.

4. The use of ""soft spam"" was identified as problematic. Under Article 130(4) of the ePrivacy Directive (as implemented in Italian law), similar provisions require that for electronic marketing communications, consent must be obtained unless the soft spam exception applies (where contact details are obtained in the context of a sale and used for similar products/services). The case shows improper application of this exception or lack of proper consent mechanisms.

5. The management of denials and objections to processing was inadequate. Article 21 gives data subjects the right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes at any time, and controllers must stop such processing immediately. The failure to properly handle objections violates this fundamental right.

6. Data retention for marketing and profiling purposes was noncompliant. Article 5(1)(e) requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes. The controller failed to implement appropriate retention periods and deletion mechanisms for marketing and profiling data.

7. Despite the controller's subsequent explanations and claimed changes, the DPA found the measures insufficient to address all violations, indicating ongoing noncompliance with multiple GDPR provisions including Articles 5, 6, 7, 13, and 21.

8. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In 2021, the Dutch and French DPAs asked the Irish DPA to provide mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 GDPR in the context of the processing activities undertaken by TikTok, the controller. The Irish DPA was Leading Supervisory Authority (LSA) under Article 56 GDPR.

TikTok allegedly processed personal data of children in lack of sufficient identification mechanisms and implementing user settings that were not private. In particular, TikTok did not identify children under the age of 13 and made social media contents of all minors public-by-default.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 60, Article 63","1. The case involves TikTok as a data controller processing personal data of children, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 3, given TikTok's establishment in the EU and its offering of services to data subjects in the Union.

2. TikTok allegedly failed to implement sufficient mechanisms to identify children under the age of 13, violating Article 8(1) GDPR, which requires that processing of personal data of children below 16 years (or lower age set by Member States, but not below 13) must be based on consent given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility.

3. TikTok made social media content of all minors public-by-default, violating Article 25(2) GDPR, which requires that by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose are processed, and that personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.

4. The public-by-default setting for minors also violates Article 5(1)(a) GDPR (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency), as it is not fair to expose children's data to wide accessibility without adequate safeguards, and Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation), as making data public exceeds what is necessary for the purposes.

5. The lack of age verification mechanisms and default public settings demonstrate insufficient protection for children's personal data, contravening Article 57(1)(a) and (b) GDPR, which tasks supervisory authorities with monitoring and enforcing the Regulation and promoting public awareness of risks.

6. The Dutch and French DPAs requested mutual assistance from the Irish DPA (as LSA) under Article 61 GDPR, which is appropriate given the cross-border nature of TikTok's processing and the need for consistent application of the GDPR.

7. The Irish DPA's role as LSA under Article 56 GDPR requires it to cooperate with other concerned supervisory authorities, and the alleged failures of TikTok indicate a breach of the GDPR's provisions on child data protection and data protection by design and by default.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 8 (child consent), Article 25 (data protection by design and by default), and Article 5 (principles of lawfulness, fairness, and data minimisation)."
"Between 8 March 2019 and 2 September 2022, the Office of the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman (DPA) received numerous complaints concerning the Finnish Business Register, a business search service provided by Suomen Avainsanat Oy (the controller).

The data subject, in particular, claimed that following a request for a call recording, the controller only a summary of the call, that did not fully reflect the previous conversation. Following a repeated request for a call recording, the controller did not provide anything.

The DPA requested clarification from the controller, who explained that it kept the recordings for 2-4 months and that at the time of the submission of the clarification, it no longer kept the recording of the calls with the data subjects.

The DPA then contacted the data subjects concerned, who agreed to close the case if the DPA conducted its own initiative investigation since numerous cases brought against one controller could be considered an indication of an established behaviour of the controller.

An investigation therefore started the scope of which was to assess the controller's general data protection practices.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a data subject making a request for access to call recordings under Article 15 of the policy, which grants data subjects the right to obtain a copy of their personal data undergoing processing.
2. The controller failed to provide the complete call recordings when requested, offering only summaries instead, which violates Article 15's requirement to provide ""a copy of the personal data undergoing processing.""
3. The controller's practice of retaining call recordings for only 2-4 months resulted in the inability to fulfill subsequent access requests, potentially violating Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation principle) if this retention period cannot be justified as necessary for the processing purposes.
4. The controller did not demonstrate compliance with Article 12(3), which requires providing information on action taken regarding data subject requests ""without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.""
5. The repeated nature of complaints suggests systemic failures in the controller's processes for handling data subject requests, violating Article 24's requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance.
6. The controller likely failed to provide proper information about data retention periods to data subjects as required by Articles 13(2)(a) and 14(2)(a) when collecting personal data, contributing to the transparency issues in this case.
7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of data subject rights and principles of data processing."
"The staff of the Danish region of Zealand had access to a health database concerning patients treated by public hospitals. The database contains names, addresses, social security numbers and health data. The Region claimed that the access by staff members was necessary to perform multidisciplinary administrative tasks and improve efficiency. The Region also stressed that staff members were subject to professional secrecy obligations.

The Danish DPA started an ex officio investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data, including health data, by the Danish region of Zealand, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing patient data.

2. The health data processed (names, addresses, social security numbers, and health information) constitutes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies.

3. The Region's justification for processing (multidisciplinary administrative tasks and efficiency) does not align with any of the specific exceptions under Article 9(2). While professional secrecy obligations exist, they do not themselves constitute a lawful basis for processing under Article 9(2), and the Region did not demonstrate that processing was necessary for reasons of substantial public interest under Union or Member State law (Article 9(2)(g)) or for health purposes under Article 9(2)(h)).

4. The processing violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as granting broad staff access to comprehensive health data exceeds what is necessary for the stated administrative purposes.

5. The processing fails to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default under Article 25, as broad staff access without necessity demonstrates insufficient safeguards for special category data.

6. The Region's reliance on professional secrecy obligations alone is insufficient to ensure compliance with Article 32's security requirements, as appropriate technical measures (e.g., access controls, encryption) are necessary to protect such sensitive data.

7. The case does not qualify for any exemption under Article 23 that would permit such processing, as the Region's efficiency claims do not override the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects.

Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The controller, the City Hall of Albeni (Gorj county, Romania) had implemented a CCTV system through which all employees of the City Hall were monitored and screened by the City Hall Mayor. The Romanian DPA opened an investigation following a complaint concerning the CCTV system.

During the investigation, it was found that the controller had failed to comply with previous measures imposed by the DPA during the course of its investigation. As a result, the DPA found violations of Articles 13, 14 and 32 GDPR.

In accordance with the provisions of Law 190/2013, in response to GDPR breaches committed by public authorities (such as the case of the City Hall), the Romanian DPA must first issue a record of findings and penalties with respect to the breach, as well as a warning, and submit a remediation plan (entailing correspondent measures and a deadline for remediation). Following the expiry of the remediation term, the Romanian DPA may resume the investigation to verify the fulfillment of the remediation measures imposed. In the current case, the Romanian DPA had submitted a remediation plan to the controller during the course of their investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 14, Article 32","1. The case involves the City Hall of Albeni (a public authority and controller under Article 4(7) GDPR) implementing a CCTV system that monitors all employees, constituting processing of personal data as defined in Article 4(2).

The Romanian DPA found violations of Article 13 (information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject) and Article 14 (information to be provided where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject), indicating the controller failed to provide employees with necessary information about the CCTV monitoring, such as the purposes of processing, legal basis, data retention periods, and data subject rights as required by these articles.

3. The DPA also found violations of Article 32 (security of processing), indicating the controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of CCTV monitoring.

4. The controller failed to comply with previous measures imposed by the DPA during the investigation, demonstrating ongoing non-compliance with GDPR requirements despite regulatory intervention.

5. Under Romanian Law 190/2013, the DPA submitted a remediation plan to the controller with specific measures and a deadline for remediation, but the case indicates the controller did not fully implement these measures, as the DPA needed to resume investigation after the remediation term expired.

6. The continued non-compliance after being given an opportunity to remediate through a formal plan demonstrates a persistent failure to meet GDPR obligations, particularly regarding transparency (Articles 13-14) and security (Article 32) requirements for processing personal data through employee monitoring.

7. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Irish DPC started an own volition inquiry into processing operations carried out by the Galway County Council (the controller), focusing mainly into the surveillance technologies deployed by state authorities, including the Galway County Council and by the An Garda Síochána (the Irish police).

More specifically, the Galway County Council Officials make use of CCTV systems, body-worn cameras and automated number plate recognition (ANPR) technologies for various purposes including law enforcement purposes. The DPC carried out its assessment both on the basis of the GDPR and of the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) for activities meant to prevent, investigate, detect and prosecute crime or for the execution of criminal penalties.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 35","1. The case involves the Galway County Council as a data controller using surveillance technologies (CCTV, body-worn cameras, and ANPR) for various purposes including law enforcement activities. According to Article 2(2)(d) of the GDPR, the Regulation does not apply to processing by competent authorities for purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences. However, the DPC's assessment covers both GDPR and LED, indicating that some processing operations fall outside strict law enforcement purposes and are subject to GDPR requirements.

2. For processing operations subject to GDPR, the controller must have a lawful basis under Article 6. The use of surveillance technologies, particularly those capturing biometric data (through CCTV and body-worn cameras), involves processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), which is generally prohibited unless specific conditions under Article 9(2) apply. The case materials do not indicate that the Council obtained explicit consent or met any of the other exceptions under Article 9(2) for processing biometric data.

3. The automated number plate recognition (ANPR) technology processes personal data (vehicle registration information) potentially on a large scale. Under Article 35(1), such processing likely requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment due to its high-risk nature, particularly when combined with other surveillance technologies. The case does not mention the completion of such assessments.

4. For all processing activities, the controller must comply with the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a). The use of surveillance technologies in public spaces requires clear signage and public information about the processing as mandated by Articles 13 and 14. The case materials suggest insufficient transparency measures regarding the purposes and legal bases of the surveillance operations.

5. The processing of personal data through these technologies must comply with the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b). The case indicates the technologies are used for ""various purposes"" including law enforcement, which may indicate purpose creep without proper justification or separate legal bases for different processing activities.

6. Where processing involves special category data (particularly biometric data from cameras), the controller must implement appropriate safeguards under Article 9(2) and demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2). The case materials do not show adequate measures to protect the fundamental rights of data subjects subjected to surveillance.

7. Therefore, based on the violations of multiple GDPR provisions including Articles 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, and 35, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The two companies in question, as controllers, made use of cookies on their websites, but failed to inform data subjects visiting their web pages about the legal basis for installing cookies and collected a combined consent for all types of cookies. Information on how to withdraw one's consent was also missing on the cookie banners.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 7, Article 13","1. The case involves two companies acting as controllers that installed cookies on their websites, which constitutes processing of personal data as defined in Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. Under Article 13(1)(c), controllers must inform data subjects about ""the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing"" at the time when personal data are obtained. The companies failed to provide information about the legal basis for installing cookies, violating this requirement.

3. Article 7(1) requires that consent be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous,"" and Article 7(2) states that ""the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters."" By collecting a combined consent for all types of cookies without allowing separate choices, the companies violated the specificity requirement for valid consent.

4. Article 7(3) explicitly states that ""the data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time"" and that ""it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent."" The absence of information on how to withdraw consent on the cookie banners constitutes a violation of this requirement.

5. As controllers, the companies are responsible for ensuring compliance with these provisions under Article 5(2) (the accountability principle) and Article 24(1) (implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures).

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 13(1)(c), Article 7(1), Article 7(2), and Article 7(3)."
"The DPA received an anonymous petition stating that EOS Matrix had unauthorized processing of a large number of personal data (of debtors). A USB stick containing 181,641 personal data of natural persons in the structure of first and last name, date of birth and OIB, who had outstanding debts to initial creditors that were purchased by EOS Matrix based on the cession agreement. Likewise, in the petition, it was stated that the database also includes 294 natural persons who were minors at the time.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32","1. The case involves EOS Matrix processing personal data of 181,641 natural persons (debtors), including first/last names, dates of birth, and OIB (a national identification number), which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the policy.

2. The processing includes data of 294 minors without evidence of lawful consent or authorization from holders of parental responsibility, violating Article 8(1) which requires consent from a parent/guardian for processing personal data of children under 16.

3. The processing of OIB (a national identification number) requires appropriate safeguards under Article 87, but no such safeguards are mentioned in the case, indicating a violation.

4. EOS Matrix processes personal data for debt collection purposes without demonstrating a lawful basis under Article 6(1) (e.g., consent, contract performance, or legitimate interests). The scale of processing (181,641 individuals) suggests a lack of proportionality and necessity under the principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)).

5. The anonymous petition reveals that the data was stored on a USB stick, indicating potential inadequate security measures under Article 32(1), which requires appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security.

6. The large-scale processing of personal data (especially sensitive financial information) likely requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(1), but no evidence suggests this was conducted.

7. The processing of minors' data without proper consent and safeguards violates the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a), as children merit specific protection due to their vulnerability.

8. The case involves processing without proper transparency measures under Articles 13-14, as data subjects were likely not informed about the processing activities, especially since the data was obtained via cession agreements rather than directly from individuals.

9. The combination of violations (lack of lawful basis, insufficient security, processing minors' data without consent, and inadequate transparency) demonstrates systemic non-compliance with multiple provisions of the policy.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In December 2019, the DSB received an anonymous submission claiming that a controller had installed GPS-trackers on its company vehicles, monitoring not only business trips but also private rides of the its employees. Further, the complaint stated that the controller would create an employee profile based on such data.

Accordingly, the DSB started an ex officio investigation under Article 57(1)(h) GDPR and obtained evidence about the following facts: the controller leased 15 company vehicles from a leasing provider and put them at its employees’ disposal for both business and private trips. In 2020, the controller asked a third party company to install a GPS-tracking device on every vehicle. Initially, this was used to determine the current location of the vehicle when asked; from July 2021 onwards, the GPS-system has also been used as a tool for keeping record of working hours, business trips and for calculating travel expenses. The device placed on the vehicles transmits data to a server and is activated by starting the car’s engine and it is deactivated as the engine stops. However, each car also includes a switch allowing the driver to deactivate the device manually. The transmitted data includes: covered distance in km, date and time, starting point, destination and location data of the vehicle (and the actual route covered). The controller has knowledge about some of this data (the address of, arrival and departure from the customers’ premises) thanks to the coordinators who organize business trips and assign them to the employees on a daily basis, hence without the need to access the data collected by the tracking devices. In order to access to the data generated by the tracking devices, one must log into a software app. The only employees who have these credentials are those responsible for payroll accounting and financial management and the coordinators.  Externally, the company that installed the devices, as a processor, also has access to such data.

The controller submitted that it is both under a legal obligation to process real-time location data of some of its employees in accordance with Article 6(1)(c) GDPR and it also has a legitimate interest to do so under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, specifically location data of employees, which falls under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) GDPR as it relates to identifiable natural persons.

2. The controller claims legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation) and Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) for processing location data. However, for continuous GPS tracking that monitors employees during both business and private trips, the processing goes beyond what is necessary for the stated purposes (working hours recording, travel expenses) and infringes on the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b).

3. The processing of location data, especially when it reveals patterns of private life activities, may involve special categories of data under Article 9(1) (e.g., religious beliefs from visits to places of worship, health data from hospital visits). The controller has not demonstrated compliance with any of the exceptions under Article 9(2) for processing such sensitive data.

4. The controller failed to provide adequate information to data subjects as required by Articles 13 and 14 GDPR. Employees were not properly informed about the extent of monitoring, including private trip tracking, the purposes of processing, or their rights regarding this data collection.

5. The manual deactivation switch does not constitute valid consent or provide a sufficient mechanism for employees to exercise control over their data, as consent must be freely given, specific, and informed under Article 7. Employees may feel compelled not to use the switch to avoid suspicion.

6. The processing violates the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) as the controller already had alternative means to track business trips through coordinators, making continuous GPS tracking disproportionate and excessive.

7. The creation of employee profiles based on tracking data likely involves automated decision-making and profiling under Article 22, without providing suitable safeguards or ensuring data subjects' rights to obtain human intervention and contest decisions.

8. The controller's legitimate interest assessment under Article 6(1)(f) fails to properly balance the interests against employees' fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly given the intrusive nature of continuous location monitoring during private time.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of multiple provisions including Articles 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, and 22."
"The DPA opened an investigation against an energy company, Restart Energy One S.A. (the controller), after receiving a complaint regarding a data breach on the company's website. A file on the controller’s website was publicly accessible, which contained personal data of at least 750 data subjects, including data relating to subjects' name, surname, address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, contract number and date whereby subjects concluded their contract with the energy company. The file was publicly accessible for two and a half years.

During its investigation, the DPA also assessed that when users accessed the website, the controller employed cookies which were unnecessary for the operation of the website. The cookies were installed before the user was given the option to consent or refuse cookies. Even in instances where the user refused cookies, they were nonetheless installed on their device, irrespective of the user’s choice.

Article 4(5) of Law 506/2004, implementing Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive, outlines how the use of an electronic communications network to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a user is allowed. One of the conditions notes that users must be offered the possibility to refuse such storage or access to information stored.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a controller (Restart Energy One S.A.) processing personal data of data subjects, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and contract details, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2(1).

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), by allowing a file containing personal data of at least 750 data subjects to be publicly accessible on its website for two and a half years.

3. The controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

4. Regarding the use of cookies, the controller installed cookies on users' devices before obtaining consent and even when users refused cookies, which violates:
   - Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive (as implemented by national law), which requires that users be offered the right to refuse storage or access to information stored on their terminal equipment.
   - The principle of lawfulness under Article 6(1), as processing without valid consent (where required) is unlawful.
   - The conditions for consent under Article 7(1), which requires that the controller be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented, and Article 7(3), which stipulates that it must be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
   - The right to object under Article 21(2), which requires that the data subject's objection to processing for direct marketing (which includes cookies used for tracking and profiling) be respected.

5. The controller's actions in installing cookies irrespective of the user's choice also violate the principle of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as users were not properly informed or given a genuine choice.

6. The prolonged period of two and a half years during which the personal data file was publicly accessible indicates a failure to adhere to the principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e), as personal data was not kept in a form permitting identification for no longer than necessary.

7. The controller did not comply with the obligation to notify a personal data breach without undue delay (and in any case within 72 hours) to the supervisory authority under Article 33(1), as the breach was discovered through a complaint rather than self-reported.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"In May 2022, the controller, a local business owner, fell victim to a data breach. A file containing the personal data of her clients was stolen from her computer. The stolen data included names, home and email addresses, telephone numbers and national identification numbers of the data subjects.

The controller informed the Polish DPA about this incident but did not reveal any details as to whether the data subjects had been informed about the data breach or whether any risk to their rights and freedoms existed as a result of it. Moreover, the controller contacted the DPA after the 72-hour period prescribed by Article 33(1) GDPR. The DPA requested clarifications but did not receive an answer.

Consequently, in September 2022 the DPA initiated an ex officio investigation regarding the controller's handling of the data breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves a controller (the local business owner) who experienced a personal data breach in May 2022, where client data including names, addresses, telephone numbers, and national identification numbers was stolen, as defined under Article 4(12) GDPR.

2. According to Article 33(1) GDPR, the controller must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The controller contacted the Polish DPA after this 72-hour period, which constitutes a violation of the notification timeline.

3. Article 33(3) GDPR requires that the notification to the supervisory authority include specific information, such as the nature of the personal data breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures taken or proposed to address it. The controller failed to provide these details, including whether data subjects were informed or whether any risk to their rights existed, which is a violation of the content requirements for breach notification.

4. Article 33(4) GDPR states that where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it must be accompanied by reasons for the delay. The controller did not provide such reasons, further violating Article 33.

5. Article 34(1) GDPR requires that when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The controller's failure to disclose whether data subjects were informed suggests a potential violation of this communication obligation.

6. Article 31 GDPR mandates that the controller and processor shall cooperate with the supervisory authority on request. The DPA requested clarifications regarding the breach, but the controller did not respond, violating the cooperation requirement.

7. The controller's actions—failing to notify within 72 hours, providing an incomplete notification, not communicating with data subjects where required, and not cooperating with the DPA—collectively demonstrate noncompliance with multiple articles of the GDPR, specifically Articles 31, 33, and 34.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Between November 2019 and January 2021, the French DPA received 31 complaints relating to ‘cold’ calls, a form of sales solicitation by phone from businesses to customers who have never interacted with the business before, and issues with the complainants’ exercise of their rights by GROUPE CANAL+ (the company), which specialises in the publishing of channels and the distribution of pay-TV offerings. Five of these complaints have been upheld in the present proceedings. Specifically, two of the complainants claimed that their right to erasure had not been complied with, and a third complainant stated that his request for an objection to the processing had also been disregarded.

Thus, in January 2021, the DPA held an online inspection of the processing operations carried out by the company, and in March 2023, a rapporteur was appointed to examine the documents.

At the end of the investigation, on 11 May 2023, the company was sent a report detailing the breaches of Article 12 GDPR, Article 13 GDPR, Article 14 GDPR, Article 15 GDPR, Article 28 GDPR, Article 32 GDPR and Article 33 GDPR, as well as of Article L. 34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code (the CPCE). Following this, the company submitted additional observations, and on 14 September 2023, the rapporteur and the company presented oral observations to the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 28, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves GROUPE CANAL+ as a data controller processing personal data through cold calls and handling data subject rights requests, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (processing of personal data by automated means).

2. The company failed to respond to data subject requests (including right to erasure and right to object) within the one-month timeframe specified in Article 12(3), violating the requirement to provide information on action taken without undue delay.

3. For data collected directly from data subjects (through cold calls), the company failed to provide all required information under Article 13 at the time of data collection, including: the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, data retention periods, and data subject rights.

4. For data not obtained from data subjects, the company failed to provide the information required under Article 14 within a reasonable period, including: the categories of personal data concerned, the source of the data, and the appropriate safeguards for data subjects' rights.

5. The company violated Article 15 by failing to provide complete information in response to access requests, including: purposes of processing, categories of personal data, recipients of data, and storage periods.

6. The company failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing as required by Article 32(1), including pseudonymization and encryption of personal data, and measures to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems.

7. The company violated Article 33 by failing to notify personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay and not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of them, where such breaches were likely to result in a risk to data subjects' rights.

8. The company violated Article 28 by failing to use processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, and by not having a contract or other legal act binding the processor to the controller.

9. The company's cold calling activities violated Article L. 34-5 of the French CPCE, which implements the GDPR's requirements for lawful processing of personal data for marketing purposes, particularly regarding consent requirements for unsolicited communications.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"On 3 April 2023, the applicant requested the local Police Station (the controller) to delete from its website the information concerning her disappearance, as well as from the websites of the media outlets that had picked up the news from the police website.

In a reply dated 6 April 2023, the controller explained that her requests could not be granted because they were not responsible for the content and its deletion from the other online portals.

Thus, the applicant filed a complaint to the Slovenian DPA against the controller, and the DPA then began its proceedings by conducting two calls with the controller.

The controller confirmed to the DPA that it had removed the applicant's data from its website since its publication was no longer necessary for the purpose of the search for this person. It further explained to have ensured compliance, after the proceedings started, by also communicating to all media outlets that still had news of the applicant's disappearance published online that the applicant had requested the deletion of her personal data. In the notification, the controller had explained to the media outlets that this was a submission of an erasure request, which they had to comply with in accordance with the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 17,"1. The case involves a data subject (the applicant) exercising her right to erasure under Article 17 of the GDPR against the local Police Station (the controller) regarding personal data (information about her disappearance) that was published on the controller's website and subsequently disseminated by media outlets.

2. The controller initially failed to fulfill its obligation under Article 17(2) of the GDPR, which requires that where a controller has made personal data public and is obliged to erase it, the controller must take reasonable steps to inform other controllers processing the data that the data subject has requested the erasure of any links to, or copies or replications of, that data.

3. The controller's initial reply, stating it was ""not responsible for the content and its deletion from the other online portals,"" demonstrates a failure to understand and act upon this specific obligation under Article 17(2) to inform other controllers (the media outlets).

4. The controller's subsequent action of notifying media outlets only after the intervention of the Slovenian DPA and the initiation of proceedings indicates that the initial response was noncompliant. Compliance with Article 17(2) requires proactive measures by the controller upon receiving a valid erasure request, not reactive measures taken under pressure from a supervisory authority.

5. Furthermore, Article 19 of the GDPR stipulates that the controller must communicate any erasure of personal data to each recipient to whom the data was disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller's initial failure to notify the media outlets constitutes a violation of this communication obligation.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy, as the controller failed to meet its obligations under Articles 17(2) and 19 of the GDPR in its initial handling of the data subject's erasure request."
"Following a visit to the premises of two public bodies (the joint controllers), the agents of the Luxembourgish DPA found that the controllers applied a geo-localisation system on the companies' service vehicles and construction machines. Even though the system was not connected to the drivers, through the timesheets, which indicated which driver used which vehicle or machine, it was easy to find out which employee used which vehicle on which day.

On 13 December 2022, at the end of the investigation, a statement of objection was published by the rapporteur detailing breaches of Article 13 GDPR, Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. Following this, the joint controllers submitted observations, and on 13 June 2023, the rapporteur and the joint controllers presented oral observations to the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves two public bodies acting as joint controllers, processing personal data of employees through a geo-localization system on service vehicles and construction machines, as per the definition of controllers in Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The geo-localization system collects location data of the vehicles and machines, which constitutes personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR, as it relates to identifiable natural persons when combined with timesheets that indicate which employee used which vehicle on which day.

3. Article 13 of the GDPR requires controllers to provide specific information to data subjects when personal data is collected from them, including the purposes of processing, the legal basis, and other details. The Luxembourgish DPA found a breach of Article 13, indicating that the joint controllers failed to provide this necessary information to the employees whose data was processed.

4. Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR stipulates the principle of purpose limitation, meaning personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in an incompatible manner. The DPA found a breach of this article, suggesting that the geo-localization data may have been used for purposes beyond what was communicated or intended, such as employee monitoring without proper justification.

5. Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR requires data minimization, meaning personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes. The DPA found a breach here, indicating that the collection of detailed location data through the geo-localization system, especially when linkable to individual employees via timesheets, exceeded what was necessary for legitimate purposes like vehicle management.

6. The processing of location data that can track employees' movements raises concerns under Article 6 (lawfulness of processing) and Article 9 (processing of special categories of data, though not directly cited, but location data could be sensitive), but the specific breaches cited are under Article 13 and Article 5.

7. Based on the breaches of Article 13, Article 5(1)(b), and Article 5(1)(c) as confirmed by the DPA, the joint controllers failed to comply with multiple provisions of the GDPR.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Romanian DPA initiated an investigation following the receiving of a complaint, investigation which was finalized in October 2023. During the investigation, the DPA found that personal data pertaining to a petitioner were sent by e-mail to another individual. The DPA considered that the controller did not adopt sufficient security measures in accordance with Article 32 GDPR, situation which led to the occurrence of a data breach which affected the personal data of the petitioner.  Also, the DPA found that the financial institution failed to notify the respective data breach to the DPA, in violation of Article 33 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves a financial institution (controller) that processed personal data of a petitioner, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 3, given the establishment in the EU and processing activities related to individuals in the Union.

2. The controller sent personal data via email to another individual without sufficient security measures, resulting in a data breach. Article 32 GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized disclosure or access.

3. The Romanian DPA found that the controller failed to adopt sufficient security measures, which constitutes a violation of Article 32 GDPR, as the email transmission did not ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the personal data, leading to unauthorized disclosure.

4. Additionally, the controller did not notify the data breach to the DPA, which violates Article 33 GDPR. Article 33(1) mandates that controllers must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons.

5. The breach involved unauthorized disclosure of personal data via email, which likely presented a risk to the petitioner's rights and freedoms, thus triggering the notification obligation under Article 33. The controller's failure to notify exacerbates the violation.

6. The case also implicates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing. The email incident demonstrates a breach of this principle.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 32 (security of processing) and Article 33 (notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority)."
"The Romanian DPA started an investigation against a controller (a car sharing company), after one of the controller's customers filed a complaint. The data subject reported to the authority that they received several unsolicited marketing communications, even after they submitted a data deletion request with the controller, request which was acknowledged and confirmed by the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 17","1. The case involves a controller (car sharing company) processing personal data of a data subject (customer), as defined in Article 4 of the policy, where 'controller' means the natural or legal person that determines the purposes and means of processing, and 'data subject' is an identifiable natural person.

2. The data subject submitted a data deletion request to the controller, which was acknowledged and confirmed by the controller. This request relates to the right to erasure under Article 17 of the policy.

3. Article 17(1) of the policy requires the controller to erase personal data without undue delay when one of the grounds applies, such as when the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based and there is no other legal ground (Article 17(1)(b)), or when the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) (Article 17(1)(c)).

4. The data subject reported receiving unsolicited marketing communications after the deletion request, indicating that personal data were still being processed for direct marketing purposes. Processing for direct marketing falls under Article 21(2) of the policy, which states that where personal data are processed for direct marketing, the data subject has the right to object at any time, and upon objection, the personal data must no longer be processed for such purposes.

5. The controller's failure to cease marketing communications after the data deletion request constitutes a violation of Article 21(2), as the request should be treated as an objection to processing for direct marketing.

6. Additionally, under Article 12(3) of the policy, the controller must provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15-22 without undue delay and within one month. While the controller acknowledged the request, it did not take appropriate action to stop the processing, thereby violating this article.

7. The continued processing for marketing purposes after the deletion request also suggests that the controller did not properly erase the data as required by Article 17(1), leading to a violation of that article.

8. Therefore, the controller's actions are noncompliant with multiple provisions of the policy, including Article 17(1), Article 21(2), and Article 12(3).

"The Danish company Mindworking A/S offers an all-in-one platform for the real estate industry, acting as a processor. On 4 November 2021, the real estate agent notified the processor about a security flaw in the platform (dating back to when the platform was launched in 2019), which had been flagged through an anonymous tip by a customer.

Through developer tools, users could view confidential data in the webpage source code, including personal data such as real estate agents' personal notes, names of potential buyers, price offers and contracts. The processor could not rule out that some documents contained social security numbers. To access the data, though, users had to create an account, be logged into the platform and have access to a specific case.

The processor investigated the error and fixed it the same day, on 4 November 2021. It stated that the incident was caused by a security error it was not aware of, which is why no technical or organisational measures had been preventively taken to prevent this issue.

Between 8 and 12 November 2021, the Danish DPA received personal data breach reports from 65 controllers who used the platform provided by the processor. On 11 November, after an initial dialogue with the DPA, the processor itself reported the data breach to the DPA. The DPA then launched an independent investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves Mindworking A/S acting as a processor for real estate agents (controllers) under GDPR definitions (Article 4(8)), processing personal data including names, offers, contracts, and potentially social security numbers (Article 4(1)).

2. The processor failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). The security flaw allowing unauthorized access to confidential data via developer tools had existed since the platform's launch in 2019, indicating insufficient security measures.

3. The processor violated Article 28(1) by failing to provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to meet GDPR requirements. The inability to prevent this security error demonstrates inadequate safeguards.

4. The processor violated the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) by being unable to demonstrate compliance with GDPR security requirements, as they were unaware of the security flaw and had no preventive measures in place.

5. The processor failed to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of the personal data breach, as required by Article 33(2). The real estate agent notified the processor on November 4, 2021, but the processor only reported to the DPA on November 11, 2021, after controllers had already reported the breach.

6. The breach involved potential access to special categories of data (social security numbers), which requires enhanced protection under Article 9, but the processor failed to implement adequate safeguards for such sensitive data.

7. The processor violated data protection by design and by default requirements (Article 25) by not implementing appropriate technical measures at the time of the platform's development to prevent unauthorized access to personal data through developer tools.

8. The DPA's investigation confirmed these violations, leading to the determination of noncompliance with GDPR requirements regarding processor obligations, security measures, and breach notification procedures.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A Danish citizen lodged a complaint with the Danish DPA regarding the Danish Agency for Digital Government's (the controller) processing of his personal data in their Driving Licence app, which he had not registered for or used.

The app is a digital alternative to the physical driving licence and contains information about the licence holder's name, birth data, place of birth, nationality, licence number, passport number, passport photo, social security number, health, and data relating to criminal convictions and offences.

Following the complaint, on 7 September 2022, the DPA started an own-volition investigation of the matter. They found that the controller was processing the personal data of approximately 3.96 million Danish citizens with a driving licence, yet only 1.7 million had registered for the app, while the remaining group had not joined the app.

The controller attributed the excessive processing to technical constraints of the driving licence database, built on an outdated mainframe system, which gave it access to all valid Danish driving licenses. They explained to have initially considered three possible solutions for the app but deemed only the one adopted realistically viable. The one adopted complied with certain operational and performance requirements while allowing for the digital driving licence, updated with the latest information, to be made accessible to citizens. Consequently, they claimed that the processing was in line with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 58","1. The case involves the Danish Agency for Digital Government as a controller processing personal data of approximately 3.96 million Danish citizens through their Driving Licence app, including special categories of data such as health data and data relating to criminal convictions (Article 4 definitions of 'controller', 'processing', and 'special categories of data' under Article 9).

2. The controller processed personal data of individuals who had not registered for or used the app (approximately 2.26 million citizens), thereby processing data beyond what was necessary for the specific purpose of providing a digital driving licence service to registered users.

3. Article 5(1)(c) GDPR requires that personal data be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimisation')"". The processing of data from non-users who had not consented to or requested the service violates this principle, as their data was not necessary for the app's functionality.

4. Article 6 GDPR requires a lawful basis for processing. For non-users who had not consented, no lawful basis existed since: a) consent was not obtained (Article 6(1)(a)); b) processing was not necessary for performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b)) as no contract existed with non-users; c) the controller's claim of technical constraints does not constitute a valid legal basis under Article 6.

5. Article 10 requires that processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences must be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by law with appropriate safeguards. The blanket processing of such sensitive data without user-specific authorization violates this provision.

6. The controller's justification based on technical constraints of their outdated mainframe system does not override the fundamental principles of data minimization and purpose limitation under Article 5, nor does it provide a lawful basis for processing under Article 6.

7. The processing of special category data (health data under Article 9 and criminal conviction data under Article 10) without the explicit consent of data subjects or other valid exception under Article 9(2) constitutes an additional violation.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to violations of the principles of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), lawful basis requirements (Article 6), and special protections for sensitive data (Articles 9 and 10)."
"Between 27 July 2021 and 3 January 2022, Rompetrol Downstream SRL (the controller) notified the Romanian DPA of several data breaches, in accordance with Article 33 GDPR. Following these notifications, the DPA opened an investigation against the controller.

During the investigation, the DPA found that customer data from the company's own software had been repeatedly accessed by the staff and used in an unauthorised manner. Moreover, the personal data of customers was disclosed for the purpose of obtaining loans in the data subject's name.

As a result of the data breach, personal data pertaining to controller’s customer data including data from the identity card (name, surname, series and number of the identity card, personal numerical code, address, place of birth, photo) and income statements (among the others,  name and surname of the employee, date, signature, income achieved, length of service) were unlawfully accessed and further disclosed for the above mentioned illicit purposes.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Rompetrol Downstream SRL as a data controller processing personal data of customers, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing involves automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller notified multiple data breaches to the Romanian DPA between July 2021 and January 2022, fulfilling their obligation under Article 33(1) to report personal data breaches without undue delay.

3. The investigation revealed that customer data including identity card information (name, surname, series and number of identity card, personal numerical code, address, place of birth, photo) and income statements were unlawfully accessed by staff and used for unauthorized purposes, specifically for obtaining loans in the data subjects' names.

4. This unauthorized processing violates Article 5(1)(a) which requires personal data to be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, as the data subjects were not aware of this specific purpose and did not provide consent for such processing.

5. The processing of special categories of personal data (including identity card numbers and personal numerical codes which could reveal racial or ethnic origin, and potentially other sensitive data) without a lawful basis under Article 9 constitutes a violation, as none of the exceptions in Article 9(2) appear to apply to this unauthorized processing.

6. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), given that staff were able to repeatedly access and misuse customer data for unauthorized purposes.

7. The controller violated Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle) by failing to protect personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

8. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they were unable to prevent multiple instances of unauthorized access and misuse of personal data by their staff.

9. The unauthorized disclosure of personal data to third parties for obtaining loans violated Article 6, as there was no lawful basis for this processing, and likely violated Article 13 which requires transparency about the purposes of processing.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Mrs XX, the party in this proceeding, installed a surveillance system on the external wall of her property. According to the Carabinieri station which reported to the DPA on 6th of July 2021, the surveillance system in question was capable of recording the public area in front of the party’s property, including a nearby playground and a public square.

Pursuant to to art. 157 of Legislative Decree no. 196 of 2003, containing the Code regarding the protection of personal data, the DPA opened a preliminary investigation.


During the investigation, carried out on 2 March 2023, the officers noted that the video surveillance system was made up of  two recording devices. First, pan-and-tilt camera that was active and it had the following features: possibility of 360° movement with capability to record images as well as audio and to speak through the microphone. The camera was positioned right above the entrance door. The party controlled the camera through the smartphone application. The second camera was connected but not active, and it was looking over the driveway that leads to the the entrance of the building. The party controlled the camera through the smartphone application.

In relation to the viewing angle of the cameras, the party declared that the system that records external images films the portion of the space in front the entrance and the immediately adjacent areas. She added that the camera which is positioned immediately above the access door, due to its characteristics, could also frame part of the playground, but it was not in her interest to do so. The purpose of the video surveillance was to confront the alleged threats that the party received.

Subsequently, the party took measures to bring the aforementioned processing in compliance with GDPR including replacing the pan-and-tilt camera with a fixed camera model pointed only towards the entrance of her property.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 58","1. The case involves Mrs. XX as a data controller processing personal data through a video surveillance system, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it constitutes automated processing of personal data (images and audio of identifiable individuals).

2. The processing of personal data through video surveillance must comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), and integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)).

3. The pan-and-tilt camera was capable of recording audio, which constitutes processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), as it could capture conversations revealing potentially sensitive information. Such processing requires explicit consent or another exception under Article 9(2), which was not obtained or demonstrated in this case.

4. The camera's 360° movement capability and positioning allowed it to record a public playground and square, exceeding what is necessary for the stated purpose of security (confronting threats). This violates the data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c)), as it collected more personal data than needed.

5. Recording public areas where individuals (including children) have a reasonable expectation of privacy without adequate justification violates the fairness principle (Article 5(1)(a)), as it disproportionately infringes on the rights of data subjects.

6. The controller failed to provide appropriate information to data subjects about the processing as required by Articles 12 and 13, particularly regarding audio recording and the extent of monitoring, which undermines transparency.

7. While Mrs. XX later replaced the camera to limit the viewing angle, this corrective action does not remedy the prior period of noncompliant processing that occurred during the investigation.

8. The Italian DPA (Garante) found that the initial setup violated multiple GDPR principles, leading to the NONCOMPLIANT verdict based on the facts established during their investigation.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 9 November 2021, the DPA ordered the controller (Suomen Asiakastieto Oy, a consumer credit information service provider) to rectify its practices in registering payment default entries based on final decisions and to erase all incorrect payment default entries which had resulted from such practices. The controller was also ordered to submit a report of the measures which it had taken due to the order and to report the number of erased payment default entries to the DPA.

In its first report, the controller stated that it had changed its practice but argued that it was practically impossible for it to find and erase the entries related to disputed cases from its register retrospectively, since it had not been informed by the Legal Register Centre of which decisions had been delivered to it on inaccurate grounds.

In its second report, the controller stated that it had interpreted the DPA's order incorrectly and had now erased all payment default entries based on final decisions from its register. According to the controller, it was unclear whether the order only concerned the erasure of the payment default entries of the data subject who initiated the case or the erasure of all incorrect payment default entries.

The controller argued that it would be impossible to re-read all the decisions handed over to it, to re-evaluate the registration eligibility of each decision, assess whether the matter is possibly registered as a payment default entry and, if necessary, erase the entry after this assessment.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 83,"1. The case involves a controller (Suomen Asiakastieto Oy) processing personal data related to payment defaults, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and constitutes processing of personal data as defined in Article 4.

2. The controller was ordered by the DPA (supervisory authority) to rectify its practices and erase incorrect payment default entries, which relates to the data subject's right to rectification under Article 16 and right to erasure ('right to be forgotten') under Article 17 when personal data are inaccurate or unlawfully processed.

3. The controller argued that it was ""practically impossible"" to find and erase the incorrect entries retrospectively, claiming it hadn't been informed which decisions were inaccurate and that re-evaluating all decisions would be overly burdensome.

4. Under Article 5(1)(d), personal data must be ""accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date,"" and the controller has an ongoing obligation under the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) to demonstrate compliance with this accuracy principle.

5. Article 17(1) requires that the controller erase personal data without undue delay when the data are inaccurate, and Article 19 requires the controller to communicate any erasure to each recipient to whom the data have been disclosed.

6. The controller's claim of practical impossibility does not absolve it of its obligations under the GDPR. Article 11(2) states that where the controller is not in a position to identify the data subject, Articles 15-20 shall not apply except where the data subject provides additional information enabling identification. However, in this case, the controller was specifically ordered by the DPA to erase incorrect entries and should have maintained adequate systems to comply with such obligations.

7. The DPA's order was issued under its corrective powers per Article 58(2), which the controller is obligated to follow. The controller's failure to fully implement the order constitutes non-compliance with the lawful instructions of a supervisory authority.

8. The controller's argument that it would be impossible to re-evaluate all decisions contradicts the GDPR's principle of data protection by design and by default (Article 25), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure compliance with the Regulation.

9. Therefore, the case demonstrates non-compliance with multiple GDPR provisions including Article 5(1)(d) (accuracy principle), Article 16 (right to rectification), Article 17 (right to erasure), Article 19 (notification obligation), and Article 25 (data protection by design and by default), as well as the controller's failure to comply with the DPA's lawful order under Article 58(2).

10. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Data controller had his premises under video surveillance, there was a notice of video surveillance, but it was not placed in a way that would make it for an individual possible to be informed about the surveillance before entering the premises and to decide to not be in the area of video surveillance. 

The national data privacy legislation (Zakon o varstvu osebnih podatko - ZVOP-2) regulates in Article 76(3) ZVOP-2 the provisions of a notice in the case of video surveillance, the controller must ensure that the notice includes information required upon Article 13 GDPR and also a written or unambiguous graphic description of the fact that video surveillance is being carried out, the purposes of the processing, the name of the controller of the video surveillance system, a telephone number or an e-mail address or a website address to exercise the data subject's rights in the field of the protection of personal data, information on the specific impact of the processing, in particular further processing, the contact details of the authorized person (telephone number or e-mail address) and information about unusual further processing, such as transfers to third country entities, live monitoring and the possibility of audio intervention in case of live monitoring.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 13,"1. The case involves a data controller using video surveillance on their premises, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR, as it involves the collection and recording of individuals' images.

2. Article 13(1) of the GDPR requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject (here, through video surveillance), the controller must provide specific information at the time the data is obtained, including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, and other details necessary for fair and transparent processing.

3. Article 12(1) specifies that the controller must take appropriate measures to provide this information in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, and that it should be provided at the time of data collection.

4. The national legislation (ZVOP-2 Article 76(3)) further specifies that for video surveillance, the notice must include additional details such as a graphic description of the surveillance, purposes, controller's name, contact information for exercising rights, and information about unusual processing like live monitoring or transfers.

5. In this case, while a notice of video surveillance exists, it was not placed in a way that allows an individual to be informed before entering the premises and to decide not to be under surveillance. This violates the requirement under Article 13(1) to provide information at the time of data collection, as individuals are not informed until after they have entered the surveilled area.

6. The failure to provide accessible notice before data collection also contravenes Article 12(1), as the information is not easily accessible or provided in a manner that ensures transparency at the crucial moment when the data subject can exercise choice.

7. Additionally, the national law (ZVOP-2 Article 76(3)) reinforces these GDPR requirements by mandating specific content for video surveillance notices, and the controller's failure to place the notice appropriately means these specific national provisions are also not met.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR and the national implementing legislation, as the controller did not fulfill the obligations for transparent information provision at the time of data collection."
"Östersund has twenty-four schools that use Google Workspace since 2020. It is employed for communicating, teaching, and assigning and turning in homework. Google Workspace processed the personal data of 1,303 employees and 5,945 students, including names, email addresses, and class and group memberships. The Childrens and Education Board of the muncipality of Östersund is the data controller for the processing of personal data when the schools use Google Workspace.

In 2014 an impact assesment was conducted for google apps education. It was",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 35,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data of students and employees by the Childrens and Education Board of Östersund (the controller) using Google Workspace (a processor), which includes transfers of personal data to Google in the United States, a third country without an adequacy decision under Article 45.

2. The controller is required to ensure that any transfer of personal data to a third country complies with Chapter V of the GDPR (Article 44). The case does not mention the use of any appropriate safeguards as listed in Article 46, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which are necessary for such transfers in the absence of an adequacy decision.

3. The controller must maintain records of processing activities under Article 30, including details of transfers to third countries and the documentation of suitable safeguards. The case does not indicate that such records were properly maintained or that appropriate safeguards were implemented for the data transfers to Google in the U.S.

4. The impact assessment conducted in 2014 for Google Apps Education is outdated and does not account for the legal developments since then, including the invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield by the Schrems II ruling (CJEU Case C-311/18). This failure to conduct a current data protection impact assessment (DPIA) under Article 35, particularly for processing that involves large-scale systematic monitoring or transfers to third countries, constitutes a violation.

5. The controller must ensure that processing by a processor (Google) is governed by a contract or other legal act that meets the requirements of Article 28, including stipulations that the processor provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. The case does not demonstrate that such a contract was in place or that Google's compliance with GDPR was verified.

6. The processing involves personal data of children, which requires special protection under Article 8 and Recital 38. The controller must ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, but the use of Google Workspace without ensuring compliant data transfers and processing arrangements fails to provide these safeguards.

7. The controller has an obligation to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25, and to ensure the security of processing under Article 32. The case does not show that these principles were adhered to, particularly in the context of international data transfers.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to inadequate safeguards for international data transfers, lack of a current DPIA, insufficient contractual arrangements with the processor, and failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data."
"A Danish citizen brought a complaint to the Danish DPA concerning a picture of themselves being published on the Instagram account of Aarhus University Hospital (AUH). Based on this, on 19 December 2022, the DPA initiated an investigation against the Central Denmark Region (the controller).

During the investigation, the DPA found that the Instagram account regularly published photos and videos of daily life at AUH. It showed pictures of patients, staff and relatives, and the account has been active since June 2015; it had more than 15,000 followers and more than 1,400 posts. A review of the account also revealed that there were posts with pictures and information about patients dating back to 2016. In some cases, these included information on health conditions.

The controller explained that the information on the account is published to inform the outside world about the hospital’s activities and daily life. It further clarified that posts containing information about citizens, including patients, were published on the basis of consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR. Consent was obtained in writing before the publication of the post, and granting it or not did not affect the health treatment offered to the patient. The controller also stated that its processing met the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, as well as the principle of data minimisation pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, since they did not process personal data not necessary for the hospital purposes. To limit this, they also ensured that information such as social security numbers and names were be displayed on monitors, medical records and patient wristbands appearing in the pictures. Lastly, the controller claimed to observe also the principle of storage limitation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR since data subjects could make erasure requests.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, including special categories of data (health information), by the Central Denmark Region as the controller, through publication on Instagram, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of personal data and processing).

2. The controller relies on consent under Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) for processing personal data and health data. However, for consent to be valid, it must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous as per Article 4(11) and Article 7.

3. In the healthcare context, there is an inherent power imbalance between patients and the hospital, which may affect the freedom of consent. Article 7(4) states that when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether the performance of a contract is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for that contract. Although the controller claims that consent does not affect treatment, the dependency of patients on healthcare providers can imply pressure, making consent not freely given.

4. The processing includes publication of health data on social media, which is a special category under Article 9(1). Article 9(2)(a) requires explicit consent, but the context suggests that consent may not be valid due to the lack of freeness, as supported by guidelines from the European Data Protection Board on consent in vulnerable situations.

5. The principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary. Publishing photos and health information on Instagram for informational purposes may not be necessary for the hospital's core functions, thus violating data minimisation.

6. The principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) requires that personal data be kept no longer than necessary. The controller's reliance on data subjects to request erasure shifts the burden away from the controller's proactive obligation to ensure storage limitation, which is not compliant.

7. The principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) requires that processing be fair and transparent. Publication on social media with a large audience (over 15,000 followers) may not have been sufficiently explained to data subjects, especially regarding the extent of dissemination, potentially violating transparency requirements under Articles 13 and 14.

8. The Danish DPA investigation found that the processing was noncompliant, indicating that the consent obtained was invalid and that the processing violated GDPR principles, leading to the verdict of NONCOMPLIANT.

9. Therefore, based on the violations of GDPR principles, including invalid consent, data minimisation, storage limitation, and transparency, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 20 January 2022, the Danish DPA received an inquiry from a citizen about the Agency for Digital Government’s (the controller) use of JavaScript, a programming language, in connection with MitID, the Danish digital ID. In general, the inquiry stated that JavaScript is outdated and not safe and that devices can easily be hacked if JavaScript is enabled, as highlighted by leading security experts for many years.

The DPA decided to further investigate the issue and requested the controller to present statements regarding the processing in question. The controller explained that it conducted a risk assessment of MitID and identified relevant risks, including overall risks related to code quality, which JavaScript falls under. However, it stated it did not assess possible risks to the rights of the data subjects when using specifically JavaScript. Nonetheless, it clarified to have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a sufficient level of security to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Regarding this processing, the controller also clarified that many security requirements have been set to ensure that the system is secure and updated at all times. Finally, the controller noted that in 2013 it assessed the usage of JavaScript for NemID (the old eID, replaced by MitID) and found that a JavaScript solution would have always provided high security levels.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves the Agency for Digital Government (the controller) processing personal data through the MitID system using JavaScript, which falls under the scope of GDPR as it involves processing of personal data (Article 4, definitions of 'processing' and 'personal data').

2. The controller conducted a risk assessment of MitID but specifically stated it ""did not assess possible risks to the rights of the data subjects when using specifically JavaScript,"" which violates Article 32(1) requiring controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art and the risks posed by processing.

3. The controller's reliance on a 2013 assessment of JavaScript for NemID (the previous system) without conducting a current assessment specific to MitID fails to meet the requirement of Article 32(1) to account for the state of the art and evolving risks, as technology and security threats change over time.

4. The controller's general reference to having ""implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures"" without demonstrating specific measures addressing JavaScript-related risks violates Article 32(2), which requires controllers to take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under their authority who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions.

5. The failure to conduct a specific risk assessment for JavaScript also contravenes Article 25(1) on data protection by design and by default, which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose are processed.

6. The Danish DPA's investigation revealed that JavaScript is considered outdated and unsafe by security experts, indicating potential risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms that the controller failed to properly assess and mitigate, violating the general principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to the controller's failure to conduct a proper risk assessment specific to JavaScript, implement appropriate security measures addressing known risks, and ensure ongoing compliance with state-of-the-art security requirements."
"A data subject had tried to deny direct marketing carried out by a telecommunications company (the controller), but there was no direct way to do this in the direct marketing message they had received. The data subject also had difficulties finding the contact information of the data protection officer on the controller's website.

According to the controller, direct marketing could have been denied in two ways: by contacting customer service or by creating an account in the online service. The contact information of the data protection officer, on the other hand, could have been found on the controller's website, layered behind three separate pages. In addition, the data subject could have called the controller's switchboard and asked to be connected to the data protection officer.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 21, Article 58","1. The case involves a data subject attempting to exercise their right to object to direct marketing under Article 21(2) of the policy, which states that data subjects have the right to object at any time to processing for direct marketing purposes, and that personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes upon objection.

2. The controller failed to provide a direct mechanism to object to direct marketing in the marketing communication itself, violating Article 21(2)'s requirement that the right to object be explicitly brought to the data subject's attention at the latest at the time of first communication and presented clearly and separately from any other information.

3. The controller's proposed alternatives (contacting customer service or creating an online account) impose additional burdens on the data subject that are not permitted under Article 12(2), which requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and not refuse to act on requests unless they can demonstrate they are not in a position to identify the data subject.

4. Regarding the data protection officer's contact information, Article 37(7) requires controllers to publish the DPO's contact details and communicate them to the supervisory authority. The information being layered behind three separate pages on the website violates Article 12(1)'s requirement that information be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.

5. The requirement to call a general switchboard and ask to be connected to the DPO further violates the accessibility requirements under Article 12(1), as it creates unnecessary steps and barriers for the data subject seeking to contact the DPO directly.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 12(1), Article 12(2), Article 21(2), and Article 37(7)."
"""NAV"", the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, is a government agency that collaborates with local municipalities to provide a unified access to public labor and welfare services. Its primary functions include promoting employment and ensuring financial and social security. NAV administers a significant portion of the state budget and is one of the country's largest employers with about 22,000 employees. Almost all citizens of Norway are in contact with NAV at some point of their life.

On 1 March 2023, the Norwegian DPA Datatilsynet notified NAV (the controller) of a physical inspection as per Article 57(1)(a) GDPR, Article 57(1)(h) GDPR, cf. Article 58(1)(a) GDPR, Article 58(1)(b) GDPR, Article 58(1)(e) GDPR and Article 58(1)(f) GDPR.

The DPA conducted their inspection on 6 September. They focused on the controller's IT systems for processing personal data related to their government-related services, including technical and organisational measures related to access controls, logging and log control, as per Article 32 GDPR and Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, including if the controller had established an appropriate management system in line with Article 24 GDPR and Article 5(2) GDPR.

The DPA sent the controller the preliminary audit report on 1 November, to which the controller responded on 22 November. The DPA then submitted their final report on 27 November, along with a notification of their intent to impose a fine and issue several orders.

The controller has three weeks to respond to the DPA's preliminary conclusions, after which the DPA will make their final decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32, Article 57, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves NAV (the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration) as a data controller processing personal data of Norwegian citizens, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3 since NAV is established in Norway (an EU/EEA member state) and processes personal data in the context of its activities.

2. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) conducted an inspection focusing on NAV's compliance with technical and organisational measures for security of processing under Article 32 GDPR and the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

3. According to the final report, NAV failed to implement adequate access controls to personal data in their IT systems, violating Article 32(1) GDPR which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems.

4. The inspection revealed that NAV lacked sufficient logging and log control mechanisms for access to personal data, particularly for sensitive categories of data, failing to meet the requirements of Article 32(1)(b) GDPR which mandates the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services.

5. NAV's inadequate access controls and logging procedures also violated the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

6. The DPA found that NAV had not established an appropriate data protection management system as required by Article 24 GDPR, which mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with GDPR.

7. NAV's failure to implement proper security measures also violated the accountability principle under Article 5(2) GDPR, which requires controllers to be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, all data protection principles including security.

8. The deficiencies identified by the DPA - particularly regarding access controls and logging for sensitive personal data - were especially serious given the large scale of processing operations at NAV (affecting almost all Norwegian citizens) and the sensitive nature of welfare and employment data, which likely includes special categories of data under Article 9 GDPR.

9. Based on the violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 24, and 32 GDPR identified in the DPA's inspection, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR requirements for data security and accountability."
"The Icelandic DPA initiated an ex officio investigation aimed at assessing the use of Google cloud solutions and Google Workspace for education in elementary schools in five municipalities in Iceland. This summary refers to the inquiry into the use of Google’s systems in primary schools of the city of R.
On 25 February 2022, the DPA sent a questionnaire to the city of R., and carried out its assessment based on the answers and following documents produced by the city of R:
A so-called “processing file”, containing all relevant information about the data being processed in Google’s student system. Among others, almost every service included students’ names and e-mail addresses and additional information about their parents or social security numbers that can be added by the students. 
Secondly, this included a data protection impact assessment, dated 13 June 2022. In the DPIA, the city of R stated that the goal of using Google’s systems in schools was that of supporting the academic progress of students, meet their needs, allowing them to participate in school activities remotely, making project collaboration possible and others. The DPIA also clarifies that processing that falls outside the scope of the core processing activities would be omitted as far as possible. Further, it specifies that Google processes service data in the operation and management of the cloud solution including payments, settings, technical details and direct communications. With respects to data retention and deletion of personal data, the DPIA states that most data is retained for the whole school year and that teachers are encouraged to delete data. With respect to the relationship with Google, the DPIA specifies that a processing agreement was in place and it contained instructions in compliance with Article 28(3) GDPR. It could thus be concluded from the DPIA that the City of R had taken adequate measures to mitigate the risks to rights and freedoms of primary school students. The DPIA was then updated in September 2022, addressing also risks related to the transfer of personal data to third countries.
Thirdly, the City of R attached the data processing agreement among the documents. The agreement between the city of R and Google stipulated that the city of R is the controller and Google the processor. In some instances, however, the city could also be the processor and Google the sub-processor, when ….
The agreement also states that the controller instructs the processor on the processing of personal data, but this is limited to certain cases. Further, it contains provisions on the security of processing, transfers of personal data and other obligations. 
Google’s terms specify the information that google is provided with by the controller and information that google collects itself, either information that is added by users or device, log and location information based on the use of its services. They also state that google processes users’ information collected when using its services only to provide those services and this is processed in accordance with Google’s privacy policy. 
Google’s privacy policy differentiates between customer data and service data: customer data relates to information that the City of Reykjavík or the users of Google’s student system transmit to Google through the system and it is covered by the processing agreement; whereas service data is data collected or generated by google during the provision and administration of its cloud services, which is processed in accordance with its privacy policy. 
Lastly, in its comments, the City of R submitted that the systems are used approximately by 8.500 students and it claimed that it has done everything it could in order to ensure compliance with the GDPR. 
After requests to provide further information and an exchange of comments, the DPA issued a report detailing the results of its assessment. After hearing explanations and viewpoints of the city of R on the DPA’s assessment, the DPA published its final decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 35, Article 44, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of personal data of primary school students by the City of R. using Google's cloud solutions and Google Workspace for education, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The City of R. acted as a controller under Article 4(7), determining the purposes and means of processing, while Google acted as a processor under Article 4(8). However, the processing agreement between them contained ambiguous clauses that in some instances reversed their roles (City as processor, Google as sub-processor), violating Article 28(3) which requires a clear mandate that the processor processes personal data only on documented instructions from the controller.

3. Google's terms specified that it processes ""service data"" (data collected or generated by Google during service provision) according to its own privacy policy rather than the controller's instructions, violating Article 28(3) which requires that processing by a processor be governed by a contract stipulating that the processor processes personal data only on documented instructions from the controller.

4. The Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) initially failed to address risks related to transfers of personal data to third countries, and was only updated in September 2022 after the investigation began, violating Article 35(7) which requires DPIAs to contain an assessment of risks and measures envisaged to address them, including safeguards for international transfers.

5. The processing involved special categories of children's data (including potentially health data, social security numbers, and behavioral data), which requires explicit consent or other specific conditions under Article 9. The City of R. relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) without conducting a proper balancing test considering children's vulnerable status, violating the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

6. Data retention practices where ""most data is retained for the whole school year"" without specific retention periods or clear deletion procedures violate the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary.

7. The transfers of personal data to Google in the United States (a third country) were not based on an adequacy decision under Article 45, and the documentation provided did not demonstrate appropriate safeguards under Article 46 or valid derogations under Article 49, violating Chapter V provisions on international transfers.

8. The City of R. failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance (accountability principle under Article 5(2)), particularly regarding data protection by design and by default under Article 25, given the large scale processing of children's data (8,500 students) and the inherent risks of cloud processing.

9. Therefore, considering the multiple violations of Articles 5, 6, 9, 25, 28, 35, and Chapter V regarding international transfers, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The Icelandic DPA initiated an ex officio investigation aimed at assessing the use of Google cloud solutions and Google Workspace for education in elementary schools of the City of Reykjavík.

The agreement also stated that the controller instructs the processor on the processing of personal data, but this is limited to certain cases. Further, it contained provisions on the security of processing, transfers of personal data and other obligations.

In addition, the controller attached Google's terms and Google's privacy policy concerning its cloud services. Google’s terms specify the information that google is provided with by the controller and information that google collects itself, either information that is added by users or device, log and location information based on the use of its services. The terms also state that google processes users’ information collected when using its services only to provide those services and this is processed in accordance with Google’s privacy policy.

After requests to provide further information and an exchange of comments, the DPA issued a report detailing the results of its assessment. After hearing explanations and viewpoints of the controller on the DPA’s assessment, the DPA published its final decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 35, Article 44, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves the City of Reykjavík as the data controller and Google as the data processor, processing personal data of approximately 8,500 elementary school students through Google cloud solutions and Google Workspace for education, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2.

2. The processing includes special categories of personal data (social security numbers) and data concerning children, which require enhanced protections under Article 9 (processing of special categories) and Article 8 (conditions applicable to child's consent), but the controller failed to identify a proper lawful basis under Article 6 or exceptions under Article 9 for processing such sensitive data.

3. The Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) required under Article 35 was inadequate as it did not properly assess all risks, particularly regarding Google's collection of service data (including device, log, and location information) beyond the customer data covered by the processing agreement, violating the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c).

4. The processing agreement under Article 28 was insufficient as it did not cover all processing activities conducted by Google, particularly the service data that Google collects independently under its privacy policy, failing to ensure that all processing is governed by the controller's instructions as required by Article 28(3) and Article 29.

5. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default under Article 25, as evidenced by Google's collection of extensive service data beyond what is necessary for educational purposes.

6. The international data transfers to Google in the United States lacked appropriate safeguards under Chapter V (Articles 44-49), as the controller did not demonstrate that the transfers were based on an adequacy decision, appropriate safeguards, or derogations for specific situations, especially considering the Schrems II ruling implications.

7. The controller did not fulfill its accountability obligation under Article 5(2), as it could not demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles despite claiming to have ""done everything it could,"" particularly regarding the lawful basis for processing, data minimization, and international transfers.

8. The processing operations did not ensure adequate transparency under Articles 13 and 14, as students and parents were not properly informed about the full extent of processing conducted by Google, including the collection of service data.

9. The retention policies described in the DPIA (""most data is retained for the whole school year"" with teachers ""encouraged to delete data"") were vague and insufficient to ensure storage limitation as required by Article 5(1)(e).

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"Following a general check carried out by the DPA on all Luxembourgish municipalities in the summer of 2022, at a meeting on 9 December 2022, the Luxembourgish DPA decided to open an investigation on the Municipal Administration of Leudelange (the controller) to assess its compliance with the GDPR.

Specifically, the controller aimed to evaluate the controller’s conformity with its obligation to appoint a DPO and whether it communicated the DPO's contact details to the DPA, as provided by Articles 37(1)(a) GDPR and Article 37(7) GDPR. 

At the end of the investigation, the appointed head of the investigation flagged to the DPA a breach of Article 37 GDPR. Thus, on 4 July 2023, the DPA held a meeting with both the head of the investigation and the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 37,"1. The case involves the Municipal Administration of Leudelange, which is a public authority as it is a municipality. According to Article 37(1)(a) GDPR, public authorities must designate a data protection officer (DPO), except for courts acting in their judicial capacity.

2. The investigation by the Luxembourgish DPA focused on compliance with Articles 37(1)(a) and 37(7) GDPR, which require the appointment of a DPO and the communication of the DPO's contact details to the supervisory authority.

3. The head of the investigation flagged a breach of Article 37 GDPR, indicating that the controller failed to designate a DPO or failed to communicate the DPO's contact details as mandated.

4. Article 37(7) GDPR explicitly states that the controller must publish the contact details of the DPO and communicate them to the supervisory authority, which the controller did not do, as evidenced by the breach.

5. Since the controller is a public authority, it is obligated under Article 37(1)(a) to appoint a DPO, and under Article 37(7) to communicate the contact details; the failure to do so constitutes a violation.

6. The verdict of NONCOMPLIANT is based on this breach, confirming that the case does not meet the requirements of the GDPR.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The Belgian DPA started an investigation into the usage of a tool called 'MeldJeAan' by the city of Antwerp.

The tool in question could be used by parents to claim a spot for their children in a school. To use the tool, specific personal data had to be provided, such as contact details, personal details of the child, and information on the parents. By logging in, schools could download the list of all the information of their students. However, due to a flaw in the system, the lists could be accessed directly without logging in. It had been noted that there had been a data breach as there was at least one confirmed download by an unauthorised party through this way.

Following the investigation, a report was produced, which  flagged several breaches by the city of Antwerp. On 23 June 2023, the DPA held a hearing on the matter.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 35, Article 38, Article 39","1. The case involves the city of Antwerp acting as a data controller processing personal data (including contact details, personal details of children, and information on parents) through the 'MeldJeAan' tool, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1).

2. The controller (city of Antwerp) failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), specifically by allowing a system flaw where school lists containing personal data could be accessed directly without authentication, resulting in unauthorized access and download of personal data.

3. The confirmed unauthorized download of personal data constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), and the controller failed to notify this breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as required by Article 33(1).

4. The controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access, as the system flaw allowed direct access to personal data without proper authentication mechanisms.

5. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as it could not show that appropriate technical measures were implemented to prevent the unauthorized access that occurred through the system flaw.

6. Therefore, based on violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 32(1), and 33(1) of the Regulation, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 14 March 2023, the DPA had notified the controller (Lääkärikeskus Gyneko Oy, a healthcare provider) of its previous decision regarding electronic healthcare appointment booking systems. At the same time, the controller had been asked to explain how its online appointment booking system works.

According to the controller, a person had to provide their name and personal identity code in order to book an appointment online. No abuse of the system had been detected and efforts had been made to detect it by monitoring the number of logins and failed login attempts. It would also have been possible to set a password for the system, but the controller had not implemented such an arrangement.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves Lääkärikeskus Gyneko Oy, a healthcare provider acting as a data controller, processing personal data through its online appointment booking system, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processing'.

2. The controller requires users to provide their name and personal identity code (a national identifier) to book appointments online. The personal identity code is considered sensitive data under Article 87, and health-related data is a special category under Article 9(1), requiring higher protection standards.

3. While Article 9(2)(h) allows processing of health data for healthcare purposes when under professional secrecy obligations, the controller must still implement appropriate security measures as required by Article 32 (security of processing) and the principle of integrity and confidentiality in Article 5(1)(f).

4. The controller acknowledged that password protection could be implemented but was not in use, relying instead on monitoring login attempts and counts. This fails to meet the requirement under Article 32(1) to implement appropriate technical measures considering the state of the art, nature of data, and risks to rights and freedoms of data subjects.

5. Article 32(1) specifically mentions pseudonymisation and encryption as appropriate measures, and the lack of even basic password authentication constitutes insufficient protection for sensitive health data, creating risks of unauthorized access and identity misuse.

6. The controller's argument that no abuse was detected does not relieve them of their obligation under Article 24 (accountability) to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to insufficient security measures for processing sensitive personal data in violation of Articles 5(1)(f), 9, 32, and 87."
"The Finnish DPA had asked the controller (Kesko Oyj, Finland's largest retail chain) to explain how it processed and stored personal data in connection with its loyalty program.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it processed basic customer information, such as the person's name and contact information, and purchasing behaviour data. Purchasing behaviour data indicates customers' detailed and product-specific purchase data. Depending on the situation, the information related to the customer was erased at the end of the customer relationship or anonymised no later than 25 months after the end of the customer relationship.

The controller also stated that it processes purchase data for business development, the provision of benefits and services, and the implementation and targeting of marketing. The controller emphasised that unjustifiably prohibiting or restricting the collection and processing of data that benefits the customer would undermine data-driven innovations and product development.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 13, Article 25, Article 58, Article 83","1. The controller processes purchasing behavior data, which includes detailed and product-specific purchase information, for purposes such as business development, provision of benefits and services, and targeted marketing. This processing involves personal data as defined in Article 4(1) of the policy.

2. Article 5(1)(c) of the policy requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization). The processing of detailed purchase data for broad purposes like business development and marketing may exceed what is necessary, as less intrusive methods could achieve the same goals.

3. Article 6(1) specifies that processing must be lawful, and for marketing activities, the controller might rely on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f). However, Article 6(1)(f) requires that the legitimate interests of the controller not override the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The controller's argument that restricting data processing would undermine innovations does not sufficiently demonstrate that this balancing test has been conducted or that data subjects' rights are protected.

4. Article 21 of the policy grants data subjects the right to object at any time to processing for direct marketing. The controller must inform data subjects of this right clearly and separately, as per Article 21(2) and (3), and cease processing for marketing upon objection. The case does not indicate that the controller provides this information or facilitates the right to object effectively.

5. Article 13 of the policy requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide specific information, including the purposes of processing and the legal basis. The controller's response to the DPA does not confirm that such information is provided to data subjects in a concise, transparent, and intelligible manner, potentially violating transparency obligations.

6. Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation) requires that personal data be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in an incompatible manner. Processing purchase data for multiple purposes like business development and marketing might not be compatible with the original collection purpose without proper justification or consent.

7. Based on the above, the processing of purchasing behavior data likely violates principles of data minimization, lawfulness, transparency, and purpose limitation under the GDPR, as outlined in Articles 5 and 6, and fails to respect data subjects' rights under Article 21.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject is a former customer (tenant) of the controller (Gavanova de immobles, S.L.).

On 29 July 2020 the data subject signed the reservation document for the property, then on 4 September 2020 the lease agreement / contract was signed. After approximately two years the lease was terminated on 31 January 2022.

On 30 June 2022 the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) received a complaint from the data subject stating, that they didn’t feel that their data was protected by the controller. The data subject suspected that their personal data had been used to enter into a contract with a third party (a cleaning company) without their knowledge. When the data subject went on the real estate´s website, the Privacy Policy page was blank. The data subject also found out that the contract and lease resolution made between the two parties, contained data protection law which was not up to date with the current law.

Following the complaint lodged by the data subject, the Spanish DPA accessed the website of the controller on 27 July 2022 and confirmed that the Privacy Policy section was in fact blank. As a result, the DPA asked the controller to explain themselves. The reason for that step was, that the controller could proceed with the analysis and inform the DPA within one month of actions carried out to adapt to the requirements set out in the data protection regulations. This was carried out in accordance with Spanish Public Administration Law (Common Administrative Procedure for Public Administrations) by electronic means. However, the controller did not take up the required steps and it was understood to have rejected them. Nevertheless, a copy was sent via post which was notified on 31 August 2022. In this notification, the controller was reminded to interact electronically and that from now on they would be notified exclusively by electronic means. The controller did not reply.

On 20 September 2022 the complaint was admitted for processing.

Shortly after, the Spanish DPA accessed the website again to check if any changes have been made. The DPA proved that the Private Policy page was last updated on 29 September 2022.

As a result, the director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the controller for the infringement of Article 13 GDPR as defined in Article 83(5)(b) GDPR. This initiation agreement was notified and delivered to the controller on 16 December 2022.

The controller responded with a written statement in due time and form on the 21 December 2022. The controller mentioned that the data subject had authorised them to process their data including the possible transfer to other companies (in this case a cleaning company). The data subject had agreed with the landlady that the cleaning of the flat would be deducted from their deposit.

Therefore, the controller argued that the complainant authorised them to process their data. Moreover, there was no significant proof of any exchange of data between the controller and the cleaning company. In addition, the controller information given to the complainant was only out of date and since then has been updated the Privacy Policy and Legal Notice have been modified. -The controller even invoked the mitigating factor that they complied with the DPA and with the procedure. They contacted a consultancy firm to advise them on compliance with the rules.  They noted that no benefits have been claimed from the commission of the offence and no rights of minors have been harmed.

On the 31 January 2023 the DPA agreed to open a period of evidence. The complaint by the data subject and the controller´s allegations to the initiation agreement and the accompanying documentation were already incorporated. The controller was required to provide a copy of the new contract they make with tenants, landlords and third-party companies.

Subsequently on 13 February 2023 the controller replied by sending the requested documents called “Lease contract” and “Termination of contract” with an annex “Information on Personal Data Protection”.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a data subject (former tenant) and a controller (Gavanova de immobles, S.L.) as defined in Article 4 of the GDPR, where the controller is responsible for processing personal data.

2. The data subject complained that the controller's website had a blank Privacy Policy page, which was confirmed by the Spanish DPA on July 27, 2022. This indicates that the controller failed to provide the required information to data subjects at the time of data collection, as mandated by Article 13 GDPR.

3. Article 13 GDPR requires controllers to provide specific information to data subjects when personal data is collected, including the identity and contact details of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, recipients of data, and other relevant details. The blank Privacy Policy constitutes a direct violation of this article, as no information was made available.

4. The controller updated the Privacy Policy on September 29, 2022, only after the DPA's intervention, but the violation persisted from at least the time of the complaint (June 30, 2022) until the update, confirming noncompliance during that period.

5. The controller argued that the data subject authorized data processing, including transfer to a cleaning company, but under Article 7 GDPR, consent must be informed, specific, and unambiguous. Without the required information provided under Article 13, any consent obtained would not be valid, as data subjects cannot make informed decisions without necessary details.

6. The DPA initiated disciplinary proceedings for infringement of Article 13, which is classified under Article 83(5)(b) GDPR as a violation of data subjects' rights, subject to administrative fines.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to the controller's failure to comply with Article 13."
"In 2019, the Finnish DPA had asked a healthcare provider (the controller) to explain how its online appointment booking system worked.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that a user had to log in to the booking system with their name and personal identity code. The system had compared the information provided by the user against the information stored in the controller's patient information system. The user had been instructed to check the login information if it did not match the information in the patient information system.

The controller acknowledged that, under certain conditions, the online appointment booking service could have been used to determine the complete personal identity of a data subject code by using brute force technique. The controller considered that this could have been prevented by limiting the retries of incorrectly entered login information.

The controller also stated that it was able to investigate possible misuse by examining the log data collected from the service. The controller was aware that the personal identity code may often be known to people other than the data subject. However, the controller had assessed the overall risks to be low or moderate in terms of likelihood and severity.

In 2020, the controller had submitted a data breach notification to the DPA, according to which the controller's online appointment booking system had been targeted by phishing. The phishing had come to light as a result of a blackmail message received by the controller, which revealed that a third party had obtained personal identity codes through the system. Following the breach, the controller had switched to strong electronic identification in its system.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves a healthcare provider (controller) processing personal data through an online appointment booking system that required users to log in with their name and personal identity code, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(1) and (2) of the GDPR.

2. The controller acknowledged that their system was vulnerable to brute force attacks that could determine a data subject's complete personal identity code, indicating a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) of the GDPR.

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The controller's failure to implement login attempt limitations left the system vulnerable to brute force attacks, violating this principle.

4. Article 32(1) specifically requires controllers to implement appropriate technical measures such as pseudonymisation and encryption, and the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems. The controller's admission that they could have prevented the vulnerability by limiting retries of incorrect login information shows they failed to implement these required measures.

5. The controller's risk assessment that considered the overall risks as ""low or moderate"" was proven incorrect when a phishing attack successfully obtained personal identity codes through the system, indicating the assessment did not properly evaluate the risks to rights and freedoms of natural persons as required by Article 32(2).

6. The subsequent data breach notification submitted in 2020 under Article 33 confirms that unauthorized access to personal data occurred, demonstrating that the controller's security measures were inadequate to prevent the breach.

7. The breach involved personal identity codes, which are sensitive personal data that require higher protection under Article 9(1), making the security failure more serious.

8. The controller's eventual implementation of strong electronic identification after the breach occurred shows that adequate security measures were feasible but not implemented proactively, violating the requirement under Article 25(1) to implement data protection by design and by default.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR requirements for data security, data protection by design and by default, and appropriate risk assessment as specified in Articles 5(1)(f), 9(1), 25(1), 32(1), and 32(2)."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a healthcare provider (the controller) charged a fee for handing over copies of magnetic resonance images (MRI) when data subjects requested access to their personal data in accordance with Article 15 GDPR.

The DPA had asked the controller to explain how it facilitated the exercise of data subject rights under Article 15 GDPR in situations where a data subject would request their MRIs without explicitly referring to their right under the GDPR.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it provided the MRIs free of charge when a patient made an access request in accordance with Article 15 GDPR. The controller also stated that it provided patients with medical records once a year free of charge when they invoked the right of access under the GDPR. However, the controller considered that when a patient requested a recording of their MRI examination directly from the MRI scanning, the right of access was not invoked, and the recording was chargeable.

The controller also stated that in its price list, it was mentioned that the provision of material related to the right of access would be free of charge if the request was made using an access request form or from the controller's registry office and that in other cases, a fee was charged for the request. It added that when the patient requested access to their personal data, the controller did not separately ask whether it was a request regarding the right of access under the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 58","1. The case involves a healthcare provider (controller) processing personal data, including MRI images, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as health data under Article 9(1), requiring special protection.

2. Article 15(1) grants data subjects the right to obtain a copy of their personal data undergoing processing, and Article 15(3) specifies that the controller shall provide the first copy free of charge, with any further copies subject to a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.

3. Article 12(2) requires the controller to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15-22, meaning the controller must not create unnecessary obstacles or formal requirements for individuals to invoke these rights.

4. The controller's policy of only providing free copies when requests use a specific form or explicitly reference GDPR Article 15 violates Article 12(2), as it places an undue burden on data subjects to use specific terminology or channels to exercise their rights.

5. The controller's distinction between a ""GDPR access request"" and a direct request for MRI recordings is artificial and unsupported by the Regulation, as any request by a data subject for their personal data must be treated as an exercise of their right of access under Article 15, regardless of how it is phrased.

6. By charging fees for requests that do not use specific terminology or forms, the controller fails to fulfill its obligation under Article 15(3) to provide the first copy free of charge, effectively restricting data subjects' rights through procedural requirements.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically violating Articles 12(2) and 15(3)."
"The CNIL commenced an investigation into the data controller to verify compliance with the GDPR, including an online check of the website www.new.neosurf.com and an on-the-spot check of the data controller’s premises. The data controller was an electronic money distributor that facilitates online payments. The rapporteur undertaking these investigations found that when creating a user account on the www.neosurf.com website, the surname, first name, date of birth, postal address, email address, telephone number and, if applicable, bank details were collected, as well as personal documents, such as proof of identity and residence. While the data controller specified a retention period of ten years of this data from the last transaction carried out on the account, in fact, no purge had been carried out in the databases since the beginning of its activity in 2005. An estimated 70,049 accounts had been inactive for more than ten years, but not deleted or anonymised. Additionally, 51,735 accounts were kept for no purpose, insofar as they were ""unconfirmed"", i.e. the email address had not been confirmed when the account was created.

Furthermore, the information provided by the company on the website www.neosurf.com and on its mobile application via the privacy policy was incomplete, not up-to-date and only in English.

The data controller also allowed users to create account passwords comprised of six-characters or more, composed of three categories of characters (uppercase, lowercase and numbers) and that no access restrictions in the event of authentication failure were implemented. 49,214 passwords were entered in clear text in the company's database and associated with their email address and identifier.

Additionally, thirteen cookies were deposited before any action, including consent, could be taken by the user upon arrival on the home page of the website www.neosurf.com. The Google reCaptcha module, to block robots on the registration and connection page to the neosurf website and mobile application, was also used without asking for user consent.

The data controller argued that the proposed administrative fine was disproportionate to the alleged breaches and its conduct since it had implemented several corrective measures, in particular, the effective application of its policy on the retention of user account data, the implementation of a password policy with an adequate level of security, the use of a state-of-the-art password hashing algorithm and the collection of consent to the deposit of cookies and tracers when required.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32","1. The case involves a data controller (Neosurf) processing personal data of users, which falls under the territorial scope of the GDPR as per Article 3, since the controller is established in the Union and processes personal data in the context of its activities.

2. The controller violated the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, as personal data was retained beyond the necessary period for the purposes specified. Specifically, 70,049 accounts were inactive for more than ten years but not deleted or anonymized, and 51,735 unconfirmed accounts were kept without any purpose, contrary to the requirement that data be kept only as long as necessary.

3. The controller also failed to comply with the right to erasure under Article 17(1)(a) and (b), as personal data that was no longer necessary for the purposes (inactive accounts) or where the processing basis was invalid (unconfirmed accounts) should have been erased without undue delay, but no purge had been conducted since 2005.

4. Regarding transparency and information obligations, the controller did not provide complete, up-to-date, and accessible information to data subjects as required by Articles 13 and 14. The privacy policy on the website and mobile application was incomplete, not updated, and only available in English, which may not constitute ""clear and plain language"" or be ""easily accessible"" for all users, especially in France, violating Article 12(1).

5. The controller failed to implement appropriate security measures under Article 32(1) of the GDPR. Passwords were stored in clear text (49,214 instances), which lacks pseudonymization and encryption, and the password policy allowed six-character passwords with minimal complexity without access restrictions on authentication failure, insufficient to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

6. The controller deposited cookies and used Google reCaptcha without obtaining valid consent from users, processing personal data without a lawful basis under Article 6(1). Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous as per Article 4(11) and Article 7, but users were not given the opportunity to consent before cookies were placed, violating these provisions.

7. The controller's argument about implementing corrective measures does not negate the violations that occurred during the investigation period, as the GDPR requires ongoing compliance and accountability under Article 5(2), and past non-compliance remains relevant.

8. Therefore, based on the violations of multiple GDPR articles, including Articles 5(1)(e), 17, 13, 14, 12, 32, 6, and 7, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Finnish DPA had asked the controller (OP-Henkivakuutus Oy, a life insurance company) to explain on which legal basis and for what purpose it processed data subjects' health data requested from the health care. The controller was also asked to explain how it processed personal data before the execution of an insurance contract.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the processing was based on Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, according to which insurance institutions may, despite the general prohibition in Article 9(1) GDPR, process the health data of the insured party and the claimant, which is necessary to determine the liability of the insurance institution. The controller considered that it had the right to process health data at all stages of the life insurance customer relationship: when applying for insurance, during the insurance period and after an insured event has occurred.

The controller also stated that it requested all data subjects applying for life insurance for their consent to that the controller may, if necessary, request health data from health care units in order to process the insurance application and possible compensation case, and to ensure the accuracy of the health data. The controller considered it necessary that the consent given by data subjects was valid for the entire duration of the insurance contract.

The controller claimed that a situation where the data subject withdraws their consent or does not give it in the first place, but the controller must still issue life insurance and keep it valid, is impossible. In the controller's view, the data subject could have terminated the insurance at any time if they did not want the controller to receive their health data from the health care.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 58","1. The case involves OP-Henkivakuutus Oy, a life insurance company (controller) processing health data, which is a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR, requiring heightened protections.

2. The controller claims processing is based on Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, which permits processing health data for determining insurance liability. However, under GDPR Article 9(2), such national law must be proportionate and provide suitable safeguards. The controller's broad interpretation—processing health data at all stages of the insurance relationship—may exceed what is ""necessary"" for determining liability, potentially violating the principle of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)).

3. The controller requires data subjects to consent to the processing of health data from healthcare units as a condition for obtaining and maintaining life insurance. Under GDPR Article 7(4), consent is not freely given if it is bundled as a non-negotiable condition for a service, especially where there is an imbalance of power between the controller and data subject. This undermines the validity of consent.

4. The controller argues that withdrawal of consent would necessitate termination of the insurance contract. However, GDPR Article 7(3) explicitly states that withdrawal of consent must be as easy as giving it and shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Threatening contract termination for withdrawal coerces data subjects into maintaining consent, violating the requirement for freely given consent.

5. The controller's practice of obtaining consent for the entire duration of the insurance contract conflicts with GDPR Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization) and Article 11 (processing that no longer requires identification), as continuous processing of health data without specific purposes may be excessive. Consent must be specific and informed for each purpose (Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a)).

6. The controller’s reliance on consent for processing health data is problematic because consent under Article 9(2)(a) must be explicit and freely given. Given the conditional nature of the insurance contract, consent cannot be considered freely given, making the processing unlawful under Article 9.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to invalid consent, potential overreach of national law, and failure to adhere to principles of lawfulness, purpose limitation, and data minimization."
"Following a series of reports and complaints against ICS, a subsidiary of ABN AMRO, as a controller, the Dutch DPA (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, AP) decided to start an ex officio investigation into the processing operations carried out by the controller. The AP mainly received complaints concerning the controller's process of re-identifying its customers online by means of a new identification and verification tool, ID&V. The AP found that the controller never conducted a DPIA in 2018, prior to the introduction of its identification system, and asked the controller to provide its submissions on this.

The controller claimed in this respect that it did not need to carry out a DPIA, since the same identification system was used by ABN AMRO before, and ABN AMRO had previously carried out a risk assessment of its own authentication app. Moreover, the controller argued that when ID&V was introduced, there were no risks of potential misuse of personal data, and strict security measures were in place. Also, the controller argued that the only criterion that suggested the need to carry out a DPIA, according to Article 35 GDPR, was the fact that the processing was large-scale, but no other criteria were given that would make its processing activities ""high risk"". Lastly, the controller claimed that it does not process any special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 35,"1. The case involves ICS, a subsidiary of ABN AMRO, acting as a data controller processing personal data through its identification and verification tool (ID&V), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2.

2. The controller argued that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was not necessary because ABN AMRO had previously conducted a risk assessment for a similar authentication app. However, Article 35(1) requires that a DPIA be conducted specifically for processing operations that are ""likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,"" and it must be carried out ""prior to the processing."" The use of a previous assessment by a different entity (even a parent company) does not fulfill this requirement, as each controller must assess their own processing activities.

3. The controller claimed that no risks of potential misuse existed and that strict security measures were in place. However, Article 35(1) mandates a proactive assessment of risk likelihood, and the existence of security measures does not automatically negate the obligation to conduct a DPIA when the processing type inherently presents high risks.

4. The controller argued that only the ""large-scale"" criterion from Article 35(3) applied, but no other high-risk factors were present. However, Article 35(3) specifies that a DPIA is required in particular for: (a) systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects based on automated processing, including profiling; (b) large-scale processing of special categories of data or criminal data; or (c) systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. The ID&V tool involves systematic and extensive evaluation for identification purposes, which aligns with Article 35(3)(a). Additionally, the Dutch DPA (AP) maintains a list of processing operations requiring a DPIA under Article 35(4), and the AP's investigation indicates that this processing was considered high-risk.

5. The controller stated that it does not process special categories of data under Article 9. While this may be true, Article 35(3) does not require all criteria to be met; only one of the listed conditions is sufficient to trigger the DPIA obligation. The systematic and extensive automated processing for identification purposes is sufficient under Article 35(3)(a).

6. The controller failed to conduct a DPIA as required under Article 35(1) and (3), which constitutes a violation of the GDPR. This is further supported by the fact that the AP received multiple complaints about the processing, indicating actual risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy, specifically with Article 35 of the GDPR."
"On 2 June 2021, the French DPA (“CNIL”) informed a French municipality (“the controller”)  that they had not named a DPO. The municipality did not respond, therefore on 25 April 2022, the CNIL gave formal notice to the municipality to designate a DPO within four months of this notice. The controller neither replied to the DPA, nor complied with its requests.

The French DPA started a sanctioning procedure against the controller on 8 February 2023.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 31, Article 37","1. The case involves a French municipality acting as a data controller under GDPR, as it processes personal data in the context of its public authority activities (Article 4(7)).

2. Under Article 37(1)(a), public authorities or bodies must designate a data protection officer (DPO), making this a mandatory requirement for the municipality.

3. The French DPA (CNIL) informed the controller of this obligation on 2 June 2021, and issued a formal notice on 25 April 2022 with a four-month compliance deadline, exercising its powers under Article 58(1) to order compliance.

4. The controller failed to respond to both communications and did not designate a DPO, violating Article 37(1)(a) regarding mandatory DPO designation.

5. The controller's failure to cooperate with the CNIL also violates Article 31, which requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request.

6. The CNIL initiated a sanctioning procedure on 8 February 2023 pursuant to Article 58(2)(i), which allows imposing administrative fines for non-compliance.

7. The controller's persistent non-compliance despite formal notice demonstrates a negligent character of infringement, an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(b) when determining fines.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Finnish DPA had asked the controller (LähiTapiola Keskinäinen Henkivakuutusyhtiö, a life insurance company) to explain on which legal basis and for what purpose it processed data subjects' health data requested from the health care. The controller was also asked to explain how it processed personal data before the execution of an insurance contract, and how it ensured that it did not process unnecessary personal data.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it processed data subjects' health data for the performance of an insurance contract in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. In addition, the processing was based on Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, according to which insurance institutions may, despite the general prohibition in Article 9(1) GDPR, process the health data of the insured party and the claimant, which is necessary to determine the liability of the insurance institution.

The controller stated that it requested all data subjects applying for life insurance for their consent to that the controller may, if necessary, request health data from health care units in order to determine the scope of the insurance coverage and the amount of the insurance premium, as well as whether the insurance can be granted.

The controller also stated that it only requested health data necessary for the execution of the insurance contract. The necessity of the health data depends on the insurance product and is generally requested for the five years preceding the insurance application. The controller emphasised that the health data received from data subjects or health care units is almost always relevant in terms of the insurance contract.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 25, Article 58","1. The case involves the processing of health data, which is classified as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, prohibiting its processing unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies.

2. The controller claims processing is based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract) and Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act (implementing Article 9(2)(g) GDPR for substantial public interest). However, Article 9(2)(g) requires that processing be necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on Union or Member State law which must be proportionate, respect the essence of data protection rights, and provide suitable safeguards. The controller's broad claim of necessity without demonstrating specific safeguards or proportionality measures violates these requirements.

3. The controller additionally relies on data subject consent for accessing health data from healthcare units. Under Article 9(2)(a), processing special category data based on consent requires explicit consent. However, Recital 43 and Article 7(4) state that consent is not freely given if there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and controller (e.g., in insurance contracts). Thus, consent obtained as a condition for insurance coverage is invalid under GDPR standards.

4. The principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary. The controller's practice of requesting ""all health data"" for a five-year period and claiming it is ""almost always relevant"" demonstrates a systematic collection exceeding necessity, violating this principle.

5. Article 9(3) imposes additional conditions for processing health data, requiring that it be carried out under the responsibility of a professional subject to secrecy obligations. The controller did not demonstrate that such safeguards were implemented when accessing health data from healthcare units.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to invalid legal bases for processing special category data, insufficient safeguards, invalid consent due to power imbalance, and violation of data minimization principles."
"In November 2019, the French DPA (""CNIL"") carried out inspections on the premises of Amazon France Logistique (“controller”) to apprehend the processing of employee's personal data via scanners and video surveillance.

The CNIL discovered that when an employee was assigned to a direct task, they were equipped with a scanner, enabling them to identify themselves, receive instructions, scan labels of the items they were processing etc. This allowed the controller to continuously collect data relating to the activity of employees assigned to direct tasks making it possible to measure the employee’s activity, in particular by counting the number of units they process over a given period.

Inactivity indicators were reported in real time for each employee. One of the indicators named Stow Gun Machine allowed the controller to monitor each gesture performed by the employee in each direct task assigned to them, by associating with it an error indicator each time their speed was less than 1,25 seconds. These indicators were stored for 31 days and could be consulted both via raw data and in the form of statistics. Weekly performance reports were drawn up for each employee on the basis of the indicators collected, and contained weekly, daily and hourly statistics on compliance with quality procedures and productivity.

Following the on-site inspections, numerous exchanges took place between the CNIL and the controller, from November 2019 to January 2021. The CNIL started a sanctioning procedure against the controller on 28 January 2021.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32","1. The case involves processing of employee personal data by Amazon France Logistique (""controller"") through scanner systems and video surveillance that continuously collect data on employee activity, including measuring productivity, monitoring gestures with error indicators for speed less than 1.25 seconds, and generating weekly performance reports (Case facts).

2. The processing violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) as the collection of data on each gesture performed by employees with precise timing measurements exceeds what is necessary for the purposes of workforce management and performance evaluation.

3. The processing violates the principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) as the continuous monitoring and storage of granular activity data for 31 days exceeds what is necessary for the stated purposes.

4. The processing lacks a valid lawful basis under Article 6, as:
   - Consent cannot be considered freely given due to the imbalance of power in the employment relationship (Recital 43)
   - The processing exceeds what is necessary for legitimate interests pursued by the controller, as the intrusive monitoring disproportionately infringes on employees' rights and freedoms

5. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects about the processing activities as required by Articles 13 and 14, particularly regarding the extent of monitoring, performance metrics, and consequences of the processing.

6. The processing involves systematic monitoring of employees on a large scale through automated means, which requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(3)(b), which the controller failed to conduct.

7. The processing violates Article 88 regarding processing in the employment context, as French law requires that employee monitoring be proportionate and necessary, and that employees be informed of such monitoring, which was not adequately implemented.

8. The continuous monitoring of employee activity through performance metrics and error indicators without appropriate safeguards violates the fundamental right to data protection and the principles of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including excessive data collection, lack of valid lawful basis, insufficient transparency, failure to conduct required impact assessment, and disproportionate monitoring of employees."
"AULA is Denmark's school communication platform. AULA therefore, processes personal data, including confidential and sensitive personal data, about vulnerable data subjects, including children. The users of the system are often persons who do not work primarily with data protection (including teachers, staff as well as pupils and parents) and so high security measures under Article 32 GDPR and Article 25 GDPR are required.

The Danish DPA observed a number of personal data breaches in connection with the processing of personal data in AULA within Danish municipalities. A large proportion of the notifications of personal data breaches in AULA concern personal data being sent to one or more incorrect recipients in AULA. For example, where a message or secure file about a child has been sent to another child's parents, or where a message has been sent by mistake to a group of recipients instead of a specific recipient.

The DPA therefore, decided to conducted inspections into the processing of data in the AULA IT system across six municipalities. The investigations focused on the security of technical and organisational measures.

The DPA decided to inspect these municipalities collectively. Since all muncipalites used the same IT systems the same general data protection law issues would arise. The investigation included Esbjerg Municipality, Frederikshavn Municipality, Hillerød Municipality, Copenhagen Municipality, Lolland Municipality and Randers Municipality, which were selected with the aim of gaining a broad and representative insight into the municipalities' considerations in relation to the security of processing when using AULA.

The Danish DPA decided in five of the six cases. The investigation case with the City of Copenhagen contained some additional elements, which is why the Danish DPA has not yet made a decision in this case. Overall. the inspections revealed concerns about personal data breaches, especially regarding the inadvertent transmission of sensitive information to unintended recipients within AULA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 25","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, including sensitive data (e.g., information about children) through the AULA platform by multiple Danish municipalities, which qualify as data controllers under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The Danish DPA observed numerous personal data breaches where sensitive data was sent to incorrect recipients within AULA (e.g., messages about a child sent to another child's parents). This violates Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR, which requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing.

3. The breaches involve special categories of personal data (e.g., data concerning children and potentially health or other sensitive information), which under Article 9 require higher protection. The failures in securing this data contravene Article 9(1), which prohibits processing such data unless specific conditions (e.g., Article 9(2)(g) for substantial public interest) are met with appropriate safeguards.

4. The recurring nature of the breaches indicates a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) of the GDPR. This includes measures to prevent accidental disclosure of data to unauthorized recipients.

5. The municipalities, as controllers, are responsible under Article 24 for implementing effective measures to comply with the GDPR. The widespread issues across multiple municipalities using the same system suggest a systemic failure in adhering to data protection by design and by default principles under Article 25.

6. The DPA's collective inspection revealed that the municipalities did not sufficiently address the risks associated with processing sensitive data of vulnerable data subjects (e.g., children), failing to meet the heightened security obligations under Articles 25 and 32.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"Between March 2022 and October 2022, the French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out on-site inspections of TAGADAMEDIA (“controller”), as well as online inspections of their website. The CNIL discovered that the controller collected data (first name, surname, date of birth, postal address, e-mail address, phone number) from prospects through forms when offering them to participate in competitions or product testing on its website.

The controller used two forms to do so: before 2017, the controller used a single-button form – below the fields allowing data subjects to enter their details, there was a single “I VALIDATE” button with a green background and an arrow. Above the button, a text in a much smaller font stated that by clicking on the button, the user accepted that the data collected would be used to send offers from the controller’s partners and hyperlinks provided access to the data protection policy. The end of the text indicated that if the data subject wished to continue without receiving offers from the company’s partners, they could click on a link in the text (“I click here”), allowing the data subject to accept, or refuse that their personal data be sent to the controller’s partners.

The second form implemented from 2017 until the notification of the sanction report in 2023 was a two-button form with an “I VALIDATE” button written in white on a red background and an “I REFUSE” button written in black on a grey background, in a font smaller than the first button. Above these buttons, a text written in a font much smaller than that used for the buttons specified that by clicking on the ""I VALIDATE"" button, the user accepted that the data collected would be used to send offers from the company's partners.

The CNIL initiated a sanctioning procedure against the controller on 22 June 2023. During this procedure, the controller proposed a new form composed of an “I ACCEPT” button and a “NEXT STEP” button, both written in white on a red background and having a text in a much smaller font specifying that by clicking on the “I ACCEPT” button, the data subject accepted that the data would be used to send them offers from the controller’s partners, whereas the “NEXT STEP” button allowed them to continue without receiving offers from partners.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 30","1. The controller, TAGADAMEDIA, processes personal data (e.g., first name, surname, date of birth, etc.) from prospects for the purpose of sending offers from partners, which requires consent under Article 6(1)-(a) of the GDPR policy, as processing must be based on one of the lawful grounds, and consent is specified for such purposes.

2. Consent must be a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes, as defined in Article 4, and must be provided through a clear affirmative action, per Article 7.

3. The forms used by the controller before 2017 and from 2017 to 2023 did not present the request for consent in a manner that is clearly distinguishable from other matters, as the text explaining consent for partner offers was in a much smaller font than the buttons, and the button design did not provide equal prominence for accepting and refusing consent, violating Article 7(1), which requires that consent be presented in a clearly distinguishable form, and Article 12(1), which requires information to be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.

4. Specifically, the single-button form (before 2017) had a single ""I VALIDATE"" button with consent information in small print, which bundled consent with other actions and did not allow for a separate clear affirmative action for consent to partner offers, failing to meet the requirement for unambiguous consent under Article 4.

5. The two-button form (2017 to 2023) had an emphasized ""I VALIDATE"" button (red background, white text) and a de-emphasized ""I REFUSE"" button (grey background, black text, smaller font), which made it harder for data subjects to refuse consent, thereby undermining the freedom of consent required by Article 7, as consent must be freely given and not obtained through imbalance in design.

6. The proposed new form with ""I ACCEPT"" and ""NEXT STEP"" buttons both in red with white text, and explanatory text in a much smaller font, still does not clearly distinguish between accepting and refusing consent, as ""NEXT STEP"" is ambiguous and does not explicitly indicate refusal, potentially leading to confusion and lack of unambiguous consent, violating Article 4 and Article 7.

7. Due to the inadequate design of the forms, the controller failed to obtain valid consent for processing personal data for marketing purposes, rendering the processing unlawful under Article 6(1)-(a).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Italian DPA, received the news about a new AI-driven surveillance system implemented by the municipality of Trento, the controller, with the support of FBK, a research foundation. In the context of this social experiment, the controller allowed the deployment of three projects, “Marvel” and “Protector”, concluded by now, and “Precrisis” still to be activated, using AI systems that were developed by the foundation in order to collect data from public areas in the municipality by means of videocameras and microphones that could serve the aim of preventing potential situations of danger to the public.

Upon learning about these facts, the DPA initiated an investigation into the processing operations related to the above mentioned projects by the controller and asked it to provide further information.

Among other things, the controller specified that the projects were EU-funded and provided details about the technical functioning of each of them. In particular, “Marvel” is aimed at developing an automated system analysing real-time audiovisual scenes in order to detect urban security issues. The foundation has access to the recordings of the public cameras in the municipality, which are instantly anonymized and analysed in the workstations of the foundation. The “Protector” project instead is aimed at improving security around places of worship, especially against the risk of hate crimes and terror attacks. The platform acquires video data from cameras present in the areas around places of worship and textual data derived from social media hate comments which are then elaborated by an AI system in order to detect possible relevant risks. Here too, the foundation has real-time access to the recordings which are instantly anonymized. Lastly, as regards the “Precrisis” project, the controller submitted that this has not been implemented yet but will be activated soon, upon adopting the necessary measures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.

Further, the controller submitted, with regard to all three projects, that the legal basis for such processing is Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and the controller referred to an Italian law that grants competence to municipalities to adopt video-surveillance systems to improve urban security. Further, the controller claimed that since the projects are still in their development stage, the provisions of the GDPR would only start applying when these are activated. Moreover, the controller added that such research projects would also be carried out in line with the provision in Article 89 GDPR. Last, the controller submitted that it nominated the foundation as a processor under Article 28 GDPR for the future processing of personal data that will take place once the projects are activated.

The DPA responded to these and further submissions by the controller stating that it would start proceedings aimed at the adoption of corrective measures against the controller for unlawful processing activities.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 10, Article 13, Article 14, Article 35, Article 83","1. The case involves the municipality of Trento as a controller processing personal data through AI-driven surveillance systems in public areas, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller processes personal data including video and audio recordings, which may involve special categories of data under Article 9(1) (e.g., biometric data for identification). Processing such data is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller relies on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest) but fails to identify a specific condition under Article 9(2) for processing special categories of data, thus violating Article 9.

3. The controller claims that the GDPR does not apply during the development stage of the projects. However, Article 4(2) defines processing as any operation performed on personal data, including collection and analysis. Since the projects involve real-time access to recordings and analysis, processing is occurring presently, not merely in the future, making the GDPR applicable now. This constitutes a violation of the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

4. The controller nominates FBK as a processor under Article 28 but does not provide evidence of a contract or other legal act ensuring that the processor provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, as required by Article 28(3). This violates the obligations for using processors.

5. The controller relies on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest) for legality but does not demonstrate that the processing is necessary and proportionate for this purpose, as required by Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation) and Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation). The broad surveillance and analysis of public areas may exceed what is necessary for urban security, especially without specific safeguards.

6. The controller invokes Article 89 (safeguards for research) but the primary purpose appears to be security monitoring, not research. Even if research is involved, Article 89 requires appropriate safeguards like data minimisation and pseudonymisation, which are not adequately detailed by the controller. This suggests non-compliance with Article 89.

7. For the ""Precrisis"" project, the controller admits it is not yet implemented but plans activation without having complied with GDPR requirements upfront, such as conducting a data protection impact assessment (Article 35) for high-risk processing, which is likely given the use of AI surveillance. This violates the principle of accountability and prior consultation under Article 36.

8. The processing involves real-time access to recordings by FBK, which may involve transfers or access that are not adequately secured or documented, potentially violating Articles 32 (security of processing) and 30 (records of processing activities).

9. The controller does not address the rights of data subjects under Articles 12–22, such as the right to be informed (Articles 13 and 14) or the right to object (Article 21), particularly since processing is based on public interest. This omission violates transparency and data subject rights provisions.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations across Articles 5, 6, 9, 28, 35, and 89, among others."
"Following four previous decisions by the Danish DPA into the usage of Google Chromebooks and Workspace for Education by the municipality of Helsingor, the DPA began its investigation into 53 Danish municipalities, between 8 September and 24 October 2022,  regarding their use of Google Chromebooks and Workspace for Education.

The DPA requested the municipalities for further clarifications and also asked them to carry out a data protection impact assessment. On 12 September 2022, the DPA was informed by the KL (Local Government Denmark) to be representing the municipalities and that it would submit a joint response on behalf of all affected municipalities. On 30 June 2023, the KL provided the DPA with a complete response containing documentation by all municipalities.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 58","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by 53 Danish municipalities (public authorities acting as data controllers) through their use of Google Chromebooks and Workspace for Education (where Google acts as a processor), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2.

2. The municipalities, as controllers, are subject to the general principles for processing personal data under Article 5, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, and accountability, and must ensure appropriate safeguards when using processors as required by Article 28.

3. The investigation revealed that the municipalities' use of Google's services involved transferring personal data to the United States, a third country without an adequacy decision under Article 45, requiring appropriate safeguards under Article 46.

4. The European Data Protection Board's recommendations following the Schrems II ruling (which invalidated the Privacy Shield) require that transfers to third countries like the US must have supplementary measures to ensure data protection equivalent to the GDPR, which were not sufficiently implemented here.

5. The Danish DPA found that the municipalities' data processing operations, particularly the transfers to the US, did not provide adequate safeguards for the data subjects' rights, as the measures in place were insufficient to counter the risks of access by US intelligence agencies under laws like FISA 702.

6. The joint response from KL on behalf of the municipalities, while submitted, did not demonstrate compliance with the requirements for international data transfers under Chapter V of the GDPR, specifically Articles 44-49, as the supplementary measures implemented were deemed inadequate.

7. Therefore, the processing operations, including the data transfers to Google in the US, were found to be in violation of the GDPR's provisions on international transfers and the general principles of data protection, leading to the verdict of noncompliance by the Danish DPA.

8. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 23 March 2023, an employee of the controller consulted an extract of the data subject's personal data stored in the Belgian National Register, which refers to the information processing system that records, memorizes and communicates information relating to the identification of Belgian citizens.

After that, the data subjectfiled an access request with the controller, requesting clarification into who accessed their data and for what purpose.  Due to not receiving any response regarding the access request, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA on 14 June 2023.

On 7 August 2023, the controller replied to the access request, acknowledging that it consulted the National Register records of the data subject and that the processing was performed by a professional with specific authorization. However, due to professional secrecy, the controller could not disclose the professional's identity or assess whether the consultation complied with legal and ethical obligations.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 15, Article 24","1. The case involves a data subject whose personal data was processed by a controller (an entity consulting the Belgian National Register), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, since it involves processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The data subject exercised their right of access under Article 15, requesting information about who accessed their data and for what purpose. Under Article 15(1), the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller information about ""the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed.""

3. The controller failed to respond to the access request within the one-month timeframe specified in Article 12(3), which requires controllers to provide information on action taken ""without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.""

4. When the controller eventually responded, they acknowledged accessing the data but refused to disclose the identity of the professional who consulted it, citing professional secrecy. However, Article 15(1) explicitly grants the data subject the right to know ""the recipients or categories of recipients,"" and this right is not automatically overridden by professional secrecy obligations.

5. While Article 23 allows for restrictions of data subject rights under certain conditions, including for the protection of judicial independence and proceedings, any such restriction must ""respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms"" and be ""a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society."" The controller's blanket refusal without demonstrating that such restriction met these requirements violates Article 23.

6. Furthermore, under Article 12(1), the controller must provide information ""in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language."" The controller's response failed to meet this standard by not providing meaningful information about the access.

7. The controller also failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2), as they did not provide adequate justification for why professional secrecy should override the data subject's access rights or how they ensured compliance with the GDPR's principles.

8. The case involves processing of personal data from the National Register, which may include special categories of data under Article 9, but the controller's failure to properly handle the access request constitutes a separate violation irrespective of the data type.

9. Therefore, based on violations of Article 12 (transparent communication and timely response), Article 15 (right of access), and Article 5 (accountability principle), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The DPA initiated an investigation into the local municipality of the 1st district in Bucharest (the controller) after receiving several referrals alleging a possible infringement of the GDPR.

The notices regarded the financial incentives of the programme ""Local measures to ensure energy needs and energy efficiency in households in Sector 1"". By decisions of the Local Council, it was established how the inhabitants of Sector 1 could submit the necessary documents to benefit from the financial incentives of the programme: in physical format or via e-mail. However, the controller had made available also an online platform for data collection that had been purchased before the decision was approved by the Local Council.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 58,"1. The case involves the local municipality of the 1st district in Bucharest as a data controller processing personal data through an online platform for its energy efficiency program, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1).

2. The controller failed to establish a proper lawful basis for processing personal data as required by Article 6(1). While the program was established by Local Council decisions, the online platform was implemented without proper authorization or consideration of lawful processing conditions.

3. The controller violated the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) by implementing an online data collection platform that likely processed more personal data than necessary for the specified purposes, as the Council decisions only authorized physical or email submissions.

4. The controller likely failed to provide adequate information to data subjects as required by Articles 13 and 14, particularly regarding the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, and data subject rights, especially for data collected through the unauthorized online platform.

5. The processing operations, being carried out by a public authority and involving systematic processing of citizen data, should have undergone a data protection impact assessment under Article 35(1) and (3)(a), which the controller apparently failed to conduct prior to implementing the online platform.

6. The controller violated the accountability principle under Article 5(2) by failing to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles through appropriate technical and organizational measures, including proper authorization procedures for data processing systems.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."
"The Italian DPA conducted an investigation into the compliance of the Municipality of Syracuse with Article 37(7) GDPR. During the investigation, it was discovered that the Municipality had failed to fulfil its obligation to designate a DPO and communicate their contact details to the DPA, as required by Article 37 GDPR.

Also the “Guidelines on Data Protection Officers”, adopted by the Article 29 Working Party outline the requirements for designating a DPO and communicating their contact details to the DPA. The Italian DPA even established in the ""Documento di indirizzo su designazione, posizione e compiti del Responsabile della protezione dei dati (RPD) in ambito pubblico"" a dedicated online procedure for entities to use in communicating the DPO's contact details. This procedure served as the sole authorised channel for such communications and was designed to ensure the efficient and secure transfer of information between entities and the DPA.

Although the Municipality had published the contact details of the DPOs on its website, it had not officially communicated this information to the DPA, thus violating Article 37(7) GDPR. The Municipality's attempts to rectify the situation, such as contacting the DPA by phone and submitting the contact details of the DPOs through an online form, were deemed insufficient by the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 37,"1. The case involves the Municipality of Syracuse, a public authority acting as a data controller, which is subject to the obligations of the GDPR as per Article 2 (Material scope) and specifically required to designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO) under Article 37(1)(a), as processing is carried out by a public authority.

2. Article 37(7) GDPR explicitly states: ""The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority."" This creates a dual obligation: to publish the details (e.g., on a website) and to communicate them directly to the relevant Data Protection Authority (DPA).

3. The ""Guidelines on Data Protection Officers"" adopted by the Article 29 Working Party (WP243), which provide authoritative interpretation of the GDPR, reinforce that the obligation to communicate the DPO's details to the supervisory authority is a distinct and mandatory requirement separate from publication.

4. The Italian DPA further specified this obligation by establishing a dedicated, sole authorised online procedure for entities to use when communicating the DPO's contact details, as outlined in its ""Documento di indirizzo su designazione, posizione e compiti del Responsabile della protezione dei dati (RPD) in ambito pubblico."" This procedure is a lawful and specific measure to ensure the efficient and secure fulfilment of the Article 37(7) communication requirement.

5. The Municipality of Syracuse fulfilled the first part of its obligation under Article 37(7) by publishing the DPO's contact details on its website.

6. However, the Municipality failed to fulfil the second, distinct part of its obligation by not officially communicating the DPO's contact details to the Italian DPA through the mandated online procedure. Attempts to rectify the situation via a phone call and a different online form were insufficient, as they did not constitute use of the sole authorised channel established by the DPA.

7. The failure to use the prescribed procedure meant the DPA did not receive the communication in the required manner, resulting in a violation of the controller's obligation under Article 37(7) to communicate the DPO's details to the supervisory authority.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"Société Particulier à Particulier - Editions Neressis (""controller"") provides individuals with a set of publications and services allowing them to conclude real estate transactions without intermediaries. The CNIL conducted an online investigation of their website, www.pap.fr, to verify the methods of informing people about their rights as data subjects, and whether the procedure for creating a user account was sufficiently secure and confidential.

The on-site investigation focused on the verification of the retention periods applied to user account data, the legality of data processor agreements in place and the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the data collected through the website.

During its investigations, the CNIL found that the controller defined a systematic retention period of ten years from the acceptance of an order on the website. The CNIL also discovered that the controller did not include the right to lodge a complaint with the DPA, the legal basis for each processing as well as the recipients and categories of recipients in their privacy policy.

The CNIL initiated a sanctioning procedure against the controller on 6 February 2023.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller (Société Particulier à Particulier - Editions Neressis) processing personal data through its website www.pap.fr, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as it involves processing of personal data by automated means (Article 2(1)).

2. The controller applied a systematic retention period of ten years for user account data from acceptance of an order, without justification based on the purposes of processing. This violates the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes for which they are processed.

3. The controller's privacy policy failed to include information about the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, which is a mandatory element under Article 13(2)(d) when personal data are collected from the data subject.

4. The privacy policy also omitted the legal basis for each processing operation, which is required information under Article 13(1)(c) when collecting personal data from data subjects.

5. Additionally, the policy did not include information about recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, violating the requirement under Article 13(1)(e).

6. These omissions constitute failures to provide transparent information to data subjects as required under Article 12(1) and specific information obligations under Article 13, impairing data subjects' ability to understand how their personal data is processed and exercise their rights effectively.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Italian DPA was informed that a general practitioner (the controller) was processing the personal data of his patients in breach of the principles of integrity and confidentiality.

On the exterior wall of the controller’s office, there was a mailbox and a metal box without any names, and on the box, there was the indication ""only medical prescriptions"" with a key inserted in the lock. This box was freely accessible to the public and was located on a public square. Inside the box, there were numerous medical prescriptions, not placed inside closed envelopes, issued to different subjects.

This practice was corroborated by other seven patients of the controller, who confirmed that this system had begun during the COVID-19 pandemic and was kept afterwards.

Considering that the described conduct was not found to conform to the relevant data protection rules, the DPA notified the controller of the opening of the procedure pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 32","1. The case involves a general practitioner (the controller) processing personal data of patients, specifically medical prescriptions containing health-related information, which qualifies as special category data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller stored medical prescriptions in a metal box on a public square with a key inserted in the lock, making it freely accessible to the public. The prescriptions were not placed in closed envelopes, exposing patient data to unauthorized access.

3. Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The controller's practice of leaving sensitive health data in an publicly accessible box without adequate safeguards violates this principle of integrity and confidentiality.

4. Article 32 of the GDPR mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Given the sensitive nature of health data, the controller failed to apply measures such as encryption, access controls, or secure storage, which are necessary to protect against unauthorized disclosure.

5. Article 9(1) prohibits processing of special category data (including health data) unless specific conditions under Article 9(2) are met. The controller's practice does not align with any of the exceptions, such as explicit consent or necessity for health purposes, and lacks the required safeguards under Article 9(2)(h) or (i).

6. The controller's system, initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued afterward, was confirmed by multiple patients, indicating a persistent practice rather than an isolated incident. This demonstrates a failure to comply with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller could not demonstrate compliance with GDPR requirements.

7. The Italian DPA's notification under Article 58(2) reflects the supervisory authority's assessment that the controller's processing activities infringed upon the GDPR, particularly concerning the security and confidentiality obligations.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality), Article 32 (security of processing), and Article 9 (processing of special category data without appropriate safeguards)."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a municipality-run educational institution (the controller) processed the personal data of its students for the marketing of courses offered by a third party without the consent of its students. The DPA asked the controller to explain the purpose of the personal data processing.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that a teacher had sent the students an email in which the teacher advertised their own course in another organisation. The controller emphasised that sending the email in question was not related to the activities of the controller.

The controller claimed that the email in question had been sent against the controller's instructions. According to the controller's privacy notice, personal data was not disclosed to third parties for direct marketing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves a municipality-run educational institution acting as a controller processing personal data of its students, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 4(7) and Article 2(1).

2. The controller processed personal data (student email addresses) for marketing purposes without obtaining consent, which violates Article 6(1)(a) requiring lawful basis for processing, and specifically fails to meet the conditions for consent under Article 7 and Article 4(11).

3. The controller's privacy notice stated that personal data would not be disclosed to third parties for direct marketing, yet processing occurred for this purpose, violating Article 13(1)(c) which requires controllers to inform data subjects about the purposes of processing at the time of data collection.

4. The teacher, as a person acting under the authority of the controller per Article 29, processed personal data outside the controller's instructions, making the controller responsible for this unauthorized processing under Article 24(1) which requires implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure processing complies with the Regulation.

5. The processing for marketing purposes without consent constitutes a violation of the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), and the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b) as the data was processed for a purpose incompatible with the original educational purposes.

6. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2) by not preventing the unauthorized processing by its employee and not having adequate measures in place to ensure processing only on instructions from the controller.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including lack of lawful basis for processing, failure to adhere to stated privacy notices, insufficient organizational measures to prevent unauthorized processing, and breaches of core data protection principles."
"Following several compaints, the DPA launched an ""ex officio"" investigation. The controller (Client 1, Pitagorasz Oktatási Stúdió Kft) organises preparation courses for entry exams to secondary schools. It sent letters to students of different age (who are probably interested in applying for an entry exam), addressed to the students but mentioning that they are destined (also) to their caretakers. The addresses were received from the official government register, quoting as purpose market research. There is a law enabling this, but since 2019, this is not possible for direct marketing in respect of private individuals. The letters were sent after the registration to the courses was closed. Parents were informed about the source of the data at the bottom of the letters, and that the use of the data was terminated when the letter was forwarded. The information on the letter and in the legal basis could give the impression that this was an official communication and based on a legal obligation. The letter itself did not contain a market research questionnaire and could not be returned by mail. It hinted to an on line questionnaire which could be filled in. The privacy statement was not provided, it was only mentioned that it is available on the homepage of the controller (not a specific link to the statement itself). The information on the privacy statement mixed the processing of addresses used for sending the letters, the processing of registrations and of responses to the on line questionnaire. Different pieces of information (registration form, privacy statement etc.) contained differing information as to the legal basis of processing. The information given for consent was incomplete. The DPA acquired information from the provider of a mailing software and database used. It was established that this provider did not have access to the personal data, was neither controller, nor processor. The DPA investigated the database and found data of different groups of data subjects in it, including those who filled in the on line questionnaire, registrants and even lecturers. Not all data were collected on line, some were entered into the database manually. The fact of consent was not indicated at all data subjects whose data were processed based on consent. An assessment of interest was not conducted for the processing based on legitimate interest. Data of data subjects who meanwhile withdrew consent (were inactive) were not removed in time and were found in the database. Controller also enabled registrations to a newsletter and to send information about course organisation but did not separate the consent to these two different purposes.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 17","1. The controller (Pitagorasz Oktatási Stúdió Kft) processed personal data of students obtained from a government register for marketing purposes under the guise of ""market research,"" despite a 2019 law prohibiting such use for direct marketing to private individuals, violating the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6, as no valid legal basis was established for this processing.

2. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects as required by Articles 12, 13, and 14. The privacy statement was not directly provided with the communication (only referenced via a general homepage link), and the information mixed different processing purposes (marketing letters, registrations, questionnaires), failing to clearly specify the purposes and legal bases for each processing activity, which undermines the fairness and transparency principles.

3. The controller processed data based on consent but did not properly obtain or manage it: consent was not clearly indicated in records, purposes were not separated (e.g., newsletter vs. course information), and withdrawal of consent was not promptly acted upon (data not erased), violating Articles 6(1)(a), 7, and 17(1)(b) on conditions for consent and the right to erasure.

4. The controller claimed legitimate interest as a legal basis for some processing but failed to conduct a proper assessment of interests as required under Article 6(1)(f), violating the accountability principle in Article 5(2) and the need to demonstrate compliance.

5. The controller retained personal data beyond necessary periods (e.g., data of inactive users or those who withdrew consent were not promptly removed), contravening the storage limitation principle in Article 5(1)(e) and the right to erasure under Article 17.

6. The communication to data subjects (letters) created a misleading impression of being official or legally required, which is inconsistent with the transparency principle and the requirement to clearly identify the controller and purposes under Articles 12 and 13.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations across key principles and obligations, including lawfulness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, storage limitation, and accountability."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a school (the controller) had requested the guardians of all its students to provide the students' bank account numbers for the payment of a possible scholarship. The DPA had asked the controller to explain for what purpose it processed the bank account numbers of all its students.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that scholarships were normally physically awarded to the recipients at the end of the semester. Due to the pandemic, it was decided to pay the scholarship directly to the student's bank account. The controller also stated that it did not want to reveal in advance which students will receive the scholarships. Thus, to speed up the process, the controller had requested the bank account numbers of all its students.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 58","1. The case involves a school (the controller) processing personal data, specifically bank account numbers of all students, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR, as it relates to identifiable natural persons.

2. The controller processed this data for the purpose of paying scholarships, which is a specified purpose, but collecting bank account numbers from all students, including those who may not receive scholarships, violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, which requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.

3. Additionally, the collection of bank account numbers from all students exceeds what is necessary for the purpose of scholarship payments, as only a subset of students will actually receive scholarships, thereby potentially violating the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), which requires that personal data be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.

4. The controller's justification—that they did not want to reveal scholarship recipients in advance to speed up the process—does not override the data minimization principle, as alternative methods (e.g., requesting bank account numbers only after scholarship decisions are made) could achieve the same goal without unnecessary data collection, in line with the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

5. Under Article 6 of the GDPR, processing must be based on a lawful basis, such as consent or legitimate interests. However, even if a lawful basis is claimed, the processing must still comply with the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, which it does not in this case.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."
"A healthcare provider (the controller) had submitted a data breach notification to the Finnish DPA, according to which the CEO had left their bag outside without supervision and the bag had been stolen. Inside the bag was a laptop, external hard drives and paper documents containing, among other things, patients' health data.

The controller stated that the laptop was turned off and the login was protected with a password, but the laptop's mass storage or the personal data it contained had not been encrypted. The external hard drives contained backups of the controller's system, which were likely encrypted.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves a healthcare provider processing special categories of personal data (health data) under Article 9(1), which requires higher protection standards due to its sensitive nature.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical measures to ensure security of processing as required by Article 32(1), which specifically mentions encryption as an appropriate measure for ensuring security of personal data.

3. The unencrypted laptop containing health data was stolen, constituting a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it resulted in accidental destruction, loss, and unauthorized access to personal data.

4. The controller violated the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.""

5. The breach involved health data, which is a special category under Article 9(1), requiring additional safeguards that were not implemented (encryption of storage devices).

6. While the external hard drives were likely encrypted, the primary storage device (laptop) containing health data was not encrypted, demonstrating insufficient technical measures under Article 32(1).

7. The controller failed to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25, which requires appropriate technical measures (such as encryption) to be implemented at the time of determining the means for processing.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations of security obligations and principles regarding the processing of special category data."
"In 2023, as part of a wider initiative led by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA) like the majority of the members of the EDPB, jointly undertook the examination of the topic ""The definition and position of the data protection officer"". To facilitate this examination, the EDPB developed a unified questionnaire, which the Hellenic DPA adopted. Later on May 3, 2023, the Hellenic DPA exercising its investigative powers sent the questionnaire to 31 public bodies in Greece, including the Municipality of Athens (hereinafter ""Controller""), with a deadline for submission via the EUsurvey link until May 19, 2023.

The DPO of the Controller (hereinafter “DPO"") failed to respond to the questionnaire within the set deadline. The Hellenic DPA re-sent the questionnaire on May 26, 2023, with a new deadline of May 31, 2023. Once again, the DPO failed to respond in time. The DPO, after the deadline expired, attempted to complete the form without success as the above link had been deactivated by the Hellenic DPA. Upon DPO’s communication with Hellenic DPA, the link was reactivated, and the data controller was informed of a new deadline for submission until June 21, 2023. Once again, the DPO failed to submit the questionnaire in time.

The controller was then summoned by the Hellenic DPA to appear before the plenary on Tuesday, December 19, 2023. The DPO contacted the DPA by telephone and informed that he had inadvertently failed to respond due to technical issues and undertook to complete and submit it immediately. After which, the Hellenic DPA reactivated the submission link to the questionnaire, and the controller finally submitted the questionnaire on December 18, 2023. At the plenary meeting, which was held in person, the DPO stated once again that the reason for the delayed response was technical issues with the website where the questionnaire was held, which prevented submission even after several attempts.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 31, Article 37, Article 38, Article 39","1. The case involves the Municipality of Athens as a controller and its Data Protection Officer (DPO) failing to respond to a questionnaire from the Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA) within multiple specified deadlines, despite extensions and reactivation of the submission link.

2. Under Article 37 of the policy, public authorities like the Municipality of Athens are required to designate a Data Protection Officer. The DPO has specific tasks outlined in Article 39, which include cooperating with the supervisory authority (in this case, the HDPA) and acting as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing.

3. Article 31 of the policy explicitly states that ""The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks."" This places a direct obligation on the controller (Municipality of Athens) and its DPO to cooperate with the HDPA's investigation.

4. The DPO's repeated failures to respond to the questionnaire by the specified deadlines (May 19, May 31, and June 21, 2023) constitute a violation of the cooperation requirement under Article 31. The submission was only made after the controller was summoned to appear before the plenary, indicating persistent non-cooperation.

5. The DPO's claims of technical issues do not absolve the controller of its obligations under Article 31, as the policy does not provide for technical difficulties as a valid excuse for non-compliance with supervisory authority requests. The HDPA demonstrated flexibility by reactivating the link multiple times and extending deadlines, which the controller still failed to meet.

6. Therefore, the case demonstrates a clear failure by the controller (through its DPO) to cooperate with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks, in violation of Article 31 of the policy.

7. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"On 03.05.2023 the HDPA sent a single questionnaire to be completed on the designation and position of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) to selected public bodies, such as the Ministry of Rural Development and Food. The deadline for submission of the questionnaire was set for 19 May 2023. The Ministry of Rural Development and Food did not submit the questionnaire on time and a new closing date of 31.05.2023 was set. Despite being urged by the authority, the questionnaire was not submitted. The authority was informed that during the concerned period, the Ministry of Rural Development and Food was in the process of designating a DPO.

On 28.11.2023, the authority sent a summons to the Ministry of Rural Development and Food to be heard on 19.12.2023. The Ministry of Rural Development and Food in a memorandum clarified that the contract of the DPO of the Ministry had expired on 04. 08.2022, while a new DPO was appointed on 20.06.2023; in the interim period, during which there was no designated DPO, it was stated that a personal data protection and security plan was in place and that the data subjects did not suffer any harm. Further, they claimed that an employee of the Directorate of Administrative Organization and Supervision of Legal Entities of the Ministry after receiving the second letter on 26.05.2023 immediately proceeded to complete and submit the questionnaire, which could not be done due to a technical error.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 31, Article 37, Article 38, Article 39","1. The case involves the Ministry of Rural Development and Food, a public authority, which qualifies as a controller under the policy's definition (Article 4(7)), making it subject to the Regulation's requirements.

2. According to Article 37(1)(a), public authorities must designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO). The Ministry's DPO contract expired on 04.08.2022, and a new DPO was not appointed until 20.06.2023, leaving a period of approximately 10 months without a designated DPO, which violates the mandatory requirement.

3. Article 31 requires controllers to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request. The HDPA sent a questionnaire on 03.05.2023 with a deadline of 19.05.2023, which the Ministry failed to meet. Despite an extension to 31.05.2023 and subsequent urging, the Ministry did not submit the required information, demonstrating non-cooperation.

4. The Ministry's claim of a ""technical error"" preventing submission does not absolve it of its accountability obligations under Article 5(2), which requires controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the Regulation.

5. The Ministry's assertion that a data protection plan was in place and no harm occurred does not mitigate the violation, as the designation of a DPO is a mandatory structural requirement under Article 37, not contingent on actual harm or interim measures.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to failures to designate a DPO as required (Article 37) and to cooperate with the supervisory authority (Article 31)."
"The controller, Klarna Bank AB, commonly referred to as Klarna, is a Swedish fintech company that provides online financial services. The company provides payment processing services for the e-commerce industry, managing store claims and customer payments. The company is a ""buy now, pay later"" service provider.

A Klarna Bank AB customer in Germany contacted the controller in June 2020 to rectify their registered email address as per Article 16 GDPR.

The controller’s customer service initially replied to the data subject that changing the email address was technically impossible as it was associated with the their credit card. The controller encouraged them to create a new Klarna account to change their email address. A new Klarna account would however influence the claimant’s credit standing. Klarna stated that email addresses were used as personal identifiers, and as part of a verification proces. This is why, if the data subject wanted to update their email address, a new Klarna account, which would be associated new email, would have to be created.

In July 2020, the claimant requested the deletion of their personal data including the destruction of the Klarna account. As the data subject still had open invoices on their Klarna account, the controller deleted the account and added his new e-mail as an internal reference for the unpaid invoices.

The data subject complained to a German supervisory authority about the inadequate fulfilment of their right to rectification in Article 16 GDPR. On the basis of Article 56 GDPR the complaint was passed on to Swedish DPA ('IMY') as the LSA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 16, Article 25, Article 56, Article 58","1. The case involves Klarna Bank AB as a data controller processing personal data of a data subject in Germany, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3 due to the offering of services to data subjects in the Union.

2. The data subject exercised their right to rectification under Article 16 GDPR by requesting correction of their email address. Article 16 requires controllers to rectify inaccurate personal data without undue delay.

3. Klarna's response that changing the email address was ""technically impossible"" and their requirement for the data subject to create a new account violates Article 16, as controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to facilitate data subject rights under Article 12(2) and ensure data accuracy under Article 5(1)(d).

4. The controller's suggestion to create a new account would negatively impact the data subject's credit standing, potentially violating the principle of fair processing under Article 5(1)(a) and failing to protect the data subject's interests.

5. When the data subject subsequently requested erasure under Article 17, Klarna deleted the account but retained the email address as an internal reference for unpaid invoices. This processing of email data for debt collection purposes after account deletion requires a valid legal basis under Article 6, which Klarna failed to demonstrate.

6. The retention of the email address as an internal reference after account deletion may violate the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), as personal data should not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which they are processed.

7. The Swedish DPA (IMY) as the lead supervisory authority under Article 56 found that Klarna failed to properly fulfill the data subject's right to rectification and imposed an administrative fine, indicating violation of multiple GDPR provisions.

8. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 5, 12, 16, and potentially 6 and 17 of GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 20 September 2021, following the Taliban's ascent to power, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) sent an email to a list of individuals eligible for evacuation from Afghanistan using the ‘To’ field rather than the ‘blind carbon copy’ (‘Bcc’) field. Following this incident, the MoD identified that two similar incidents involving the staff in charge of the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy had already occurred.  Overall, 265 unique email addresses were disclosed.

The UK DPA (Information Commissioner's Office, ICO) started and investigation and found that the email addresses could be seen by all recipients, with 55 people having thumbnail pictures on their email profiles. Additionally, MoD confirmed that two people ‘replied all’ to the entire list of recipients, with one of them providing their location.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as a data controller processing personal data (email addresses) of individuals eligible for evacuation from Afghanistan, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2.

2. The MoD disclosed 265 unique email addresses to all recipients by using the 'To' field instead of 'Bcc', making these addresses visible to unauthorized parties. This constitutes unauthorized disclosure of personal data, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security [...] including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing.""

3. The incident represents a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it involved ""unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data."" The MoD failed to implement appropriate technical measures (such as using Bcc) to prevent such unauthorized disclosure, violating Article 32(1), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

4. The disclosure of email addresses, some with thumbnail pictures and additional information provided through ""reply all"" responses, increased the risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms, particularly given the vulnerable context of evacuation from Afghanistan. This violates the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25, which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical measures to effectively implement data protection principles.

5. The fact that similar incidents had occurred previously indicates a failure by the MoD to learn from past breaches and implement corrective measures, violating the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the requirement under Article 32(1) to review and update security measures where necessary.

6. The MoD's actions also potentially violated Article 34, as the breach was likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects (given the sensitive context), yet there is no indication that affected individuals were informed without undue delay.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the controller (Lääkäriklinikka Estetic Oy, a medical clinic) had refused to provide patient records to the data subject despite an access request pursuant to Article 15 GDPR. The DPA had asked the controller to explain why it had refused to fulfil the data subject's request.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the data subject had been treated at the controller's premises by a surgeon from another company, which is an independent controller of its patient records. The controller does not have access to that company's patient records.

The controller stated its patients may access their personal data by visiting the controller's premises and that the personal data is not sent by email. The controller also claimed that it had already provided the requested personal data to the data subject.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 15, Article 25, Article 58, Article 83","1. The data subject made an access request to the controller (Lääkäriklinikka Estetic Oy) pursuant to Article 15 GDPR, which grants the right to obtain confirmation and access to personal data processed by the controller.

2. The controller refused to provide the patient records, claiming that the records are held by another company (the surgeon's company) which is an independent controller, and that the controller does not have access to those records.

3. Under Article 15 GDPR, the controller is obligated to provide access to personal data that they process themselves, irrespective of whether another controller also processes data related to the data subject. The refusal based on another controller's involvement is not a valid ground for denial under GDPR.

4. Article 12 GDPR requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15-22 and not refuse requests unless they demonstrate that they are not in a position to identify the data subject (as per Article 11(2)). The controller did not claim an inability to identify the data subject, so the refusal violates Article 12.

5. The controller stated that patients may access personal data by visiting the premises, but Article 15(3) GDPR specifies that if the request is made by electronic means, the information should be provided in a commonly used electronic form, unless otherwise requested by the data subject. The controller's policy of not sending data by email may violate this if the request was electronic.

6. The controller claimed that they had already provided the requested personal data, but the Finnish DPA was notified of a refusal, indicating a contradiction and potential failure to provide complete access, which undermines the controller's compliance with Article 15.

7. Based on the above, the controller failed to comply with the obligations under Articles 12 and 15 GDPR by refusing the access request without valid justification and not facilitating the data subject's rights appropriately.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a provider of first aid training (""controller"") had requested the data subject to submit by email a signed form and a copy of their ID in order to exercise the right of access. The data subject made an access request but did not provide the filled in form and a copy of their ID. Therefore, the controller did not provide access to the personal data.

The DPA had asked the controller to explain how it facilitated the exercise of data subject rights. In addition, the DPA also asked the controller to clarify how long it retained personal data.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it could not confirm the identity of the data subject because the access request had been submitted by email, which only contained the name and email address of the data subject. Therefore, the controller could not fulfill the request, because the data subject had not agreed to submit the signed information request form or to identify themselves as requested by the controller.

Concerning the retention periods, the controller stated that the completed training was valid for three years and that the personal data would be erased two years after the end of the validity period.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 25, Article 58","1. The case involves a data subject making an access request under Article 15 of the GDPR to a controller (first aid training provider), and the controller requiring additional identification documents (signed form and ID copy) to process this request.

2. According to Article 12(2) of the GDPR, the controller must facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and shall not refuse to act on the request unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject. The controller in this case did not demonstrate that the email (containing name and email address) was insufficient for identification purposes, but instead imposed additional requirements without justification.

3. Article 11 states that if the purposes for processing do not require identification, the controller should not process additional information to identify the data subject solely for compliance with the Regulation. The controller did not establish that identification was necessary for their processing purposes before requiring additional identification documents.

4. The controller's requirement for a signed form and ID copy exceeds the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and imposes unnecessary barriers to exercising data subject rights, contrary to the obligation to facilitate rights under Article 12(2).

5. Regarding retention periods, the controller stated personal data is kept for two years after the three-year validity period of training. Under Article 5(1)(e), personal data must be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary. The controller provided no justification for this specific retention period, potentially violating storage limitation principles.

6. The controller's failure to properly facilitate the access request and demonstrate why standard communication (email) was insufficient for identification constitutes a violation of Articles 11, 12(2), and 15 of the GDPR.

"The Finnish DPA was notified that a travel agency (the controller) processed visa application data without encryption and had not responded to the data subject's request to erase their personal data. The DPA had asked the controller to explain how it processed personal data and why it had refused to comply with the data subject's request.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it had provided visa application services, in connection with which various personal data had been collected, such as the name, contact details and passport number of the visa applicant. The operations of the controller had ceased in July 2021, and it had no staff who could have been in contact with the data subject.

The controller stated that it was a part of a small travel industry group but emphasised that the other group companies did not supervise the personal data processing carried out by the controller. However, the controller considered that the personal data of the data subject had been partially erased from its system.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 17, Article 25, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a travel agency (the controller) processing personal data related to visa applications, including sensitive information such as passport numbers, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller processed visa application data without encryption, violating Article 32(1)(a), which requires implementing appropriate technical measures such as encryption to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, especially given the sensitivity of passport data and the risks of unauthorized access.

3. The controller failed to respond to the data subject's request for erasure of their personal data, violating Article 17(1), which grants data subjects the right to obtain erasure of personal data without undue delay under certain conditions, and Article 12(3), which requires the controller to provide information on action taken regarding such requests without undue delay and within one month.

4. The controller's cessation of operations and lack of staff does not exempt it from GDPR obligations, as Article 5(2) (accountability principle) requires controllers to remain responsible for and demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, including data security and responding to data subject requests, regardless of operational status.

5. The controller's claim that personal data was ""partially erased"" is insufficient under Article 17(1), which mandates complete erasure where grounds for erasure apply (e.g., data no longer necessary for the purposes collected), and Article 19, which requires notification of erasure to recipients of the data unless disproportionate effort is proven.

6. The controller's emphasis that other group companies did not supervise its processing does not absolve it of responsibility; under Article 24, the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, which includes having mechanisms to handle data subject requests even after operations cease.

7. The failures to encrypt data, fully erase data, and respond to the data subject's request collectively violate multiple GDPR provisions, including Articles 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality), 17, 19, and 32, leading to a conclusion of noncompliance.

"Electricité de France (hereinafter referred to as the EDF company or the company) is an entity active on the electricity markets—in particular, in the production of electricity, and the wholesale, trading, transportation, distribution, and supply of electricity. In its business activities, the company processed personal data of its customers and prospects (i.e. data controller). At the end of 2020, EDF had 25.7 million customers in its databases. The National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (hereinafter referred to as the CNIL or the Commission) received numerous complaints against the company relating to the exercise of rights between August 2019 and December 2020.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 21, Article 32","1. The case involves Electricité de France (EDF) as a data controller processing personal data of its customers and prospects, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2.

2. The CNIL received numerous complaints against EDF relating to the exercise of data subject rights between August 2019 and December 2020, indicating potential violations of Articles 12-22 which govern data subject rights.

3. Article 12 requires controllers to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and provide information on action taken without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request, with possible extension by two further months where necessary.

4. The high volume of complaints (25.7 million customers in databases with numerous rights exercise complaints) suggests systematic failures in EDF's processes for handling data subject requests, potentially violating Article 12's requirements for timely responses and proper facilitation of rights.

5. Article 15 establishes the right of access by data subjects, requiring controllers to provide confirmation of processing and access to personal data. The complaints indicate EDF may have failed to properly respond to access requests.

6. Article 17 establishes the right to erasure ('right to be forgotten'), requiring controllers to erase personal data without undue delay under specific circumstances. The complaints suggest EDF may not have properly handled erasure requests.

7. Article 21 establishes the right to object to processing, including for direct marketing purposes. The complaints may indicate EDF failed to properly honor objections to processing.

8. The sustained pattern of complaints over more than a year (August 2019 to December 2020) suggests these were not isolated incidents but represented systemic compliance failures, violating the accountability principle in Article 5(2) which requires controllers to demonstrate compliance.

9. The failure to properly handle data subject rights requests constitutes a violation of multiple articles (12-22) of the Regulation, which according to Article 83(5) can result in administrative fines up to €20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"On 23 September 2021, the French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out an inspection on Foriou’s premises (“controller”), in particular regarding the legal basis of the processing and the security measures taken. The controller was in the business of marketing and managing loyalty programs and cards. In order to promote its programs, until 2021, the controller carried out telephone canvassing campaigns using prospect files purchased with several data suppliers who collected the data via entry forms for online competitions. The personal data collected was the following: surname, first name, title, email address, date of birth and postal address.

During its investigations, the CNIL discovered that the data suppliers all had similar forms on their websites: there were fields which enabled the data subject to enter their contact details. Underneath these fields were a “Validate”, “I validate” or “I answer questions to apply” button. Above or below this button, a text specified that by clicking on it, the user declared that they read the data supplier’s data protection policy and accepts that the data collected would be used to send them offers from the company’s partners. Hyperlinks were provided to access the data protection policy as well as the list of partners concerned. However, the list did not mention the controller. At the end of the text it was specified that if the user wished to continue without receiving offers from the data supplier’s partners, they could click a link in the text (“click here”).

Therefore, data subjects could either click on the “Validate” button and accept that their data would be used to send them offers from the data supplier’s partners or on the “click here” link to continue without receiving these offers.

The controller also submitted 2 other forms in its observations. These forms contained “Validate my coordinates” and “Continue” buttons to validate participation in the game and transmit data to partners. The “click here” button remained unchanged and was still presented in the body of the text.

Regarding security measures, the CNIL found that the controller indicated that they would keep customer data for a period of 5 years from the date of the end of the contract in an active database with no intermediate archiving mechanism implemented.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal data (surname, first name, title, email address, date of birth, and postal address) by Foriou, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing.

2. The controller relied on consent as the legal basis for processing personal data obtained from data suppliers, as evidenced by the forms requiring users to accept partner offers by clicking a validation button (Article 6(1)(a)).

3. Under Article 4(11), consent must be a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes. The forms presented to users did not meet this standard because:
   - The list of partners did not include Foriou, meaning users were not specifically informed that their data would be shared with this controller (violating Article 13(1)(c) and Article 13(1)(e), which require clear information about the controller's identity and the purposes of processing).
   - The option to avoid partner offers was presented through a ""click here"" link, which is not equivalent to an explicit opt-in mechanism, potentially leading to invalid consent under Article 7(2) and Recital 32.

4. The consent mechanism also failed to meet the conditions in Article 7(1), as the controller could not demonstrate that consent was freely given. The design of the forms—with a prominent validation button and a less visible opt-out link—likely created an imbalance that pressured users to accept, contrary to the requirement for freely given consent.

5. Regarding data retention, the controller stored customer data for 5 years in an active database without intermediate archiving, violating the storage limitation principle in Article 5(1)(e). Personal data must be kept in a form that permits identification for no longer than necessary, and appropriate archiving or pseudonymization measures should be implemented to comply with this principle.

6. The controller's failure to implement adequate security measures, such as archiving, also contravenes Article 32(1), which requires appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to invalid consent mechanisms and insufficient data retention practices."
"On 22 October 2018, UniCredit S.p.A. (""controller"") notified the Italian DPA of a personal data breach that occurred on 21 October 2018. The breach occurred due to a cyberattack on the controller’s mobile banking portal for customers. Third parties tried to access customer accounts by attempting automatically-generated simple PINs.

The mobile banking portal had two vulnerabilities that facilitated the breach. First, the portal made customers’ personal data (first name, surname, tax code, and internal bank identification code) available in HTML responses to authentication attempts, including where attempts were unsuccessful. Second, the controller did not limit the use of simple PINs, making accounts vulnerable to cyberattacks aimed at identifying customer login information (brute force attacks).

Due to the HTML response vulnerability, every login attempt gave cyber attackers access to the names, tax codes, and internal bank identification codes of 777,765 present and former customers. In the case of 6,959 of those customers, the cyber attackers also successfully identified the portal PINs. The controller subsequently blocked the identified PINs. The breach did not include the data subjects’ banking data.

The controller did not consider the breach high-risk pursuant to Article 34 GDPR. It posted a general notice on its website and gave direct notice only to the 6,959 data subjects whose passwords were identified. The DPA disagreed, finding the breach likely to present a high risk to data subject rights after a preliminary investigation. On 13 December 2018, it enjoined the controller to communicate the personal data breach to all data subjects. The controller subsequently prepared differentiated notices, which the DPA found complied with Article 34(2) GDPR.

In a defense brief, the controller argued that it took preventive measures and mitigating controls which exceeded market standards at the time of the breach. Additionally, the controller argued that the breach occurred as a result of its data processor’s negligence. The processor was charged with carrying out vulnerability tests on the controller’s mobile webpage and application. Though it became aware of the mobile portal’s vulnerabilities on 19 October 2018 and identified them as high-level, the processor did not report these to the controller until 22 October 2018.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 34","1. The case involves a personal data breach at UniCredit S.p.A. (""controller"") where cyber attackers accessed personal data of 777,765 customers due to vulnerabilities in the mobile banking portal, making this a processing incident subject to GDPR regulations (Article 4(12) defining ""personal data breach"").

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) GDPR. Specifically, the portal vulnerabilities (exposing personal data in HTML responses and not limiting simple PINs) constituted inadequate security measures against unauthorized access.

3. Regarding breach notification, the controller complied with Article 33(1) by notifying the Italian DPA within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach on 22 October 2018.

4. However, the controller violated Article 34(1) by not communicating the breach to all affected data subjects without undue delay. The controller only provided direct notice to the 6,959 subjects whose PINs were compromised, despite the DPA determining the breach likely presented a high risk to all 777,765 affected data subjects.

5. The controller's argument that preventive measures exceeded market standards is invalid under Article 32(1), which requires measures appropriate to the risk, not merely market standards. The vulnerabilities demonstrated inadequate security measures.

6. The controller's attempt to shift responsibility to the processor fails under Article 28(1) and Article 82(2), as controllers remain ultimately responsible for ensuring processors provide sufficient guarantees and comply with GDPR obligations. The controller's duty to ensure processor compliance is non-delegable.

7. The breach involved personal data (names, tax codes, internal bank codes) that could be linked to identifiable natural persons (Article 4(1)), and the exposure created risks of identity theft or fraud, constituting a high risk to rights and freedoms under Article 34(1).

8. The controller's website notice alone did not satisfy Article 34(2), which requires direct communication when feasible, especially given the large number of affected data subjects and sensitivity of the exposed information.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to failures in security measures (Article 32), inadequate breach communication to data subjects (Article 34), and attempted improper delegation of responsibility to the processor (Articles 28 and 82)."
"The Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs ('Minister') informed the DPA that the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland ('Consulate') sent, at the request of the District Court of Kraków ('Court'), correspondence through a postal operator to an addressee.

The addressee informed the Consulate that a delivered parcel was damaged, additionally wrapped and was incomplete. The infringement covered a various categories of personal data, namely first and last names, ID numbers, addresses of residence, dates of birth, bank account numbers, photographs. Personal data of two children were also breached.

The DPA identified the court as a controller of the data affected by the breach. It invited the Court to indicate whether a risk analysis had been done to assess whether a data protection breach required notifying the DPA and the affected individuals under Articles 33 and 34 GDPR. In its defence, the court referred to Article 175dd of the Law on the Common Court System, stating that the District Court of Kraków, under the President of the Court of Appeal in Krakow, is responsible for overseeing data processing in court proceedings and legal protection tasks.

As a response, the DPA clarified that it was the competent authority to investigate the infringement in question.

However, the Court reiterated its stance, referencing various articles of the Law on the System of Common Courts and a decision by the CJEU from March 24, 2022 (Case C-245/20). The Court emphasized that the protection of judicial independence is paramount, stating that judicial functions should be exercised independently without external interference or pressure. They asserted that the administration of justice encompasses all operations related to judicial activities, including informing parties about court proceedings.  Additionally, the Court referenced a decision by the DPA (no. ZSOŚS.440.109.2018) regarding the authority's reluctance to interfere with documents collected in court proceedings. Consequently, they argued that the DPA lacks the authority to control courts in matters related to adjudicatory activities.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 55","1. The case involves a data breach where personal data (including names, ID numbers, addresses, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and photographs) was compromised during transmission by the District Court of Kraków (Court) via postal services, affecting both adults and children (Article 4 definitions of ""personal data"" and ""processing"").

The Court, as the controller of the affected data (as identified by the DPA), failed to notify the supervisory authority (DPA) of the personal data breach without undue delay and within 72 hours of awareness, as required under Article 33(1) of the GDPR, and did not communicate the breach to the data subjects under Article 34(1) when it was likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms.
3. The Court defended its inaction by citing national law (Article 175dd of the Law on the Common Court System) and judicial independence, arguing that the DPA lacks authority over courts in matters related to adjudicatory activities. However, GDPR Article 55(3) states that supervisory authorities are not competent to supervise processing operations of courts acting in their judicial capacity, but this exception does not extend to administrative or operational tasks such as data transmission via postal services, which are separable from judicial functions.
4. The processing activity in question (sending correspondence via postal operator) is an administrative task supporting judicial activities but does not constitute ""acting in a judicial capacity"" as referenced in Article 55(3). Therefore, the DPA retains competence to investigate this breach under Articles 57 and 58.
5. The Court's reference to CJEU Case C-245/20 and prior DPA decisions does not override the GDPR's applicability, as Article 2(1) confirms the Regulation applies to processing by automated means or as part of a filing system, which includes the Court's data handling in this context. National laws cannot derogate from GDPR obligations unless explicitly provided for in specific articles (e.g., Article 6(2) or Article 23), which were not invoked or justified here.
6. By failing to conduct a risk analysis and notify the breach, the Court violated Articles 33 and 34, and its refusal to cooperate with the DPA's investigation contravenes Article 31, which mandates cooperation with supervisory authorities.
7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The Medtronic Diabetes is a medical technology firm focused on innovation of diabetes solutions such as developing the MiniMed Mobile app which displays insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring data. The app offers a direct connection with patient's healthcare provider through a 'CareLink' Personal software.

The team member of the firm emailed users of the MiniMed Mobile app in different countries within and outside the EU. The purpose was to notify them about a server maintenance update and the steps needed to regain access to the 'CareLink' Personal software as part of this update.

The member of the team included the recipients’ e-mail addresses in the ‘To’ field instead of the ‘Bcc’ field which stands for ‘Blind Carbon Copy’. As a result, around 5,000 email addresses of MiniMed Mobile app users worldwide were exposed, including 732 in Italy.

The email notification didn't contain personal data, but recipients' email addresses were visible. Medtronic swiftly notified the breach to the Italian DPA, attempting to recall all emails and instructing affected users to delete them. After the incident, the controller re-trained staff on email notification procedures and started implementing an automated tool to prevent such incidents in the future.

These email addresses were in some cases made up of a combination of first name and surname of the data subject, which made it possible to identify the person in question, thus indirectly disclosing data relating to their health within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR. The controller stressed that the content of the e-mail did not include any personal data but revealed that the recipients were users of the MiniMed Mobile app.

Based on this notification of the incident, the DPA requested further preliminary information.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32","1. The case involves Medtronic Diabetes as a data controller processing personal data of MiniMed Mobile app users, including email addresses that in some cases contained combinations of first names and surnames, making them personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The exposure of email addresses through improper use of the 'To' field instead of 'Bcc' constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it led to the accidental disclosure of personal data to unauthorized recipients.

3. Some of the exposed email addresses made it possible to identify the data subjects and indirectly revealed that they were users of a diabetes management app, thus processing special categories of personal data (health data) under Article 9(1) without a lawful basis as required by Article 9(2).

4. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), particularly given the sensitive nature of the health data indirectly processed.

5. The breach notification to the Italian DPA was made, which is required under Article 33(1), but the preventive measures were insufficient to avoid the breach, indicating a failure in the controller's obligation to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

6. The controller's actions after the breach (re-training staff and implementing an automated tool) demonstrate attempts to mitigate future risks but do not rectify the initial noncompliance with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32, which require integrity and confidentiality of processing through appropriate security measures.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the controller (Verkkokauppa.com Oyj, an IT retailer) required customers to create a customer account in order to make online purchases. The DPA then asked the controller to explain why it required the creation of a customer account and for what purposes and for how long it stored the personal data of its customers.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the processing of customers' personal data was necessary for the provision of services and for the performance of a customer contract. The controller argued that it was able to reliably identify the data subject, demonstrate its accountability and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights through the customer account.

The controller explained that it sells long-life devices that may have very long warranty and defect liability periods. Therefore, it was in the customers' interest to have access to information and receipts regarding their online purchases through the customer account throughout the customer relationship.

The controller emphasised that if it allowed its customers to make online purchases without a customer account, it would have to process and store the personal data required for the placing and delivery of the order on an order-by-order basis, which would not be appropriate from a data security perspective and would not be in line with the principle of data minimisation.

The controller also stated that the contractual relationship was for an indefinite period, the duration of which was determined by the customer. Thus, the controller stored personal data until the customer account was deleted at the request of the data subject. The controller claimed that it was not in a position to assess on behalf of the customer how long the customer relationship should last.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves a controller (Verkkokauppa.com Oyj) processing personal data for online purchases, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The controller requires customers to create a customer account to make online purchases, claiming that this is necessary for the performance of a contract under Article 6(1)(b). However, the GDPR principles in Article 5 require that processing be lawful, fair, and transparent, and that data be minimized and stored only as long as necessary.

3. Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation) stipulates that personal data must be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed."" The controller's requirement of a customer account may not be necessary, as alternative methods (e.g., guest checkout) could process only transaction-specific data, thus better adhering to data minimisation.

4. Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation) requires that personal data be kept ""in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed."" The controller stores data indefinitely until the customer deletes the account, which exceeds the necessary period for contract performance, especially after warranty or defect liability periods expire, violating storage limitation.

5. Article 25 (data protection by design and by default) mandates that controllers implement measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose are processed. The controller should offer an option to purchase without an account to comply with this principle, but it does not, thereby failing to adhere to data protection by default.

6. The controller's argument that indefinite storage is in the customers' interest does not override its obligation under Article 5 to define a specific retention period based on the purpose (e.g., duration of warranties), as indefinite storage is inherently non-compliant with storage limitation.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c)), storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), and data protection by default (Article 25)."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the Finnish Motor Insurers' Centre (the controller) had requested unnecessary patient information from healthcare providers in order to settle claims. The DPA then asked the controller to explain how it processed patient information disclosed by healthcare providers for the purposes of settling claims.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that, according to Section 82 of the Finnish Motor Liability Insurance Act, it has the right, notwithstanding the obligation of confidentiality or other restrictions on access to information, to obtain statements made by healthcare providers and other information concerning the patients' medical records, health status, ability to work, treatment and rehabilitation.

The controller stated that it was impossible to process the claim without the claimants' medical records. The controller processed the patients' healthcare appointment data to determine whether the healthcare provider had charged for visits that were not related to the examination or treatment of injuries sustained in a traffic accident.

The controller emphasised that it followed the principle of data minimisation and that the patients’ healthcare appointment data were not requested unnecessarily. The controller also noted that it had to request a large amount of information in case the healthcare providers had omitted information necessary for claims handling.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves the Finnish Motor Insurers' Centre (controller) processing patients' healthcare data, including medical records and appointment information, for insurance claim settlement purposes, which constitutes processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller justified its processing activities under Section 82 of the Finnish Motor Liability Insurance Act, which permits access to medical information notwithstanding confidentiality obligations. However, under Article 6(3) of the GDPR, any Member State law providing the legal basis for processing must respect the essence of data protection principles and be proportionate.

3. The controller claimed it was impossible to process claims without complete medical records and argued it followed the principle of data minimization. However, its practice of routinely requesting ""a large amount of information in case healthcare providers had omitted information"" directly violates Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, which requires that personal data be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.""

4. The processing of health data, as a special category under Article 9(1), requires additional safeguards under Article 9(2). While Article 9(2)(f) allows processing necessary for legal claims, this must be applied proportionally. The controller's blanket approach to data collection without case-specific necessity fails to meet the requirement for targeted, minimal processing.

5. The controller's argument that it needed appointment data to verify billing relevance does not justify collecting entire medical records. More targeted approaches (e.g., requesting only treatment dates and types rather than full clinical records) would better align with the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) and the requirement under Article 25 to implement data protection by design and by default.

6. The verdict of NONCOMPLIANT is consistent with GDPR's overarching principle in Article 5(1)(c) that controllers must ensure data processing is limited to what is strictly necessary, particularly when handling sensitive health data under Article 9.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The National Council of Notaries (""the Council"") requested the DPA to investigate regarding the proper classification of the relationships between banks and notaries when, in the process of loan stipulation, certain lending banks utilize the services of a third-party company named ""Euro Servizi per i Notai S.r.l."" (""ESpN"") for managing document exchange with notaries through a platform known as PIGNA.

PIGNA is a service provided exclusively to banks by ESpN which is a computing service provider. It enabled banks and notaries, who handle tasks related to loan contracts and associated guarantees, to share required documents. This sharing occurred both before and after the contract was signed, except for a copy of the contract in enforceable form. Essentially, PIGNA facilitated the efficient exchange of necessary paperwork between these parties involved in the loan process.

Several concerns arose from the situation described. Firstly, the Council recommended an investigation with regards to the roles and responsibilities in the processing of personal data within the PIGNA platform. This includes notaries, banks, and ESpN. The concern revolved around the processing of personal data of borrowers, related third parties (like property sellers), and data concerning the notaries themselves.

Secondly, the relationship between PIGNA and individual notaries was unclear since notaries accessed the platform with authentication credentials provided by ESpN.

Thirdly, there were issues with the level of information provided to notaries and the sequence of notifications sent by PIGNA. It was highlighted that notaries receive a range of notifications via both the portal and email. In some instances, these notifications arrive unexpectedly, directly from the lending bank selected by the borrower. For instance, they may receive notice granting them authority to issue a mortgage loan, which is not necessarily communicated by the borrower's chosen lending bank.

Specifically, certain communications originating from platform accounts aim to offer notaries period report of borrower's personal data. These communications are accompanied by a table or Excel sheet detailing various deeds under scrutiny or completed, all linked to the same notary, concerning different banks. They include an internal reference code within the portal and identify the relevant party (the borrower).

Upon this request, the DPA conducted an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 14, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of personal data of borrowers and related third parties through the PIGNA platform managed by ESpN, with banks and notaries as involved parties, falling under the scope of GDPR as per Article 3 (territorial scope) and Article 2 (material scope), as the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of establishments in the Union.

2. ESpN acts as a processor for the banks by providing the PIGNA platform, but the investigation reveals that ESpN may be determining the purposes and means of processing beyond mere service provision, which would classify it as a controller under Article 4(7). However, there is no clear agreement or transparency regarding ESpN's role, violating Article 28(3) which requires a binding contract stipulating the subject-matter, duration, and obligations of the processor.

3. The relationship between notaries and ESpN is unclear, as notaries access the platform with credentials provided by ESpN without a defined data processing agreement or clear instructions from a controller, potentially making notaries processors themselves under Article 28, but without the required contractual safeguards, leading to noncompliance with Article 28(1)-(4).

4. The processing of personal data (e.g., borrower details, mortgage information) through PIGNA involves sharing data via notifications and Excel sheets without a lawful basis as per Article 6(1). Specifically, the unsolicited notifications from banks to notaries via the platform may not have obtained valid consent from data subjects (borrowers) or met another lawful condition, violating Article 6 and Article 7 (conditions for consent).

5. The information provided to notaries and data subjects regarding the processing is inadequate. Notaries receive unexpected communications and data reports without proper prior information, contravening Article 13 (information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject) and Article 14 (information where data have not been obtained from the data subject), as data subjects (borrowers) are likely not informed about the sharing of their data through PIGNA.

6. The sharing of personal data via Excel sheets and internal codes without appropriate security measures violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) and the security requirements under Article 32, which mandate implementing technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

7. The DPA's investigation confirms that the roles of controllers (banks and possibly notaries) and processors (ESpN) are not clearly defined, leading to a lack of accountability under Article 5(2) and noncompliance with the general principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of GDPR provisions, including unclear controller/processor roles, lack of lawful basis for processing, insufficient information to data subjects, and inadequate security measures."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a hospital had sent test results to its patients by SMS, including the patient's personal identification number. The DPA then asked the controller to explain the purpose of including personal identification numbers in text messages.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that its mobile service automatically sent test results, treatment instructions and a proposal for the next monitoring date to patients via SMS, for example, as follows: “[Patient ID]: [Test X] score is [Y] and everything is fine. Your next checkup is on [date]”. The controller stated that the inclusion of the personal identification number in the SMS ensured that the patient information was not inadvertently disclosed to the wrong persons with the same name.

The controller considered that in a service where the personal identification number is transmitted as a text message to the patient's own mobile phone, the risk related to the processing of the personal identification number is estimated to be low. On the other hand, if the SMS is targeted to the wrong person, the risks for the data subject can be considerably high.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 58, Article 87","1. The case involves a hospital (controller) processing personal data, including health data and national identification numbers, by sending SMS messages to patients, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 (definitions of 'personal data' and 'processing').

2. The processing involves special categories of personal data (health data) under Article 9(1), which is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller did not demonstrate that any specific condition under Article 9(2) was met for including the national identification number in the SMS.

3. The controller included the personal identification number to prevent misidentification, but Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation) requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes. The inclusion of the full national identification number is excessive when less identifying information could achieve the same purpose.

4. Article 32 (security of processing) requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Sending sensitive health data along with a national identification number via unencrypted SMS does not provide sufficient security, considering the high risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects if the message is misdirected.

5. The controller acknowledged that if an SMS is sent to the wrong person, the risks are high. This indicates that the processing operation poses a significant risk, yet the controller did not implement adequate safeguards, such as encryption or alternative secure communication methods, as required by Article 32.

6. Article 25 (data protection by design and by default) requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only necessary personal data are processed. The controller failed to demonstrate that the inclusion of the national identification number was necessary by default, especially when other less intrusive means could be used for identification.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c)), insufficient security measures (Article 32), and failure to adhere to data protection by design and by default (Article 25), particularly in the context of processing special categories of data (Article 9)."
"The controller is the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration.

The Norwegian DPA (“Datatilsynet”) audited the controller to check whether the controller ensured confidentiality in the management system used to process personal data to provide services. The audit was limited to the technical and organisational measures related to access management, logs and log control under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR. The audit also checked whether the controller established an appropriate management system under Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 83","1. The case involves the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2 (processing by automated means as part of a filing system).

2. The audit focused on whether the controller ensured confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which requires personal data to be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.""

3. The audit found inadequate technical and organisational measures related to access management and log control, specifically:
   - Insufficient access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to personal data
   - Inadequate logging and monitoring of access to personal data systems
   These deficiencies constitute a violation of Article 5(1)(f) as they fail to ensure appropriate security and confidentiality of personal data.

4. The controller also failed to demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2) GDPR, which requires the controller to ""be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with"" the data protection principles.

5. Regarding Article 32 GDPR on security of processing, the controller did not implement ""appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,"" particularly concerning:
   - The ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems
   - A process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical measures
   This represents a violation of Article 32(1) and (1)(d).

6. Under Article 24 GDPR, the controller failed to ""implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation,"" as evidenced by the inadequate access management and logging systems.

7. The deficiencies in access management and logging specifically violate the requirement under Article 32(4) that ""the controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller.""

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy due to multiple violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 24, and 32."
"The Worldcoin Foundation (the controller) used a phone application and in-person sites to engage in large-scale processing of biometric data, particularly irises, eyes and faces. The data was subsequently processed for various purposes including the creation of a digital identity profile (World ID).

On 10 August 2023, the Portuguese DPA (CNPD) initiated an investigation. The CNPD found that the controller had collected the biometric data of over 300,000 data subjects within Portugal. It noted in particular that the controller (1) collected biometric data of minors, (2) made it impossible to exercise the right to erasure of the collected data, (3) made it impossible to revoke consent, and (4) provided deficient information to data subjects.

The controller collected data initially through a phone application through which data subjects could create a World ID in order to use Worldcoin cryptocurrency. In order to ‘verify’ the World ID, data subjects were encouraged to visit the controller’s in-person stores so that a device called an ‘Orb’ could capture high-resolution images of their irises, eyes, and faces. The controller alleged that this ‘verification process’ was necessary to establish ‘proof of personhood’ and prevent duplication of World IDs. Orb operators were taught to encourage data subjects to consent to the storage and use of the biometric data. The controller offered tokens to encourage data subjects to provide their biometric data via the Orb, and offered financial rewards for them to invite others to have their biometric data collected.

In February and March 2024, the CNPD received reports from data subjects concerning mass collection of minors’ biometric information, the impossibility of exercising rights to erasure, and inadequate disclosure concerning risks of processing at the time of collection. The CNPD observed that there were no measures in place to verify data subjects’ ages. It noted that the controller’s consent forms expressly mentioned the impossibility of erasure and of revoking consent. Finally, it also considered that the declaration of consent was partially provided only in English.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 7, Article 9, Article 13, Article 17, Article 58","1. The case involves the Worldcoin Foundation as a controller processing biometric data (iris, eyes, faces) which qualifies as special category personal data under Article 9(1) due to its nature as biometric data for uniquely identifying natural persons.

2. The controller processed biometric data of minors without implementing age verification measures, violating Article 8(1) which requires parental authorization for processing personal data of children below 16 years in relation to information society services, and Article 9(2)(a) which requires explicit consent for processing special category data.

3. The controller made it impossible for data subjects to exercise their right to erasure under Article 17(1), which provides data subjects the right to obtain erasure of personal data without undue delay when consent is withdrawn (Article 17(1)(b)) or when data has been unlawfully processed (Article 17(1)(d)).

4. The controller made it impossible to revoke consent, violating Article 7(3) which explicitly states that ""the data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time"" and that ""it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.""

5. The controller provided deficient information to data subjects by offering consent declarations only in English rather than in the official language of Portugal where data collection occurred, violating Article 12(1) which requires information to be provided ""in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""

6. The controller's practice of offering financial incentives (tokens and rewards) for providing biometric data and recruiting others may undermine the validity of consent under Article 7(4), which states that ""utmost account shall be taken of whether... the performance of a contract... is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.""

7. The processing of biometric data on such a large scale (300,000+ data subjects in Portugal) without conducting a proper data protection impact assessment under Article 35(3) constitutes a violation, as processing of special category data on a large scale specifically requires such assessment.

8. The controller failed to implement data protection by design and by default measures under Article 25, particularly regarding age verification systems and mechanisms for facilitating data subject rights.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The controller, a housing association, installed 38 (active) video cameras and three dummy cameras at a residential complex after an increased number of break-ins in the basement. The cameras monitored the general areas, including entrance areas and bicycle/trash rooms. The apartment entrance doors and residents’ personal spaces were excluded from the cameras’ scope and/or rendered unrecognisable. The data subjects, the residents, were informed about this in a newsletter and on the notice board at the complex.

On 03 November 2022, the Austrian DPA (‘Datenschutzbehörde’) was anonymously informed about the video surveillance system. The DPA then conducted a data protection review in accordance with Article 57(1)(h) GDPR.

The controller argued that the video surveillance system was in the interest of protecting property against theft, damage, and other disruptions (in accordance with Austrian national law, Section 28 WEG) and preserving evidence thereof.  The recordings were stored for a maximum of 72 hours.

The controller further argued that although the data subjects had not given their consent, it was not necessary because the legitimate interest of the controller overrode the interests of the data subjects. The proper fulfilment of a contract was also present because the data subjects reported break-ins at the complex. The controller had an obligation to take preventative measures in order to avoid damage.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves a housing association (controller) processing personal data through video surveillance of common areas in a residential complex, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1), as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller claimed two legal bases for processing: legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) and contract performance under Article 6(1)(b). However, for legitimate interest to apply, the controller must demonstrate that its interests override the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, particularly considering residents' reasonable expectations of privacy in their residential environment (Recital 47). The Austrian DPA found the surveillance disproportionate as less intrusive measures were available, violating the necessity principle under Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization).

3. Regarding contract performance under Article 6(1)(b), the processing must be necessary for fulfilling the housing contract. The DPA determined that comprehensive video surveillance was not objectively necessary for contract performance, as alternative security measures could achieve the same purpose with less privacy intrusion.

4. The controller failed to conduct a proper balancing test between its interests and residents' fundamental rights under Article 6(1)(f), particularly ignoring the impact on residents' private lives in semi-private common areas, which violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

5. While the controller provided information about surveillance through newsletters and notice boards (attempting compliance with Articles 12-13), this does not rectify the unlawful basis for processing. Transparency obligations under Articles 12-14 are secondary to establishing a valid legal basis under Article 6.

6. The 72-hour storage period potentially complies with storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e), but this does not compensate for the lack of lawful processing basis.

7. The processing did not qualify under any exception for special category data under Article 9, though no sensitive data was specifically mentioned as being processed.

8. Consequently, the processing violated the core principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6, making the entire processing operation noncompliant regardless of other technical or organizational measures implemented.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"At the end of 2021, the Hellenic DPA (HDPA) became aware of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum's (the controller) development and deployment of the ""Centaurus"" and ""Hyperion"" Programmes Closed Control Facility Centres for third country nationals on the Aegean islands (Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos). The HDPA also received requests for an investigation and opinion from the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament, as well as from civil society organisations, on the use of the systems in the asylum facilities.

The Centaurus project is reportedly an integrated digital system for the management of electronic and physical security around and within the facilities. The controller uses CCTV systems, artificial intelligence behavioral analytics (AI) algorithms and unmanned aerial vehicles to process images and personal data. The Hyperion programme is described as an integrated entry/exit control system, with the purpose of monitoring the entry and exit of the guests and certified members NGOs through the processing of personal data, in particular biometric data.

In response to the HDPA's request for explanations of the programmes and their data processing, the controller stated that the legal basis for the Centaurus project's video surveillance was the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority pursuant to Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. It argued that prior alternative protection measures, such as fencing of the property and patrols, were not as effective as video surveillance in dealing with illegal activities. With regard to the use of drone surveillance, the controller stated that they are only used in cases of emergency, such as fire or unrest. It claimed that the retention period of Centaurus system data is 15 days unless an incident is detected, in which case it is kept for up to 1-3 months  and that access to data subjects' data is restricted to authorised police users; if copies of footage need to be provided, persons are blurred so as to minimise data. Information was provided to data subjects with notifications and warning signs on CCTV systems. Further, anti-malware software, passwords, system maintenance and software-level security policies were cited as security measures.

In the case of the Hyperion programme, the controller seems to have argued that no biometric data was not used to identify data subjects, but nonetheless citing Article 6(1)(e) GDPR as the legal basis for such processing if it does occur. Where any processing of special categories of data (namely fingerprints and biometric data) occurred for identification purposes, the controller cited Article 9(2)(b), (c), (g) and (j) GDPR as its legal basis. In a later communication, it clarified that its primary legal basis in this regard was based on substantial public interest pursuant to Article 9(2)(g) GDPR. Regarding consent, data subjects entering the accommodation facility were prompted to fill out a personal data recording form which included a consent request. Finally, the controller noted that a partial Data Protection Impact Assessment was carried out for both the Centaurus and Hyperion programmes.

The controller also claimed that there was no processing of personal data by either programme that extracted special categories of data - as a result, it found that Article 9 GDPR did not apply.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 22, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 30, Article 31, Article 35, Article 37, Article 38, Article 39, Article 55, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of personal data, including biometric data and video surveillance, by the Ministry of Migration and Asylum (the controller) through the Centaurus and Hyperion programmes, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and involves automated processing and filing systems.

2. For the Centaurus project's video surveillance, the controller relies on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR (performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority). However, the controller must demonstrate that the processing is necessary and proportionate under Article 5(1)(c) (data minimisation) and Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, transparency). The controller's claim that prior measures were ineffective does not sufficiently justify the necessity of pervasive surveillance, especially with AI behavioral analytics, which may violate the principle of data minimisation.

3. The use of drones for surveillance in ""emergencies"" lacks a clear legal basis under Article 6, as emergencies do not automatically justify processing without specific provisions in Union or Member State law, and the controller's vague description fails to meet the requirement for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes under Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation).

4. For the Hyperion programme, the controller processes biometric data, which qualifies as special category data under Article 9(1) GDPR. The controller initially denied such processing but later cited Article 9(2)(g) (substantial public interest) as the legal basis. However, the controller must have a specific legal basis under Union or Member State law that meets the requirements of Article 9(2)(g), which was not demonstrated, making the processing unlawful under Article 9.

5. The controller's attempt to obtain consent via a form for biometric processing is invalid under Article 7 and Article 9(2)(a), as consent must be freely given, specific, and informed. Given the power imbalance between asylum seekers and the authorities, consent cannot be considered freely given, as per Recital 43, and the controller failed to ensure valid consent.

6. The retention period of 15 days (extendable to 1-3 months for incidents) for Centaurus data may violate Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation), as the controller did not justify why such periods are necessary for the stated purposes, and extended retention without clear criteria risks excessive storage.

7. The security measures described (anti-malware, passwords, etc.) may be insufficient for the high-risk processing involved, especially for biometric data, under Article 32 GDPR, which requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

8. The controller conducted only a partial Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for both programmes, which is inadequate under Article 35 GDPR, as the processing involves systematic monitoring, use of new technologies, and special category data, necessitating a full DPIA to assess high risks to rights and freedoms.

9. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects as required by Articles 12-14 GDPR, particularly regarding the use of AI analytics and drones, which are not adequately covered by notifications and warning signs alone, undermining the principles of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations, including lack of lawful basis for processing special category data, invalid consent, insufficient necessity and proportionality justifications, inadequate security measures, incomplete DPIA, and failures in transparency and data minimisation."
"An investigation was carried out by the Guardia di Finanza (financial police) in which fines were imposed on four companies and databases were confiscated as they related to illegally conducted telemarketing calls from 2015 to 2022. The calls aimed at promoting services of companies in the electricity and gas sector. One of these companies was Enel Energia ('the controller').

Further investigation of the databases revealed that Enel Energia acquired as many as 978 contracts from the four companies, even though the companies did directly not belong to Enel Energia's sales network. The agreements reached by these companies with potential customers were sent to the Enel Energia’s customer relationship management ('CRM') system, which actually concluded the contracts on behalf on Enel Energia.

An additional investigation was launched by the Italian DPA ('Garante'), which revealed that these marketing activities were carried out using illicitly acquired lists of customers which contained addresses, telephone numbers, municipality of customer residences, and the customer's relevant energy company. The four companies which were never officially designated by Enel nor any of its sales agencies as data processors, nor was Enel fully aware of these irregularities. However, the processing activities were performed on Enel's behalf and with economic profit for the latter.

The DPA investigated in particular the lack of security measures in the access to the CRM system. The Garante noted how it was extremely easy for external companies - even in lack of any direct contractual relationship with Enel - to obtain the credentials necessary to use the system and ""upload"" contracts in violation of the law.

As a response to the allegations made by the Garante, Enel Energia highlighted procedural irregularities. They contested the  proceedings, among other things, by claiming that the Garante infringed the principle of ne bis in idem as the objections overlapped with previous measures against Enel. In particular, the Tribunal of Rima by ruling No. 443/2021 had already annulled the Garante’s fine against Enel Energia.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves Enel Energia as a data controller and four external companies processing personal data on its behalf, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processor', and Article 3 on territorial scope since the processing occurred in the EU context.

2. The four companies processed personal data (including addresses, telephone numbers, and energy provider details) without proper authorization from Enel Energia, violating Article 28(1) which requires controllers to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to meet GDPR requirements.

3. Enel Energia failed to establish a contractual relationship or any legal act with the four companies as required by Article 28(3), which mandates that processing by a processor must be governed by a binding contract outlining the subject-matter, duration, nature, purpose, and obligations of the processor.

4. The lack of security measures in accessing Enel's CRM system, allowing external companies to obtain credentials easily, violates Article 32(1) which requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including preventing unauthorised access to personal data.

5. Enel Energia, as the controller, did not demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2) and Article 24, as it failed to ensure and prove compliance with GDPR principles, including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), and did not implement adequate measures to secure processing activities conducted on its behalf.

6. The processing of personal data through illicitly acquired customer lists without a lawful basis (such as consent or legitimate interest) violates Article 6(1), which requires that processing be lawful, and Article 5(1)(a) on lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.

7. Although Enel claimed procedural irregularities and ne bis in idem, the GDPR violations are distinct and ongoing, as the lack of processor contracts and security measures represent separate infringements from any previous measures, as supported by Article 83(2) on administrative fines considering the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations, including failure to comply with processor obligations (Article 28), insufficient security measures (Article 32), and lack of lawful processing principles (Article 5 and 6)."
"HUBSIDE.STORE (“controller”) has stores in France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy. In France, the controller carried out canvassing campaigns by telephone and SMS from prospect files purchased from two main data brokers, in order to promote the products it sold. The French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out an inspection at the controller’s premises in order to verify compliance with the GDPR and French Data Protection Act.

During this inspection, the CNIL discovered that, regarding commercial prospecting by SMS, the controller carried out these operations using prospect files purchased from data suppliers. These data suppliers collected the data of the persons concerned via entry forms for online competitions, in order to enable their partners to use them in their commercial prospecting.

The CNIL indicated that the forms accessible on the websites of the data suppliers were similar: beneath the fields enabling the person to enter their contact details was a “VALIDATE”, “I VALIDATE” or “I ANSWER QUESTIONS TO APPLY” button. Above or below this button, a text specified that by clicking on the button, the data subject declares that they have read the controller’s privacy policy and accepts that the data collected will be used to send them offers from the company’s partners. Hyperlinks were provided to access the privacy policy and the list of partners concerned. At the end of the text, it specified that if the data subject wishes to continue without receiving offers from the controller’s partners, they can click on a link in the text (“click here”).

The CNIL also pointed out that the form contains a hypertext link to a nominative lust of partners and not to categories of partners. However, the list did not mention HUBSIDE.STORE.

The controller also provided the CNIL with recordings of canvassing calls that they sent to Belgium in order to promote its stores there. The CNIL found that during these calls, the data subjects were only informed that the call had been recorded and that they could register with Bloctel.

The CNIL issued a decision regarding the legal basis for the commercial prospecting by SMS, by telephone, concerning the information delivered to the data subjects, and finally regarding the security measures implemented by the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6, Article 14","1. The case involves HUBSIDE.STORE processing personal data for commercial prospecting via SMS and telephone calls, which falls under the GDPR's material scope as defined in Article 2(1), as it constitutes automated processing of personal data.

2. Regarding commercial prospecting by SMS: The consent mechanism used by HUBSIDE.STORE's data suppliers violates Article 4(11) and Article 7(1), as consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The forms used pre-ticked boxes or implied consent through action (clicking ""VALIDATE""), which does not constitute explicit affirmative action as required. Furthermore, Article 7(2) requires that the request for consent be clearly distinguishable from other matters, which was not adequately achieved here.

3. The information provided to data subjects was insufficient under Article 13(1)(a) and (c), as the list of partners did not include HUBSIDE.STORE specifically, preventing data subjects from being informed about the identity of the controller and the purposes of processing. This lack of transparency violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

4. For telephone canvassing calls to Belgium, the information provided during calls failed to meet Article 13(1)(c) and (2)(c) requirements, as data subjects were only informed about call recording and Bloctel registration, not about the full purposes of processing or their right to withdraw consent. This constitutes a breach of the right to be informed under Chapter III.

5. The security measures implemented by HUBSIDE.STORE were found inadequate under Article 32(1), which requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The CNIL's inspection revealed insufficient safeguards, such as lack of access controls and insecure storage of personal data, violating the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f).

6. The processing of personal data for commercial prospecting without valid consent also violates Article 6(1)(a), as the legal basis for processing was not established lawfully. Additionally, the right to object under Article 21(2) was not effectively facilitated, as the opt-out mechanism (clicking a link) was not presented in a clear and separate manner as required by Article 21(4).

7. The transfer of personal data to third countries (e.g., data brokers outside the EU) without adequate safeguards under Chapter V (Articles 44-49) may also apply, though not explicitly stated, further compounding noncompliance.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations across consent mechanisms, information obligations, security measures, and lawful processing requirements."
"A public middle school (the controller) had four cameras on its property: one in front of the school entrance, one in front of a computer space, one in front of the teacher’s lounge and management area, and one near the escape stairs. According to the controller, the purpose of the video surveillance was to protect persons from theft or attacks. The use of video cameras is signaled at the school's entrance. The controller maintained video records for 48 hours.

In response to the Austrian DPA's (DSB) investigation, the controller noted that preventing pupils from being endangered by other pupils during school is part of the duty of supervision assigned to teachers and schools. It relied on legitimate interests as a legal basis pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process personal data via the video surveillance cameras. The controller cited a DSB ruling that video surveillance of public bodies in the context of private sector activities for the purpose of self-protection or responsibility may be permissible even without express legal authorisation if carried out in response to specific dangerous situations and consistent with the principle of proportionality. As such, it argued that the use of technical surveillance measures in this context were authorised under national law (§ 1 para. 2 DSG).",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves a public middle school acting as a data controller processing personal data through video surveillance cameras, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2(1), as it constitutes processing of personal data by automated means.

2. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) as the legal basis for processing. However, video surveillance in educational settings typically involves monitoring of minors in their daily activities, which may capture special categories of data under Article 9(1) (e.g., data revealing racial origin through visual images, or health data if disabilities are visible). Article 9 prohibits processing of special categories of data unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller did not demonstrate that any such exception (such as explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or substantial public interest under Article 9(2)(g)) was satisfied.

3. The controller cited a previous DSB ruling regarding video surveillance for self-protection in private sector activities, but this case involves a public school processing data of minors, which requires heightened protection under GDPR. Article 57(1)(b) requires supervisory authorities to promote public awareness of risks, particularly concerning children. The processing of children's data requires special consideration under Article 8 and Recital 38, which the controller failed to address adequately.

4. The principle of proportionality under Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization) was violated. The placement of cameras near areas like the teachers' lounge and management area appears excessive for the stated purpose of protection against theft or attacks, as these are not typical high-risk areas for such incidents. The surveillance of escape stairs might be justified for safety, but the broad coverage suggests disproportionate processing.

5. The transparency requirements under Articles 12 and 13 were not fully met. While the controller signaled surveillance at the entrance, Article 13 requires providing detailed information to data subjects, including the legal basis, purposes, and recipients of data. The information provided was likely insufficient, especially for children who require clear and age-appropriate explanations under Article 12(1).

6. The storage period of 48 hours might comply with the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), but the overall processing fails the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller did not demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles, particularly necessity and proportionality under Article 6(1)(f), which requires balancing the controller's interests against the data subjects' rights. Given the school environment involving minors, the balance likely favors protecting the children's privacy over the school's security interests.

7. The controller referenced national law (§ 1(2) DSG), but under Article 6(3), member state laws must meet EU law requirements. The national law did not provide adequate authorization for this processing, as it conflicted with GDPR's higher standards for protecting children's data and special category data.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"On 7 December 2022, a data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD against Caixabank (the controller). The controller required new clients to sign a contract for provision of services, which included a clause stating that data subjects consent to their data being requested from the General Treasury of Social Security. For existing clients, the same clause was included in a declaration or modification contract. The provision cited Law 10/2010, a Spanish law on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, stating that it required the collection of such data. For both new and existing clients, the contract did not give an option to refuse consent – instead, consent was pre-established by the clause. 3,026,247 new clients signed the contract, and 3,401,052 existing clients signed the modification contract.

The data subject claimed that, after they expressed their disagreement, the controller stated that failure to sign the form with these clauses would result in the bank account being blocked.

On 30 January 2023, the AEPD informed the controller of the complaint. In its defense brief, the controller stated that it is required by Law 10/2010. In particular, it pointed to Article 11, which obliges financial institutions to guarantee that they are engaging with professional or business activities of the client. The controller interpreted this to mean that the identification of the client was necessary, as well as the collection of information concerning the client’s professional or business activities.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6","1. The case involves a data subject filing a complaint against Caixabank (the controller) for requiring consent to process personal data obtained from the General Treasury of Social Security as a mandatory condition for banking services, with account blocking threatened for non-compliance.

2. The controller's processing relies on consent as the legal basis under Article 6(1)(a), but the consent obtained is not freely given as required by Article 4(11) and Article 7(4), since the data subject faced detrimental consequences (account blocking) for refusing consent, creating an imbalance between the controller and data subject.

3. The controller incorrectly invokes Law 10/2010 (Spanish money laundering prevention law) as justifying the processing, but if the processing were truly necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c), it should not require consent. The controller cannot simultaneously claim legal obligation basis and obtain consent, creating a legal basis contradiction.

4. For existing clients, the processing constitutes further processing for a new purpose (money laundering checks) under Article 6(4), requiring compatibility assessment. The controller failed to provide the required information about this new purpose under Article 13(3) and did not obtain valid consent for this separate processing operation.

5. The controller violated Article 7(1) by failing to demonstrate valid consent, and Article 7(3) by making consent withdrawal impossible without penalties, as account blocking would result from refusing or withdrawing consent.

6. The processing involves collecting data about professional activities which may constitute special category data under Article 9 if it reveals trade union membership or other protected characteristics. The controller failed to identify an appropriate exception under Article 9(2) for such processing.

7. The controller violated Article 12(2) by failing to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, as they imposed punitive measures for refusing consent rather than providing proper mechanisms to exercise rights under Articles 15-22.

8. The controller failed to comply with the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) by using coercive measures to obtain consent and misrepresenting the legal basis for processing.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"On 15 March 2022, I-DE Redes Eléctricas Inteligentes, S.A.U. (the controller) detected an attack on its GEA management portal (GEA portal), which is a web portal that manages service connections between the electric distribution network. At that point, the controller had yet to detect any effect on personal data.

The following day (16 March), a brute force attack was made against the same webpage, resulting in a general slowdown. The controller adopted security measures in order to repel the attack. The controller analysed the attack’s activity and concluded that it has extracted the personal data of 1.35 million clients. The breached data included names, surnames, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, national identification card numbers and client codes. On 18 March 2022, the controller notified the breach to the AEPD.

The controller is Iberdrola's energy distribution brand. Spanish law concerning the electricity sector requires that regulated activities (such as distribution of electricity) and unregulated activities (such as marketing) be unbundled. In accordance with such law, the controller stated that it could only access the personal data of users of its electric service. It thus claims that it does not have access to the data of data subjects managed by other distribution companies.

Despite this separation, the controller communicated the breach to other companies of the Iberdrola group on 28 March 2022, noting that it could have affected information referring to clients of these companies. The controller included internal codes corresponding to the affected clients so that the companies could verify if those clients’ data had been compromised. Two companies, Iberdrola Clientes, S.A. and Curenergía Comercializador de Ultimo Recurso SA, subsequently reported to the AEPD that personal data of 92,550 and 1,515,000 clients was affected, respectively. Due to the numerous companies affected, the AEPD initiated investigations into four entities.

The controller requested that its case be joined with the AEPD’s investigation of Iberdrola (EXP202305587). It noted that the attack on its GEA portal was the common security incident that prompted both cases. With regard to the data breach and its security measures, the controller stated that had adopted the totality of security measures established by Iberdrola. It also argued that there had been no harm to the data subjects as a result of the breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a data breach affecting I-DE Redes Eléctricas Inteligentes, S.A.U. (the controller) and multiple other companies within the Iberdrola group, compromising personal data including names, surnames, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, national identification card numbers, and client codes of millions of data subjects.

2. Under Article 33(1) of the policy, the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The controller detected the attack on 15 March 2022 but only notified the AEPD on 18 March 2022, which may exceed the 72-hour window if the controller became ""aware"" of the breach on 15 March when the attack was first detected.

3. According to Article 33(3), the notification to the supervisory authority must include at minimum: the nature of the personal data breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures taken or proposed to address it. The controller initially reported only affecting its own clients (1.35 million) but failed to adequately assess and report that the breach potentially affected clients of other group companies (ultimately affecting over 1.6 million additional clients across Iberdrola Clientes, S.A. and Curenergía Comercializador de Ultimo Recurso SA), indicating an incomplete initial assessment and notification.

4. Article 32(1) requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. The successful brute force attack on the GEA portal suggests potential inadequacies in the controller's security measures, particularly regarding access controls and intrusion detection systems.

5. The controller's argument that ""there had been no harm to the data subjects"" does not negate the obligation to notify under Article 33, as notification is required unless the breach ""is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons."" The compromised data included sensitive personal identifiers (national ID numbers) which create significant risks of identity theft and fraud.

6. The controller's delayed communication to other group companies (on 28 March, 12 days after detecting the full extent of the breach) about potentially affected clients further demonstrates failure to properly assess and address the full scope of the breach in a timely manner, potentially violating the requirement to implement appropriate organisational measures under Article 32.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to failures in timely breach notification, incomplete assessment of the breach scope, and potentially inadequate security measures."
"The Hellenic Data Protection Authority undertook an investigation following numerous complaints regarding unsolicited spam calls originating from companies acting as call centres (hereinafter “processor”) on behalf of ELPEDISON A.E. (hereinafter ""controller""), aimed at promoting the controller's products and services. In Greece, individuals have the option to register under Article 11 of Greek Law 3471/2006 (hereinafter ""register-list"") to opt out of unsolicited communications. During the investigation, complaints that did not meet validity criteria (e.g., complainants not registered on the register-list or failing to raise objections under [[Article 21 GDPR|Article 21 GDPR]]) were rejected by the HDPA. The remaining 40 potentially valid complaints, two of which were still under investigation, were categorised into four categories. Category A: six complaints where the controller acknowledged a violation might had occurred. Category B: three complaints where the controller disputed the occurrence of a violation. Category C: twenty-nine complaints where the controller claimed to had fulfilled its obligation but the processor failed. Therefore, in addition to the controller, the investigation was extended to include five processors. These processors included BEFON (3 complaints), Call Experts (11 complaints), Televise (1 complaint), Zitatel (8 complaints), and Plegmanet (7 complaints). Category D: two complaints that were still under investigation at the time.

The controller had failed in many cases to provide a correct, up-to-date register-list on time, pointing out the complex process that involves receiving the register-list from various providers, which it then needs to combine and send to the processors. The processor pointed out that delays in the register-list update were due to the 11 million phone numbers that required reformatting before they could be imported and the long time required to upload them into the relevant systems. Both the controller and its processors blame human and systemic errors, claiming they were isolated incidents and not intentional.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller (ELPEDISON A.E.) and multiple processors (call centers) processing personal data for direct marketing purposes, which falls under the scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller engaged in processing operations (unsolicited marketing calls) without a valid legal basis under Article 6, as the data subjects had registered on the national opt-out list (register-list), effectively exercising their right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes under Article 21(2) and (3).

3. The controller failed to ensure that processing activities complied with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), as they processed personal data contrary to the data subjects' expressed objections through the register-list.

4. The controller violated Article 21(2) and (3), which require that data subjects' objections to direct marketing be respected immediately, and that personal data no longer be processed for such purposes once an objection is raised.

5. The controller failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2), as they could not prove that appropriate technical and organizational measures were in place to ensure and demonstrate compliance, evidenced by their inability to provide accurate, up-to-date register-lists to processors in a timely manner.

6. The controller breached their obligations under Article 24(1) by not implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure processing complies with GDPR, given the systemic issues with register-list management and distribution to processors.

7. The controller violated Article 28(1) and (3) by failing to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, and by not having a binding contract ensuring the processor respects the controller's obligations.

8. The processors failed to process personal data only on documented instructions from the controller under Article 29, as they made calls to data subjects who had registered objections on the register-list.

9. Both controller and processors failed to ensure data accuracy under Article 5(1)(d), as they maintained and used outdated register-lists containing incorrect information about data subjects' marketing preferences.

10. The claimed ""human and systemic errors"" do not constitute valid excuses under GDPR, as Article 24(1) requires controllers to implement measures adequate to ensure ongoing compliance, regardless of operational complexities.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that Jamk University of Applied Sciences (the controller) unnecessarily processed the location data of its employees. The DPA then asked the controller to explain the purpose for which it processed the location data of its employees.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it used a third-party mobile application that allowed remote employees to record their working hours. The controller explained that the use of the app also required location data to be enabled by default. The controller emphasised that it did not actively use the location data, but only processed it for system technical reasons.

The controller also stated that the use of the app was voluntary. If the employee had chosen to use the app, the processing was based on the data subject's consent. The controller noted that the use of the app was also in compliance with [https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20040759#L2P3 Section 3 of the Finnish Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life], according to which the employer may only process personal data that is directly necessary for the employee's employment relationship.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves the processing of location data of employees by Jamk University of Applied Sciences, which constitutes personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR, as it relates to identifiable natural persons.

2. The controller claims that the processing is based on consent under Article 6(1)(a), as the use of the app is voluntary. However, for consent to be valid, it must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous under Article 7(1). In the employment context, there is a power imbalance, which may undermine the freedom of consent, as indicated in the spirit of the GDPR and relevant recitals (e.g., Recital 43).

3. Article 7(4) specifies that when assessing if consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether the performance of a contract is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for that contract. Here, the app is used for recording working hours, but the requirement to enable location data by default may not be necessary for this purpose, suggesting that consent might not be freely given.

4. The controller admits that location data is not actively used but is processed for ""system technical reasons,"" which lacks specificity and does not demonstrate a legitimate purpose. This violates the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), which requires personal data to be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

5. The processing of location data when it is not actively used or necessary for the stated purpose (recording working hours) contravenes the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), which requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.

6. The app requires location data to be enabled by default, which violates Article 25(2) on data protection by default. This article mandates that by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose should be processed, and users should not be required to provide additional data unnecessarily.

7. The controller references compliance with the Finnish Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life, which allows processing only if directly necessary for employment. However, under Article 88 of the GDPR, member state laws must ensure the protection of data subjects' rights and freedoms, and the processing of location data here does not appear directly necessary, thus not justifying the processing under GDPR standards.

8. Therefore, the processing of location data is not based on valid consent, violates data minimization and purpose limitation principles, and fails to adhere to data protection by default requirements.

9. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Two controllers that offered gambling and betting activities online included cookie banners on their websites. The banners did not distinguish different purposes for processing, making a single request for consent. The controllers' privacy policies also lacked information about the legal basis for processing, the types of cookies used, the purpose of each cookie and the cookie storage periods. In addition, one of the controllers processed personal data prior to obtaining data subjects' consent.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13","1. The case involves two controllers offering online gambling and betting activities, which process personal data through cookie banners on their websites, falling under the scope of the Regulation as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'controller', 'processing', and 'personal data'.

2. The cookie banners did not distinguish different purposes for processing and made a single request for consent. This violates Article 7(2) which requires that consent requests be presented in a manner clearly distinguishable from other matters, using clear and plain language. Additionally, Article 4(11) defines consent as requiring specificity of purpose, and Article 6(1)(a) mandates that consent must be given for one or more specific purposes.

3. The privacy policies lacked information about the legal basis for processing, types of cookies used, purpose of each cookie, and storage periods. This violates Article 13(1) which requires controllers to provide information including the purposes of processing, legal basis, categories of personal data, storage periods, and existence of data subject rights at the time when personal data are obtained.

4. One controller processed personal data prior to obtaining consent. This violates Article 6(1) which states that processing is lawful only if it has a valid legal basis, such as consent under Article 6(1)(a), and processing cannot occur before obtaining such consent.

5. The combination of these violations - lack of specific consent requests, insufficient privacy information, and processing before consent - demonstrates non-compliance with multiple fundamental principles including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), and the specific consent requirements throughout the Regulation.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The Swedish DPA (""IMY"") initiated an investigation against Expressen Lifestyle AB (""the controller"") on 2019 to check whether consent was obtained in compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR.

Following the implementation of the GDPR in 2018, the controller reassessed its legal basis for processing personal data, and started relying mainly on contractual necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR instead of consent when subscribing for the controller's magazine. However, the controller accidentally missed updating the registration form of one of the company's webshop, Magasinshoppen. The webshop had a checkbox on its webpage along with the text ""I accept the subscription terms. By doing so, I consent to the processing of personal data within the Bonnier Group."" The controller also did not update the subscription terms which stated: “When ordering, you agree that your personal data, including email address, mobile phone number for calls and text messages and any other digital addresses, may be stored and used within Bonnier for digital services, marketing, and for statistical and analytical purposes."" Furthermore, information was provided on the the right to withdraw consent.

After the DPA's inspection began, the controller took immediate action to correct the information provided in their webshop's registration process. Now, instead of being presented with either a consent request or consent information text, the data subject is asked to agree to the subscription terms (i.e. the terms of purchase) and to confirm to have read the controller’s data protection policy.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 13,"1. The case involves Expressen Lifestyle AB, which is a controller processing personal data for magazine subscriptions, as defined under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, making it subject to the regulation.

2. The controller intended to rely on contractual necessity under Article 6(1)(b) or legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) for processing personal data, but in the Magasinshoppen webshop, they incorrectly relied on consent under Article 6(1)(a), as indicated by the checkbox text: ""I accept the subscription terms. By doing so, I consent to the processing of personal data within the Bonnier Group.""

3. The way consent was obtained—bundled with the acceptance of subscription terms—violates Article 7(2) of the GDPR, which requires that the request for consent be presented in a manner clearly distinguishable from other matters, using clear and plain language.

4. Conditioning the subscription on consent to processing personal data for purposes such as marketing, analytics, and digital services, which may not be necessary for the performance of the contract, means that consent was not freely given, contrary to Article 7(4) of the GDPR.

5. The consent was not specific or informed as required by Article 4(11) and Article 7(1) of the GDPR, because the subscription terms broadly mentioned processing for various purposes without clearly separating the consent for each specific purpose.

6. Since the legal basis for processing was invalid due to improper consent, the processing was unlawful under Article 6(1) of the GDPR.

7. Although the controller corrected the process after the DPA's inspection, the noncompliance occurred prior to that correction, during the period when invalid consent was used.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 2 November 2022, a security breach occurred on Shanghai Moonton Technology Co. Ltd.’s (the controller) videogame forum. The controller is a Chinese videogame company headquartered in Shanghai that was acquired by Bytedance in March 2021.

The breach affected 442 Spanish data subjects and included usernames on the controller’s forum, user ID numbers, frequency of each data subject’s visit to the forum, the reported sex of data subjects, IP addresses, email addresses and the data subjects’ activities on the forum including publications and interactions. On the day of the breach, 2 November 2022, the personal data obtained in the breach was published on a third party website. The following day, 3 November 2022, a member of the controller’s security team identified the publication of the data on the third party website. From 4 November to 16 November 2022, the controller investigated the data breach. The controller identified the location of each data subject based on their IP address and notified the corresponding DPAs accordingly. It began notifying DPAs on 11 November 2022.

On 21 November 2022, the controller notified the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of thebreach.

In its investigation, the AEPD noted that the controller used moderators which were volunteers, not employees or contractors, in order to manage its forums. Moderators were hired using a two-week trial period and were required to abide by terms of service and a code of conduct. The controller gave moderators access to users’ personal data in order to monitor the forums and where necessary, revise or eliminate posts, block user access to the forum, respond to users or approve new users. This access included data which was available to all users on the forum including data subjects’ usernames, user IDs, number of visits to the forum, reported sex, and activities on the forum. In addition, moderators were given access to personal data which was not already publicly available to all forum users: data subjects’ email addresses, time and date of the most recent activity on the forum, and IP addresses.

The controller stated that it had security measures in place prior to the breach with regard to the affected data with the goal of avoiding such incidents. It was unaware of any prior security incidents and noted that it had not received any claim or request from data subjects in Spain in relation to the breach. With regard to the delay in notifying the AEPD of the breach, the controller argued that as it did not have a legal establishment in Spain, it needed to contract a legal assessor within Spain to prepare the due notification and documents.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 27, Article 32, Article 33","1. The controller, Shanghai Moonton Technology Co. Ltd., experienced a personal data breach on 2 November 2022, which was discovered on 3 November 2022, but the Spanish DPA (AEPD) was not notified until 21 November 2022. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The 18-day delay (from discovery on 3 November to notification on 21 November) exceeds the 72-hour requirement and is not justified as undue delay, violating Article 33(1).

2. The controller argued that the delay was due to needing to contract a legal assessor in Spain to prepare the notification. However, Article 27 requires controllers not established in the Union to designate in writing a representative in the Union. The controller's need to find a local representative after the breach occurred indicates a failure to comply with the pre-existing obligation under Article 27, exacerbating the violation of Article 33(1).

3. The breach involved personal data including usernames, user IDs, IP addresses, email addresses, and forum activities. Article 4(1) defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, and IP addresses are explicitly included as online identifiers. The compromised data constitutes personal data under the Regulation.

4. The breach resulted in the publication of personal data on a third-party website, which likely poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Article 34(1) requires controllers to communicate a personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk. The controller did not notify the data subjects, as noted in the case (""it had not received any claim or request from data subjects in Spain""), indicating a potential violation of Article 34(1), as the breach involved sensitive information like email addresses and IP addresses that could lead to phishing, identity theft, or other harms.

5. The controller used volunteer moderators who were given access to non-public personal data, including email addresses and IP addresses. Articles 28 and 29 require that processing by a processor (including any person acting under the authority of the controller) be governed by a contract or legal act and that such persons do not process data except on instructions from the controller. The use of volunteers without formal contracts or binding obligations may violate the requirements for processors under Articles 28 and 29, as there is no evidence of sufficient guarantees or adherence to documented instructions.

6. The controller's security measures were insufficient to prevent the breach, as required by Article 32, which mandates appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The breach itself and the access granted to volunteers indicate potential failures in implementing adequate security measures, violating Article 32.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 33(1) (notification delay to supervisory authority), Article 27 (lack of designated representative), Article 34(1) (failure to notify data subjects), and Articles 28/29 (inadequate processor controls)."
"On the night of 31 July 2021, a cyber-attack occurred in the healthcare system of the Lazio region, Italy. It had some serious repercussions causing local health authorities, hospitals and nursing homes ('the controllers') being unable to use regional information systems for hours and in some cases even for months. Essential services related to the emergency activities were not interrupted as they were separeted from other applications.

The ransomware attack originated in March 2021 on a computer of a regional employee working remotely for one of the entities. The employee installed a malicious software necessary to connect to the processor’s network. The software created a backdoor to the system stealing the employee’s access credentials.

LAZIOcrea S.p.a. was a company responsible for the management and security of the information systems of Lazio Region pursuant to Article 28 GDPR (‘processor’ or ‘company’). The attack targeted machines located in one of the rooms of the data center managed by the company. The company was therefore also acting as a controller for its own purposes, as the operating systems which were attacked also managed additional processing activities.

The company did not notify the data breach immediately but with considerable delay and in any case beyond 72 hours as required by Article 33 GDPR. The data breach was notified to the affected controllers about two weeks after the incident, lacking specific references to the attacked processing systems which would have been beneficial for each controller to delineate the extent of the breach and evaluate associated risks.

The notification of the data breach itself did not document necessary information about the attack such as, i.e. date and time of closure of the incident, date and time of resolution of the incident, person who detected the incident. Moreover, some of the information provided was inaccurate, i.e. description of the incident, the response actions carried out.

Due to this, the Italian DPA (‘Garante’) had to act ex officio following press reports regarding the facts in question and notifications presented by various data controllers involved. The investigation revealed that the company did not adopt several security measures.

Firstly, at the time of the incident, the company did not have staff dedicated to a 24-hour analysis of the alerts generated by Microsoft’s SIEM, the security monitoring system. Secondly, the company did not separate the networks for employee’s accounts and servers used for various processing operations carried out. Thirdly, although the filtering rules on the firewalls in the data center managed by the company were set up to target specific critical systems, they failed to stop the malware from spreading to around 180 systems. Fourthly, the attackers succeeded due to a vulnerable authentication procedure for remote system access, relying solely on username and password credentials and the company’s failure to update its operating system creating additional vulnerabilities.

It also emerged that the temporary unavailability of access to data processed through the mentioned healthcare facilities was, on the one hand, a direct consequence of the cyber-attack and, on the other hand, an indirect consequence of the subsequent actions by the company. In fact, the company decided to shut down all the server systems which disabled them from determining which ones were compromised. Additionally, given the absence of the system separation, it could not prevent further spread of the malware.

As part of its defence, the company represented that it performed annual internal audits based on the certification process of the Information Security Management System. The company also declared that prior to the accident, the system information security was implemented in compliance with the industry standards certification ISO/IEC 27001.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 33, Article 42","1. The case involves a ransomware attack affecting healthcare data processors and controllers in the Lazio region, with LAZIOcrea S.p.a. acting as both processor (under Article 28 GDPR) and controller for certain processing activities, making it subject to GDPR obligations.

2. The processor failed to notify the data breach to the affected controllers without undue delay, as it provided notification about two weeks after the incident. This violates Article 33(1) GDPR, which requires notification to the supervisory authority within 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach.

3. The breach notification lacked specific references to the attacked processing systems and contained inaccurate information (e.g., description of the incident, response actions). This violates Article 33(3) GDPR, which mandates that the notification include at least the nature of the breach, categories of data subjects affected, likely consequences, and measures taken.

4. The processor failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) GDPR. Specifically:
   - No 24-hour monitoring of security alerts (violating Article 32(1)(b) on ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of processing systems).
   - Failure to separate networks for employee accounts and servers (violating Article 32(1)(d) on implementing processes for regularly testing security measures).
   - Inadequate firewall rules that failed to prevent malware spread (violating Article 32(1)(a) on pseudonymisation and encryption measures).
   - Use of vulnerable authentication procedures (solely username/password) and failure to update operating systems (violating Article 32(1)(a) and (d)).

5. The processor's actions (shutting down all server systems without proper separation) exacerbated the unavailability of data, violating Article 32(2) GDPR, which requires ensuring that natural persons acting under the authority of the controller or processor do not process data except on instructions.

6. The processor's defense regarding ISO/IEC 27001 certification and internal audits is insufficient under Article 32(4) GDPR, as adherence to approved certification mechanisms may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance but does not absolve the controller/processor if actual measures are inadequate.

7. As a processor, LAZIOcrea S.p.a. failed to assist the controllers in ensuring compliance with security obligations under Article 28(3)(f) GDPR and did not notify the controllers immediately after becoming aware of the breach, as required by Article 33(2) GDPR.

8. The cumulative failures in breach notification, security measures, and processor obligations demonstrate noncompliance with multiple GDPR provisions, including Articles 28, 32, and 33.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Central Young Men’s Christian Association (the controller) offers a Positive Health Programme (Programme), which is an exercise scheme for people living with HIV. As part of the Programme, the Central YMCA collects special categories of data including referrals, dates of HIV diagnosis, medications taken, medical statistics, referring hospitals or clinicians and other medical history.

On 6 October 2022, a coordinator of the Programme sent an email to a mailing list of 270 recipients. The recipients were entered into the carbon copy (CC) function rather than the blind carbon copy (BCC) function, revealing the email addresses of all 270 recipients. The controller became aware of the breach the following day upon receiving complaints from affected data subjects. Upon realising the error, the coordinator attempted to unsend the email, but unintentionally sent a second email to all 270 recipients with the email addresses again entered in the CC function. Accounting for duplicates, 264 email addresses were disclosed in the breach, of which 115 had clear names and 51 had partial names that made them potentially identifiable. Thus, 166 data subjects were affected by the breach.

The controller reported the breach to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on 7 October 2022. On 10 October 2022, the controller notified the affected data subjects, took accountability of its error and informed data subjects of the steps it was taking.

At the time of the breach, the controller had a verbally communicated policy that the Programme staff should send event invitations using the BCC function. The controller had access to an email marketing tool which would permit for the sending of individual emails to each recipient, but it did not use this tool in sending emails relating to the Programme.

The controller waived its opportunity to respond to the ICO’s Notice of Intent and instead accepted the Notice and the ICO’s findings. It took remedial steps, conducting an audit of how external communications were being undertaken across the organisation and issuing new procedures to provide appropriate guidance on sending secure emails. The controller also updated its data protection training.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves the processing of special categories of personal data (including HIV status, medical history, and medications) by the Central YMCA, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited under Article 9(1) unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. While the controller may have had a lawful basis for processing under Article 9(2)(h) (healthcare purposes) or Article 9(2)(a) (explicit consent), the breach demonstrates inadequate safeguards for such sensitive data.

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, they:
   - Relied on a verbally communicated policy rather than documented procedures
   - Failed to use available technical solutions (email marketing tool) that could prevent mass disclosure
   - Allowed staff to use CC instead of BCC for sensitive communications

4. The controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised disclosure.

5. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the principle of accountability under Article 5(2), as they did not have proper documented policies, procedures, or training in place to prevent such breaches.

6. While the controller reported the breach to the supervisory authority within 72 hours as required by Article 33(1) and notified data subjects as required by Article 34(1), these actions were reactive and do not compensate for the lack of preventive measures required by Articles 24, 25, and 32.

7. The repeated nature of the breach (the coordinator made the same error twice) indicates insufficient staff training and organisational measures, violating Article 24(1) and Article 32(4) regarding regular testing and evaluation of security measures.

8. The case involves a personal data breach affecting 166 data subjects, with special category data being disclosed to unauthorized recipients, constituting a serious violation of the GDPR's security requirements.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Italian Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) sent a notice to the DPA regarding possible existence of administrative violations related to Sigma s.r.l., a company which operates two Vodafone Italia S.p.A. sale points in northern Italy (‘Sigma or ‘controller’). The Financial Police carried out an investigation following a complaint by a customer of Vodafone who claimed that Sigma charged them on their credit card relating to an activation of a new contract for telephone services. The contract was concluded in the name of her deceased husband.

The investigation revealed that Sigma activated approximately 1,300 SIM cards, numerous telephone services under Vodafone brand and linked telephones to active users without their knowledge while they were made available for sale at the shop. Specifically, the company activated unsolicited services by inducing customers to sign, via a tablet, without clarifying the consequences of such consents. The company sold mobile phones without any request made by the customers that learned of the purchase by finding additional charges on their invoice. These services or devices were never delivered to the customers. Additionally, it emerged that Sigma used data of hundreds of users extracted from the Vodafone information systems.

Vodafone clarified that its relationship with Sigma is governed by a franchising contract according to which Sigma is a dealer acting as an autonomous controller of personal data related to SIM card and telephone service activations. Employees of Sigma were authorized to identify all customers and make a copy of their IDs in case of activation of a new product. Additionally, the data entry and activation of services was carried out by the employees through a computer connected to the Vodafone systems.

Consequently, circumventing the telephone operator’s controls and relevant processing provision amounted to a turnover of more than €80,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25","1. The case involves Sigma s.r.l., a Vodafone franchisee, processing personal data of customers without their knowledge or valid consent, which violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 6(1) of the GDPR, as processing requires a lawful basis such as consent, and the customers were unaware or misled about the processing.

2. Sigma induced customers to sign consents via tablet without clarifying the consequences, which fails to meet the requirements for valid consent under Article 4(11) and Article 7, as consent must be informed, specific, and unambiguous, and the data subject must be aware of the processing purposes.

3. The activation of SIM cards and telephone services without delivering them to customers, and charging them without authorization, constitutes processing for purposes that are not transparent or fair, violating the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

4. Sigma used data of hundreds of users extracted from Vodafone's systems without a lawful basis, which breaches Article 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation) and Article 6, as the data was not collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

5. The processing involved copying customers' IDs without proper justification, which could involve special categories of data if IDs reveal information like racial origin or religious beliefs, potentially violating Article 9 if processed without an exception.

6. As a controller, Sigma failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, as required by Article 24 and Article 5(2) (accountability principle).

7. The franchising contract designated Sigma as an autonomous controller, but its actions, such as bypassing Vodafone's controls, indicate a failure to adhere to data protection by design and by default under Article 25, leading to unauthorized processing.

8. The Financial Police investigation revealed a turnover of over €80,000 from these activities, highlighting the severity and scale of the violations, which could entail significant harm to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

9. The case demonstrates multiple infringements, including lack of lawful basis, invalid consent, non-transparent processing, and failure to implement security measures, which collectively constitute a serious breach of GDPR provisions.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 10 August 2022, a data subject notified 4Finance Spain Financial Services, S.A.U. (the controller) that they had received an unsolicited loan to their bank account with the controller. By 1 September 2022, the controller had received 10 more complaints of a similar nature from clients. The controller assessed the risk levels and severity of these breaches in August, September and November of the same year using an internal method based on European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) standards. Based on these assessments, the controller determined that it was not necessary to notify the violation to the AEPD or to affected parties.

Between 3 and 23 February 2023, the AEPD received various complaints from data subjects, who were clients of the controller, alleging similar unsolicited loans to their accounts. On 14 February 2023, the controller claimed to become aware of a data breach affecting personal data of its clients and employees. The breach ultimately affected 9636 data subjects and included names, birth dates, national identification numbers, foreigner identity numbers, passport or identification document numbers, payment data (such as banks and cards) and contact information.

The breach was a brute force attack that attempted different combinations of national identity numbers and emails with passwords. Once the attackers gained access to client accounts, they took out loans in the data subjects’ names, which the controller accepted and placed into client accounts. The hackers then contacted data subjects via WhatsApp, pretending to be the controller and requesting the refund of the amount to an account number controlled by the attackers. 139 of the affected data subjects were victims of this fraud.

The controller notified the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of the data breach on 17 February 2023. It expressed that it did not consider the breach to pose a high risk to the rights and liberties of affected data subjects and that it thus would not communicate the breach to them directly.

On 11 April 2023, the AEPD initiated an investigation against the controller and ordered the controller to communicate the breach to data subjects, which the controller did on the same day.

In response to the breach, the controller registered the breach in the register of incidents, filed a police report, circulated a communication to clients noting that it did not communicate with clients via Whatsapp, reset certain user passwords and amended its password policy to require more complexity and implemented two-factor authentication.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The controller (4Finance Spain Financial Services, S.A.U.) became aware of multiple unsolicited loan incidents affecting data subjects between August 2022 and February 2023, with 10 similar complaints received by 1 September 2022, indicating a pattern of personal data breaches under Article 4(12) as ""a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data"".

2. Under Article 33(1), the controller was required to notify the supervisory authority (AEPD) of the personal data breach ""without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it"". The controller's awareness of similar incidents from August 2022 onward, with confirmed breach awareness by 14 February 2023, but only notifying on 17 February 2023, constitutes an undue delay in violation of this requirement.

3. The controller's internal risk assessments (August/September/November 2022) determined notification was unnecessary, but the breach ultimately affected 9,636 data subjects with compromised sensitive data including national identification numbers, financial information, and contact details, creating risks of identity theft and financial fraud. This assessment failed to properly evaluate the high risk severity under Article 33(1)'s ""risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons"" standard.

4. Under Article 34(1), the controller was required to communicate the breach to data subjects ""without undue delay"" when it ""is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons"". The controller's failure to communicate the breach until ordered by the AEPD on 11 April 2023 violated this obligation, particularly given the sensitive nature of the compromised data and the actual financial harm suffered by 139 data subjects.

5. The breach involved inadequate security measures against brute force attacks, potentially violating Article 32's requirement to implement ""appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk"", including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data.

6. The controller's post-breach measures (password resets, two-factor implementation) while appropriate, were implemented only after regulatory intervention and did not remedy the prior violations of Articles 33 and 34 regarding timely notification.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"Seven hotels, catering services and shops used video surveillance without marking the area under surveillance in a manner that was visible when entering the recording perimeter.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 27","1. The case involves seven hotels, catering services, and shops using video surveillance systems, which process personal data as defined in Article 4(1) and (2) of the GDPR, as video footage can identify natural persons.

2. Article 5(1)(a) requires personal data to be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. The absence of visible markings indicating surveillance areas violates the transparency principle, as data subjects are not made aware of the processing when entering the recording perimeter.

3. Article 13 mandates that when personal data is collected directly from the data subject (as with video surveillance), the controller must provide specific information including the identity of the controller and the purposes of processing. The lack of visible signage prevents this information from being provided ""at the time when personal data are obtained,"" violating Article 13(1).

4. Article 12(1) requires controllers to take appropriate measures to provide information relating to processing ""in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language."" The absence of visible surveillance markings fails to meet this requirement for transparent communication.

5. The processing operation lacks a lawful basis under Article 6, as any potential legitimate interests (e.g., security) are undermined by the covert nature of the surveillance, which fails the fairness test and transparency requirements.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of the transparency principle (Article 5(1)(a)), information obligations (Articles 12 and 13), and lawful processing requirements (Article 6)."
"On 22 April 2024, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) initiated sanctioning procedures against Watium S.L. (the controller). As part of its investigation, the AEPD twice requested the controller to provide information related to the complaint filed against it. The requests were received by the controller on 23 November 2023 and 9 February 2024 respectively.

On 21 February 2024, the controller requested that the period for providing the documents and information be extended to 29 February 2024. Despite this request, the controller did not respond to the AEPD with the requested information.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 58,"1. The case involves the Spanish Data Protection Authority (AEPD), which qualifies as a supervisory authority under Article 51 of the GDPR, initiating sanctioning procedures against Watium S.L., a controller as defined in Article 4.

2. As part of its investigation, the AEPD exercised its investigative powers under Article 58(1)(a), which grants supervisory authorities the power ""to order the controller and the processor... to provide any information it requires for the performance of its tasks.""

3. The controller, Watium S.L., received two information requests from the AEPD on 23 November 2023 and 9 February 2024, respectively.

4. Article 31 of the GDPR states that ""The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.""

5. On 21 February 2024, the controller requested an extension until 29 February 2024 to provide the requested information. Despite this request and the granted extension, the controller failed to provide any of the requested information to the AEPD.

6. The controller's failure to respond to the lawful information requests from the supervisory authority constitutes a clear violation of its obligation to cooperate under Article 31.

7. Furthermore, this failure to provide requested information impedes the supervisory authority's ability to perform its tasks of monitoring and enforcing the application of the Regulation, as outlined in Article 57(1)(a).

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The Rome Chamber of Commerce (‘the Chamber’ or ‘controller’) notified the DPA that it was a victim of a cyber-attack. The attack resulted in the manipulation of their application’s database of users. The purpose was to load malicious files which then enabled remote access to the system. The controller learned about the attack through the publication of an anonymous tweet mentioning the Chamber and denouncing the attack on its website.

Subsequently, Innova Camara - the processor in charge of the management of the Chamber’s website - was informed of a link to a CSV file from where it was possible to download a list of 22,300 users. The personal data affected included names, surname, tax codes, e-mail address, landline or telephone numbers, and access and identification data.

The DPA’s investigation of the notified personal data breach revealed several vulnerabilities in the processor’s security measures.

Firstly, the concerned personal data was not found on the institutional website but in a database consisting of a backup copy of the appointment management system instead. The backup was created during a system upgrade. However, it was not delete after the period necessary to verify the functioning of the system. The controller acknowledged that this copy was supposed to be deleted earlier as the work on the system update was nearing completion. However, due to the health emergency at that time, the controller had to reschedule all priorities in order to render services to users.

Secondly, the passwords of users registered in the appointment management system were stored in a file which was the object of the cyber-attack. The file was protected by the MD5 encryption algorithm which, according to the DPA, is not cryptographically robust.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves the Rome Chamber of Commerce as a controller and Innova Camara as a processor, both subject to GDPR regulations as they process personal data of EU data subjects (Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processor').

2. The controller stored personal data (including sensitive information like tax codes and access credentials) in a backup database that was not deleted after fulfilling its purpose, violating the storage limitation principle requiring personal data to be kept no longer than necessary (Article 5(1)(e)).

3. The passwords were encrypted using MD5 algorithm, which the DPA deemed not cryptographically robust, failing to implement appropriate technical measures to ensure security of processing as required by Article 32(1)(a), which mandates pseudonymisation and encryption meeting modern security standards.

4. The controller failed to ensure the processor implemented sufficient security measures, as the backup copy remained accessible and the weak encryption allowed successful cyber-attack, violating Article 28(1) requiring controllers to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees.

5. The vulnerabilities exposed 22,300 users' personal data to unauthorized access, breaching the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f) requiring protection against unauthorized processing.

6. The controller's justification about rescheduling priorities due to health emergency does not exempt them from implementing basic security measures under Article 24(1), which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical measures considering the nature, scope, and purposes of processing.

7. The processor's failure to implement robust encryption and proper data retention practices violates Article 32(2), which requires processors to implement measures ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and resilience of processing systems.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"A data subject submitted a deletion request against a controller. The controller confirmed receipt and fulfillment of the request. However, the data subject continued to receive unsolicited marketing via SMS messages from the controller. Consequently, the data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, which opened an investigation of the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17, Article 21","1. The data subject submitted a deletion request to the controller, exercising their right to erasure under Article 17 of the policy, which grants data subjects the right to obtain erasure of personal data under certain conditions, such as when the data is no longer necessary or consent is withdrawn.

2. The controller confirmed receipt and fulfillment of the request, as required under Article 12(3), which mandates that the controller provide information on action taken without undue delay.

3. However, the data subject continued to receive unsolicited marketing SMS messages from the controller, indicating that the personal data was still being processed for direct marketing purposes.

4. This continuation of processing violates Article 17(1), which requires the controller to erase personal data without undue delay upon valid request, and Article 21(3), which explicitly states that if a data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.

5. The controller's failure to cease processing for direct marketing also contravenes the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing without consent or after objection is unlawful.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller did not display the name and identity of the controller responsible for processing the personal data on its website. Cookies, which were not technically necessary for the functioning of the website, were also installed on the data subjects’ device before they could give consent.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 13,"1. The case involves a controller processing personal data through its website, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. Article 13(1)(a) requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide the data subject with the identity and contact details of the controller. The controller's failure to display its name and identity on the website violates this requirement.

3. Additionally, the installation of cookies that are not technically necessary for the website's functioning before obtaining consent contravenes Article 4(11), which defines consent as requiring a clear affirmative action, and Article 7(1), which mandates that the controller must be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing.

4. The pre-installation of non-essential cookies without prior consent also violates the principle of lawfulness of processing under Article 6(1)(a), which requires that processing be based on consent, and the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as it does not allow data subjects to make an informed decision before processing occurs.

5. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"On 19 January 2024, the DPA carried out an inspection on the website grosauto.lv, which is operated by SIA GZ AUTO (‘controller’), a company that provided car services. Once the website was visited, a cookie banner appeared with the following text: ‘This website uses cookies to optimize its performance. By continuing to use this website, you agree to the use of cookies. Read more.’ Thus, it appears that visitors are not able to provide consent other way than just continuing to use the website.

When the DPA visited the controller’s e-shop they were taken to another website called detalas.lv. At the bottom of the page a cookie banner appeared with a similar text as on the previous website saying: ‘We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website. By continuing to use this website or by staying on the page, you agree to our use of Cookies. Continue.’ Once they clicked on the ‘Use of cookies’ they were provided with information that the website collected analytical cookies and indicated that as a visitor they could turn off cookies based on the browser they were using. By clicking on ‘Continue’, the banner window disappeared.

Additionally, the website contained a ‘Privacy Policy’ which specified the possibility to withdraw consent in cases where customers’ personal data are processed by SIA GZ AUTO on the basis of customer’s consent.

However, it emerged that the controller used analytical ‘_ga’ cookies (used by Google), marketing ‘_fbp’ cookies (used by Facebook) and necessary cookies from the moment the website was opened – before the consent was provided",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7","1. The case involves a controller (SIA GZ AUTO) processing personal data through cookies on their website grosauto.lv and redirecting to detalas.lv, which falls under the GDPR's material scope as automated processing of personal data (Article 2).

2. The cookie banners on both websites only provide an option to accept cookies by continuing to use the site or staying on the page, with no mechanism to refuse consent or manage preferences before acceptance. This violates Article 7(4) which states that consent should not be bundled with acceptance of terms, and Article 4(11) which requires consent to be a clear affirmative action.

3. The controller sets analytical (_ga) and marketing (_fbp) cookies before obtaining valid consent, as they are activated upon website access prior to any user action. This violates Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness principle) and Article 6(1)(a) which requires consent before processing.

4. The privacy policy mentions the possibility to withdraw consent but provides no practical mechanism to do so for cookie consent, violating Article 7(3) which requires that withdrawal should be as easy as giving consent.

5. The use of marketing cookies without proper consent violates Article 9(1) regarding processing of special category data if inferred from browsing behavior, and requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a).

6. The controller failed to implement data protection by design and by default (Article 25) by not providing cookie preferences before processing and not limiting processing to necessary cookies only by default.

7. The controller did not maintain proper records of processing activities for cookie data (Article 30), as evidenced by the lack of control over the consent mechanism.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to invalid consent mechanism, premature processing of data, lack of withdrawal mechanism, and failure to implement data protection by design and default."
"On 28 February 2024, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) shared information concerning two new products that Meta (the controller) planned to launch for Facebook and Instagram between 30 May and 9 June 2024. The tools were Election Day Information (EDI) and Voter Information Unit (VIU), both of which would send notifications to all eligible Instagram and Facebook users in the EU to remind them to vote in EU Parliament elections. The functionalities required users to input personal data including their name, IP address, age and gender.

The controller claimed that the products aimed to ensure that all Facebook and Instagram users who are eligible to vote see the EDI and VIU features. It argued that its legal basis for processing was the necessity of executing its contract with users.

On 22 April 2024, the AEPD sent the DPC a questionnaire concerning the controller’s planned processing. It also inquired whether it had initiated its own proceedings or if it had analysed whether the processing conformed to the GDPR. The DPC responded to the questionnaire but did not respond to the AEPD’s inquiries about its own proceedings or analysis of the processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 66","1. The case involves Meta as a controller planning to process personal data (name, IP address, age, gender) through its Election Day Information (EDI) and Voter Information Unit (VIU) products for Facebook and Instagram users in the EU, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1).

2. Meta claims its legal basis for processing is ""necessity of executing its contract with users"" under Article 6(1)(b). However, sending voting reminders is not necessary for the performance of a social media service contract, as the core functionality of Facebook/Instagram involves social networking and content sharing rather than electoral participation facilitation. This violates the purpose limitation principle in Article 5(1)(b), which requires that processing be limited to specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

3. The processing involves special categories of data potentially revealing political opinions (through voting-related nudges) without meeting any exceptions under Article 9(2), particularly since Meta did not obtain explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or demonstrate processing necessity for reasons of substantial public interest under Article 9(2)(g).

4. The Irish DPC (lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1)) failed to respond to the AEPD's inquiries about its analysis of the processing's compliance, potentially violating the cooperation obligation between supervisory authorities under Article 61(1) and the consistency mechanism requirements under Article 63.

5. The planned processing likely requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(1) due to its large-scale nature and potential impact on electoral participation, but there is no evidence this was conducted or shared with concerned supervisory authorities as required by Article 36(3).

6. The controller's approach of requiring users to accept this processing as part of their contract may constitute ""bundling"" of consent, which violates Article 7(4) stating that consent cannot be freely given if performance of a contract is conditional on consent to unnecessary processing.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(b) (purpose limitation), 6(1)(b) (invalid legal basis), 9 (special category processing), 7(4) (conditional consent), and failure to follow proper supervisory cooperation procedures under Articles 61 and 63."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the City of Helsinki (the controller) had not concluded a data processing agreement with the company that maintained an online pupil welfare service that allowed pupils to contact a school counsellor or school psychologist. The DPA then asked the controller to explain who was responsible for maintaining the service.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it had no contractual documentation with the company maintaining the service regarding roles or data protection. The controller also stated that it no longer used the company to operate the service and that the service was now maintained by the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 58","1. The case involves the City of Helsinki as a controller processing personal data of pupils through an online welfare service, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing of personal data by automated means.

2. The company maintaining the online service acted as a processor under Article 4(8) of the GDPR, which defines a processor as an entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

3. Article 28(3) of the GDPR requires that processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or other legal act that sets out the subject-matter, duration, nature, purpose, type of personal data, categories of data subjects, and the obligations and rights of the controller.

4. The controller admitted that there was no contractual documentation with the company regarding roles or data protection, indicating that no such contract was in place when the company was maintaining the service.

5. This absence of a data processing agreement violates Article 28(3) of the GDPR, as the processing was not governed by the required contractual terms.

6. Additionally, Article 28(1) requires controllers to use only processors that provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, and the lack of a contract means the controller could not ensure or demonstrate such guarantees.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that through the search function of an online service operated by the City of Helsinki (the controller), it was possible to see the names of all persons registered with the service. The DPA then asked the controller to explain how it had implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the service in question was a participatory budgeting platform where city residents could discuss the development of the city and suggest things they would like to see in their own residential area. Following the DPA's request, the controller had discovered a data breach in relation to the platform.

The controller stated that the user profiles of all 124,000 people registered on the platform had been publicly searchable and viewable by default through the platform's own search function. The profiles had also been viewable through Google Search and had displayed at least the first and last name of the users.

The controller also noted that all profiles had been deleted and the possibility to register on the service had been closed. In addition, the controller had disabled the search function of the service and requested Google to remove the search results from Google Search.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves the City of Helsinki as a data controller processing personal data through its participatory budgeting platform, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), since the user profiles of all 124,000 registered persons were publicly searchable and viewable by default through the platform's search function and Google Search, exposing personal data (first and last names) without adequate safeguards.

3. The controller violated the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25(1) and (2), as the default settings made personal data accessible without individual intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons, contrary to the requirement that by default only necessary personal data should be processed and made accessible.

4. The processing likely lacked a lawful basis under Article 6(1) for making personal data publicly accessible, as consent (if obtained) would not have been informed for this specific purpose, and no other legitimate basis appears applicable for such widespread disclosure of personal data.

5. The controller failed to comply with the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c), as making full user profiles publicly accessible was not necessary for the purposes of the participatory budgeting platform.

6. The incident constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it involved the unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and the controller failed to implement measures to prevent such breach as required by Article 32.

7. The accessibility of personal data through Google Search may have involved transfers of personal data to third countries without appropriate safeguards under Chapter V of the GDPR, particularly Articles 44-49, given Google's international operations and potential data processing outside the EU/EEA.

8. The controller's actions only after the DPA's intervention (deleting profiles, disabling search function, requesting removal from Google) demonstrate that appropriate measures were not implemented proactively, as required by the GDPR.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 17 June 2021, the City of Copenhagen (“the controller”) reported a personal data breach to the Danish DPA (“Datatilsnynet”).

During a routine scan on 15 June 2021 of the controller’s open file drive, the controller found that there was access to a normally closed drive that contained personal data. The data included name and address information, but the files also contained information about well-being, language assessment and information about children's dental and health care. Normally, only four data warehouse developers have access to this data, but now approximately 37,500 employees in the municipality gained unauthorised access to information about up to 3.7 million people. This was due to human error as an employee with administrator access mistakenly gave too wide access to the drive during a disk swap.

The unauthorised access existed for almost two months until the controller discovered the error. The access was then closed and reported to the DPA. The controller stated there was a very low probability of an ordinary employee encountering the drive, as it required special prerequisites to find it. Network registration was turned off on the individual PCs, which meant that employees could not find the drive through ordinary searches on the PC. It also meant that the URL had to be known or the drive had to be actively scanned for. Moreover, the controller, after investigation, found that no scanning tool had been used to look for open drives during the period of the breach.

Furthermore, examination of the administrative log showed access only for people with a work-related need. However, the controller's logs of all administrative IT users' potential access to the drive only went back in time 35 days and therefore the controller could not definitively conclude that no employees other than those with a work-related need had accessed the data during the period.

The controller also stated that the majority of the files were not immediately readable for those who gained unauthorised access as this required a specific program to process the data. The controller argued that the data was thus not readable for a random administrative employee.

The controller stated that they would implement stronger safeguards to ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented to reduce the risk of future breaches and to ensure that potential breaches are detected quickly.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 32","1. The case involves the City of Copenhagen as a data controller processing personal data, including sensitive categories such as health information, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 4 (definitions of 'personal data' and 'processing') and Article 9 (processing of special categories of personal data).

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). The unauthorised access occurred due to human error during a disk swap, where an administrator mistakenly granted broad access to approximately 37,500 employees, exposing data of up to 3.7 million people. This indicates insufficient access control mechanisms and procedures to prevent such errors.

3. The breach persisted for almost two months before detection, demonstrating a failure in the controller's ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services, as mandated by Article 32(1)(b). The delayed detection suggests inadequate monitoring or regular testing of security measures.

4. The controller's argument that the data was not easily accessible or readable does not negate the violation. Article 5(1)(f) requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised access. The mere possibility of access by unauthorised personnel constitutes a breach of this principle.

5. The controller's logs only retained data for 35 days, preventing a full assessment of who accessed the data during the breach period. This violates Article 32(2), which requires the controller and processor to take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under their authority who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, and Article 24, which requires the controller to implement measures to demonstrate compliance.

6. The processing of special categories of data (e.g., health information) without appropriate safeguards violates Article 9(1), which prohibits such processing unless conditions like Article 9(2)(h) (health purposes) are met. The broad unauthorised access means the processing was not carried out with necessary safeguards, such as strict access controls.

7. The controller's response to implement stronger safeguards after the breach does not rectify the prior noncompliance but highlights the initial insufficiency of measures, further underscoring the violation of Article 32.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to failures in security measures, access controls, breach detection, and accountability, violating Articles 5(1)(f), 9, 24, and 32."
"On 20 May 2023, the DPA carried out an on-site investigation into the operations of a company called AQAPHOTO (‘controller’), carried out the at the Līvu Akvaparks, a water amusement park. The controller’s primary activity was offering photography services to visitors (‘data subjects’) at the amusement park. For the purpose to capture and provide photographic memories, the controller hired photographers which took photos of the visitors and were recognizable by wearing yellow T-shirts saying “AQUA FOTO TEAM”. The visitors could then select their photos on the monitors located at the AQUAPHOTO booth. In addition, the controller used facial recognition technology software to identify the individuals that requested their photos and offer the pictures to them.

The controller informed about its data processing operations in 4 different forms available to the visitors. However, their privacy policy was inconsistent across these different places.

1. On the amusement’s park website, the privacy policy stated that visitors would be photographed by walking up to the photographers and then obtain their photos at the AQUAPHOTO stand.
2. The section concerning “Visitor rules” published on their website further specified that visitors with minors under their guardianship may be photographed in the amusement park. If the visitors did not wish to be photographed they had to take a distinguishing sign from the employees of the AQUAPHOTO stand.
3. On the contrary, the “Terms and Conditions of Photo Services and Personal Data Processing” posted at the company’s stand said that distinguishing sign could be obtained from the amusement park’s cash desk or the photographers hired by AQUAPHOTO.
4. By a visual information poster at the amusement park’s cash desk with a text saying: 
  * Don't be afraid of the AQUAPHOTO photographer. You do not want to be photographed in red. Green wristbands make many beautiful photographs’;
  * The posted also provided that the data subjects would not receive photographs of other visitors of the amusement park.

The DPA officers were later informed by the controller that the collection of visitors’ personal and biometric data was based on two different consents:

1. Consent during the visit – the data subjects were offered two colored wristbands before entering amusement park: green for consent to pictures and red for rejecting this processing. In this case, no biometric data processing is involved.
2. Consent after the visit – after visiting the amusement park, data subjects consented to biometric data processing, allowing the system to use facial images to recognize and select their relevant photos

In addition to these inconsistencies, the DPA’s inspection revealed that the data processing practice did not meet the data protection standard the company declared.

1. the employees of the amusement park did not inform the inspection officers about the possible processing of personal data by means of photography;
2. they did not offer the officers the option to choose between the red or green wristband to express their preference regarding this type of data processing. At the ticket office, the inspection officers also noticed a sign saying: “Don’t be afraid of the AQUAPHOTO photographer” and another one in Latvian, English and Russian: “You do not want to be photographed in red. Green wristbands make many beautiful photographs’.” However, the officers also noted that the visitors did not actually wore a green wristband. The adults wore a grey one and children wore red wristbands. Additionally, the photographs were also taken at various attractions sites, such as “Unique Tornado”, “Jacuzzi” or other attractions with pools where the wristbands were not visible;
3. the officers asked if visiting the stand before entering the amusement park was required. The cashier clarified it was not obligatory; they would be photographed during their visit and could select the photos afterward at the stand;
4. none of the visitors of the park was asked for their consent before the photographs were taken;
5. despite the fact that one of the inspection officers informed the company’s employees that they visited the park alone, they were offered to buy a photo that included both them.

The officers concluded that contrary to the information provided by the amusement park and the company, the data subjects are in fact not verbally informed about the processing of their data by the means of photography carried out on the premises of the park.

The controller claimed that the DPA should consider that the consent was collected implicitly. According to the EDPB Opinion 05/2020 consent, whether explicit or not, must be given by a statement or an explicit affirmative action and must express consent to the processing of personal data. This is complemented by recital 32 GDPR which states that consent should be given by an explicit affirmative act including oral communication. Lastly, the controller raised arguments against the DPA’s inspection at the amusement park and claimed that according to Article 15 Lithuanian Data Protection Law, any inspection must take place in cooperation with the controller. Therefore, the evidence collected should be deemed invalid.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12","1. The case involves AQAPHOTO as a data controller processing personal data (including biometric data through facial recognition) of amusement park visitors, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to provide transparent information about processing operations as required by Article 12(1), as evidenced by inconsistent privacy policies across four different sources (website, visitor rules, terms and conditions, and visual posters), creating confusion about how data subjects could exercise their rights regarding photography.

3. The controller failed to obtain valid consent for processing personal data through photography, as required by Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7. The use of wristbands did not constitute valid consent because: (a) visitors were not consistently offered wristbands; (b) wristbands were not visible at attraction sites where photography occurred; and (c) no affirmative action was taken by data subjects to indicate consent, contrary to Recital 32 which requires explicit affirmative action.

4. The processing of biometric data through facial recognition technology constitutes processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), requiring explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a). The controller's claim of ""implicit consent"" violates the requirement for explicit consent, as confirmed by EDPB guidelines which state consent must be given by a clear affirmative action.

5. The controller violated the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) by taking photographs of all visitors without distinction and offering photos containing multiple individuals to single visitors, processing more data than necessary for the stated purpose.

6. The controller failed to provide information about biometric data processing prior to collection as required by Article 13, particularly regarding the purpose, legal basis, and existence of automated decision-making, as visitors were not adequately informed about facial recognition technology usage.

7. The controller's argument regarding the invalidity of the inspection under national law is irrelevant to GDPR compliance assessment, as Article 58 grants supervisory authorities investigative powers including on-site inspections, which were properly exercised in this case.

8. The cumulative effect of these violations - lack of transparency, invalid consent mechanisms, improper processing of special category data, and failure to minimize data processing - demonstrates systemic non-compliance with multiple GDPR principles and provisions.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The controller, Avanza Bank AB, used Meta’s analytics tool Meta Pixel to measure the effectiveness of the bank’s Facebook advertising. By collecting information about which pages on the controller’s website a person visited, the controller wanted to optimise its marketing measures. This tool would only collect information about a data subject’s website visits, IP addresses and information about certain unique events such as searches on the websites.

Two new functions of the analytics tool, the Automatic Advanced Matching (AAM) and the Automatic Events (AE), were activated by the controller by mistake.

The AAM looked for recognisable form fields and other sources on the controller’s website that contain information such as first name, last name and email address. It transferred data to Meta in hashed form (an irreversible one-way process that converts data into a unique string of characters) if a data subject filled in any of the five different forms of the controller’s website or mobile app. When users logged in and accepted marketing cookies, the AAM collected the personal data, including personal identification number, contact details, loan amounts on existing loans, employers, type of employment and account numbers. With this, Meta-Pixel could match the hashed data with the behaviour of data subjects to the website to obtain a more detailed profile of the data subjects. It is unknown whether this resulted in targeted advertising.

The AE analysed which buttons on the controller’s website and mobile app the user pressed and transmitted this data in plain text to Meta to then make suggestions about marketing on Facebook. However, the controller categorised visual fields as buttons on their website and mobile app. Via AE, personal data of data subjects were collected, including securities holdings and value, loan amounts, account number and email address and social security number.

The controller found out by an external source that the personal data of 500,001 to 1 million individuals were incorrectly transferred to Meta (formerly Facebook) between 15 November 2019 and 2 June 2021 by accidentally turning on these two functions of Meta Pixel. The controller, afterwards, could not determine who and how these functions were turned on.

On June 8, 2021, the Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten - ""IMY"") received the data breach notification from the controller.

The controller argued that the transfer of the data did not entail any harm or risk to the data subjects, as Meta did not use the data for its own purposes or transfer it further, and the data was erased after a request by the controller. All data was transferred by Meta pixel to Meta and the controller's own advertising account with Meta.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves Avanza Bank AB as the controller processing personal data through Meta's analytics tool (Meta Pixel), which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means in the context of the controller's establishment in the EU.

2. The controller processed special categories of personal data (including personal identification numbers, financial information, and potentially health-related data through employment type) without a valid legal basis, violating Article 9(1) which prohibits processing such data except under specific conditions. The accidental activation of AAM and AE functions meant the processing lacked explicit consent or other valid exceptions under Article 9(2).

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing was performed in accordance with the GDPR, as required by Article 24. The accidental activation of AAM and AE functions and the inability to determine how this occurred indicate a lack of proper oversight and safeguards.

4. The controller did not adhere to the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25, as the activation of these functions without intentional configuration and the collection of excessive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, financial details) show that data protection measures were not integrated into the processing activities.

5. The transfer of personal data to Meta (a third country) without ensuring adequate safeguards, such as an adequacy decision under Article 45 or appropriate safeguards under Article 46, violated Chapter V of the GDPR. The data was transferred to the US, which lacks an adequacy decision, and the controller did not implement measures like binding corporate rules or standard contractual clauses.

6. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects about the processing activities, including the accidental data transfer, as required by Articles 13 and 14. Data subjects were not informed about the extent of data collection and transfer to Meta.

7. The controller did not notify the supervisory authority of the personal data breach without undue delay, as the breach occurred between November 2019 and June 2021, but was only reported on June 8, 2021, potentially exceeding the 72-hour requirement under Article 33(1).

8. The controller's argument that no harm occurred because Meta did not use the data does not mitigate the violation, as the GDPR emphasises the protection of rights and freedoms regardless of actual harm, and the breach itself constitutes a failure to comply with processing principles under Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality).

9. The processing violated the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), as the data was collected for marketing optimization but was used beyond that purpose due to the accidental activation of AAM and AE, which collected additional personal data without a specified purpose.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The controller is a company which operates restaurants. On 26 July 2023, the controller notified the DPA about a data breach occurred on 19 July 2023: an employee had lost a flash drive containing unencrypted data about another employee, such as their address, date of birth, passport, picture and salary data. Moreover, some financial data were stored in the drive in an encrypted way.

On 26 September 2023 the DPA initiated an ex officio proceeding.

The controller stated that it had instructed all employees to encrypt their files when stored in an external flash drive and that the loss occurred in the workplace premises.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32","1. The controller is a company processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means and forms part of a filing system.
2. The loss of a flash drive containing unencrypted personal data (e.g., address, date of birth, passport, picture, salary) constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12), as it involves the accidental loss of personal data.
3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The presence of unencrypted sensitive data on a portable device indicates a failure to maintain integrity and confidentiality.
4. Article 32(1) mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The use of unencrypted storage for sensitive personal data on a flash drive—especially given its portability and risk of loss—demonstrates inadequate security measures, as encryption is a key safeguard mentioned in Article 32(1)(a).
5. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of it. The breach occurred on 19 July 2023, and notification was made on 26 July 2023, suggesting a delay of 7 days. If the controller became aware on or shortly after 19 July, this exceeds the 72-hour window, constituting undue delay.
6. The controller's statement that employees were instructed to encrypt files but the data was still unencrypted indicates that organisational measures were insufficient or not enforced, further violating Article 32(1) and (2), which require ensuring that persons acting under the controller's authority process data only on instructions and with appropriate security.
7. The breach involves data that could be considered special categories under Article 9 (e.g., biometric data from the passport) or sensitive personal data, heightening the risk and the need for stricter safeguards, which were not in place.
8. Therefore, the controller failed to comply with multiple provisions of the GDPR, including Articles 5(1)(f), 32, and 33, leading to the NONCOMPLIANT verdict."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a media company (the controller) had requested the data subject to deliver a signed form to the controller's premises in order to exercise the right of access. The data subject made an access request by email but did not provide any other information to confirm their identity. Therefore, the controller did not provide access to the personal data.

The DPA had asked the controller to explain why it had refused to comply with the data subject's request and how it had facilitated the exercise of data subject rights.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it could not comply with the data subject's request because the data subject had not provided additional information to confirm their identity. The controller stated that the data subject must identify themselves by means of a form containing the data subject's name, personal identification number, address, telephone number and email address.

The controller also noted that the form must be signed and delivered in person to the controller's premises, where the data subject must identify themselves with a government-issued ID.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 58","1. The case involves a data subject making an access request under Article 15 of the GDPR (Right of access by the data subject) and a controller (media company) requiring specific identification procedures before complying.

2. Under Article 12(1), the controller must take appropriate measures to provide any communication relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

3. Under Article 12(2), the controller must facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15-22. The controller's requirement for the data subject to deliver a signed form in person to their premises with specific personal information (name, personal identification number, address, telephone number, email address) and present a government-issued ID does not constitute facilitation but rather creates an unnecessary barrier to exercising rights.

4. Under Article 12(6), the controller may request additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject only where the controller has ""reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request."" In this case, the controller automatically required additional identification without demonstrating any specific reasonable doubts about the identity of the requester.

5. The controller's requirement for physical delivery of a signed form contradicts the principle of facilitating rights through appropriate measures, as electronic means (like the email used by the data subject) should generally be acceptable unless there are specific security concerns not demonstrated here.

6. The controller's blanket requirement for excessive personal information (including personal identification number) and physical presentation of government-issued ID goes beyond what is ""necessary"" for identity confirmation under Article 12(6) and violates the data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c)).

7. Therefore, the controller failed to comply with their obligations under Article 12 to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and only request additional identification information when reasonable doubts exist about identity.

8. The case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a bus operator (the controller) had published the personal phone numbers of its bus drivers on the company intranet, although the drivers also had a personal business phone provided by the controller. The DPA then asked the controller to explain the purpose for which it processed the personal phone numbers of its drivers.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it published the personal phone numbers of its drivers in the company's intranet telephone directory because it was necessary for the drivers to be able to communicate with each other by phone while on duty. The controller emphasised that each employee had a personal password for the intranet in order to ensure the technical protection of personal data. In the controller's view, the processing was based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as it was necessary for the performance of the employment contract.

Regarding the separate business phones, the controller stated that they were primarily intended for mobile data use only, as the use of the phone was restricted so that it could only be used to make calls to specifically authorised numbers, such as supervisors and emergency numbers. It was therefore impossible to communicate with other drivers during the working day using only the business phone.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 58","1. The case involves a controller (the bus operator) processing personal data (personal phone numbers) of data subjects (bus drivers) as defined in Article 4 of the GDPR, where personal data includes any information relating to an identifiable natural person.

2. The controller published the personal phone numbers on the company intranet for the purpose of facilitating communication between drivers during duty, claiming this processing was necessary for the performance of the employment contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.

3. Article 5(1)(c) GDPR requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization principle). Here, the purpose is communication between drivers, but the controller provided business phones that could potentially be configured to allow calls between drivers, thereby achieving the same purpose without processing personal phone numbers.

4. Since an alternative, less intrusive means exists (configuring business phones for inter-driver communication), the processing of personal phone numbers is not necessary, violating the data minimization principle of Article 5(1)(c).

5. Article 6(1)(b) GDPR allows processing only if it is necessary for the performance of a contract. Given that the business phones could be used instead, the processing of personal phone numbers is not strictly necessary, invalidating the legal basis under Article 6(1)(b).

6. The controller's implementation of technical protection (passwords for the intranet) may address security under Article 32, but it does not justify the initial collection and publication of personal data that is not necessary, as required by Article 5(1)(c).

7. Therefore, the processing fails to comply with the core principles of GDPR, specifically data minimization and lawfulness of processing.

8. Thus, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The controller is an Italian municipality which decided to implement a mobile application. This application was made available on app stores between December 2020 and January 2021. It allowed citizens to send notifications to the Local Police about unsafe areas. After getting this notification, the Police could use the video surveillance system to monitor the area. Therefore, personal data of both the person who made the report and the people recorded by the camera were collected.

The software collected the phone number of the reporting person and the location data. The former was then stored for 7 days, allowing the Police to contact the person to get more details about the incident. After 7 days, only location data was kept in an anonymised way.

The controller decided not to manage this app on itself, but to outsource the development and the management of both the app and the video surveillance system to a company which is owned by the municipality.

The application was temporarily deactivated from April to June 2022. On 11 July 2022 it was permanently deactivated, after the DPA started an investigation on the matter.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32, Article 35","1. The case involves an Italian municipality (a public authority) acting as a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, processing personal data through a mobile application that collects phone numbers and location data from reporting citizens and video surveillance footage of individuals in reported areas.

2. The processing lacks a valid lawful basis under Article 6(1). While public authorities may rely on ""performance of a task carried out in the public interest"" (Article 6(1)(e)), such processing must be based on Union or Member State law (Article 6(3)). The case does not indicate any specific legal authorization for this data processing operation, making it noncompliant.

3. The controller outsourced development and management to a company owned by the municipality without establishing a data processing agreement as required by Article 28(3). This violates the mandatory contractual obligations between controllers and processors, including requirements for documented instructions, security measures, and sub-processing authorizations.

4. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects as required by Articles 13 and 14. Individuals whose data was collected through the app or video surveillance were not properly informed about the processing purposes, legal basis, data retention periods, or their rights, particularly regarding the video surveillance which captures non-reporting individuals.

5. The data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) was violated by collecting phone numbers when location data alone might have sufficed for the stated purpose of identifying unsafe areas, and by using video surveillance which processes excessive personal data beyond what is necessary for the specified purpose.

6. The storage of phone numbers for 7 days and subsequent anonymization of location data raises concerns about compliance with the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e)), as the necessity of this retention period was not demonstrated and the anonymization process was not verified for effectiveness.

7. The video surveillance processing likely violates Article 10 regarding processing of personal data relating to criminal offences, as monitoring ""unsafe areas"" may involve processing data related to potential criminal activities without proper authorization or safeguards under official authority.

8. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Toyota Bank Poland S.A. (controller) is a bank established under Polish law. On 31 March 2021 an employee of the controller, by mistake, sent a letter with personal data of the data subject to another client. The letter contained personal data from the loan agreement concluded between the data subject and the controller, specifically: name, surname, bank account number, address, national ID number (PESEL),  ID number. The (incorrect) addressee picked-up and opened the letter. Eventually, the controller took the letter back by sending a courier.

The controller registered the incident within the internal register and performed a risk assessment. During the risk assessment, the controller took into account European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) data breach guideline https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/dbn-severity ENISA Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal data breaches. According to the controller, the breach affected only one person, the letter was swiftly retrieved and the (incorrect) addressee was the controller’s client and helped to solve the problem. Because of that, the controller assigned the breach a low-risk level. Hence, the controller did not notify the DPA. Nevertheless, the controller decided to inform the data subject about the breach by sending a letter.

The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA, claiming the controller unlawfully disclosed their personal data. During the complaint proceedings, on 7 September 2022, the controller notified the DPA about the breach. The notification was done almost 18 months after the breach. The controller explained the late notification with the minor risk assigned to the breach.

As a consequence of late data breach notification, the DPA initiated ex officio proceedings regarding the violation of Article 33(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 33,"1. The case involves Toyota Bank Poland S.A. as the controller and a data subject whose personal data was disclosed to an incorrect recipient due to an employee error on 31 March 2021, constituting a personal data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR.

2. Article 33(1) GDPR requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. The controller became aware of the breach immediately on 31 March 2021 when the erroneous disclosure occurred, as evidenced by their internal registration of the incident and subsequent risk assessment.

4. The controller did not notify the DPA until 7 September 2022, nearly 18 months after becoming aware of the breach, which far exceeds the 72-hour requirement stipulated in Article 33(1).

5. The controller's justification for the delay—assigning a ""low-risk level"" based on their internal assessment using ENISA guidelines—does not exempt them from the notification obligation, as Article 33(1) mandates notification unless the breach is unlikely to result in any risk, which requires an objective assessment rather than a subjective determination by the controller.

6. The breached data included sensitive personal identifiers (name, surname, bank account number, address, national ID number, and ID number), which inherently pose a risk to the data subject's rights and freedoms, such as identity theft, fraud, or other misuse, contradicting the controller's ""low-risk"" classification.

7. The controller's action of informing the data subject about the breach does not substitute for the mandatory notification to the supervisory authority under Article 33(1).

8. The DPA initiated ex officio proceedings due to the violation of Article 33(1), confirming that the delay in notification constituted a breach of the GDPR.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with Article 33(1) of the GDPR."
"Following an investigation in 2019-2020, the EDPS isdues recommendations and the Commission modified the ILA. The EDPS investigated whether these modifications were sufficient to bring processing in compliance with data protection requirements and found infringements. Data accessed by Microsoft are: -	identity and contact data of users (when signing on to the service and when checking the licenses) -	data generated by the users while using the software -	data generated by Microsoft based on the usage of the software The EDPS found that the processing presents significant risks as -	it monitors the behaviour of users, -	combines datasets and -	even uses artificial intelligence Reference date is the 12th May 2021, the date when the investigation was launched. Some measures were taken meanwhile by the Commission, which were taken into account in the recommendations issued.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 28, Article 46","1. The case involves processing of personal data by the European Commission (controller) through Microsoft software, including identity/contact data, user-generated data, and Microsoft-generated usage data, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR (Article 2).

2. The processing operations involve monitoring of user behavior, combination of datasets, and use of artificial intelligence, which constitute profiling and automated processing under Article 4(4) and Article 22, requiring specific safeguards under Article 22(2)-(3).

3. The investigation found the Commission failed to establish a proper legal basis for processing under Article 6, particularly as a public authority which must rely on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest) rather than consent, and failed to meet the higher threshold for processing special categories of data under Article 9 where applicable.

4. The Commission violated transparency obligations under Articles 13-14 by not adequately informing data subjects about the purposes, legal basis, data combinations, AI processing, and international transfers involving Microsoft as a processor.

5. The controller failed to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25, as the processing design enabled excessive monitoring and profiling without built-in safeguards like pseudonymization or data minimization.

6. Security obligations under Article 32 were breached, as the processing allowed Microsoft excessive access to EU data without sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

7. The international data transfers to Microsoft (a U.S. entity) lacked appropriate safeguards under Chapter V, particularly after the Schrems II decision invalidated the Privacy Shield, requiring supplementary measures that were not implemented.

8. The Commission failed to conduct proper Data Protection Impact Assessments under Article 35 for high-risk processing involving systematic monitoring, profiling, and AI, as required by Article 35(3)(a) and (b).

9. The corrective measures taken during the investigation were insufficient to address the fundamental violations of principles under Article 5(1)(a)(c)(f) (lawfulness, minimization, security) and specific obligations regarding processors under Article 28.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 11 December 2023, the DPA initiated an investigation concerning the processing of personal data in relation to the Visa Information System (VIS), carried out by the Ministry of Immigration and Integration (Udlændinge- og Integrationsminister – UIM) through its system IVR-VIS.

The DPA focused its investigation on the deletion practices of the controller. The DPA noted that, according to the deletion policy, visa cases should be automatically deleted after 5 years from, for example, the expiration of a visa, date of refusal, confirmation, etc.

However, the investigation showed that the controller had so far not monitored compliance with its own deletion policy. Moreover, there was no policy for premature deletion when a visa applicant obtains Danish citizenship by naturalization in accordance with Article 25(1) VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008. According to this article, when a visa applicant obtains the citizenship of a Member State, data relating to their application file must be deleted without delay from the VIS even if the normal data retention period of 5 years, set by Article 23(1) VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008, has not expired yet.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves the Ministry of Immigration and Integration (UIM) as a data controller processing personal data through the Visa Information System (VIS), which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1), as it involves processing of personal data by automated means.

2. The controller's deletion policy states that visa cases should be automatically deleted after 5 years from certain events (e.g., visa expiration, refusal, etc.), which aligns with the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, requiring that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes.

3. However, the investigation revealed that the controller had not monitored compliance with its own deletion policy, violating Article 24(1) of the GDPR, which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation.

4. Additionally, the controller lacked a policy for premature deletion when a visa applicant obtains Danish citizenship by naturalization, as required by Article 25(1) of the VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008, which mandates immediate deletion in such cases. This failure violates Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR (integrity and confidentiality principle) and Article 32(1)(b) (ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems), as proper deletion procedures are part of security measures.

5. The retention of data beyond the necessary period, especially when immediate deletion is required by specific regulations, contravenes the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, as data is not erased when it is no longer necessary for the purposes.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The controller AS Watson (Health & Beauty Continental Europe) B.V. is a financial holding company that manages and operates several wholesale and retail businesses. One of them is Kruidvat, a Dutch retail, pharmacy and drugstore chain.

In 2019, the Dutch DPA (“Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens”) started an investigation into different websites, including Kruidvat.nl, to review whether the websites complied with the GDPR when placing (tracking) cookies. On first glance, the DPA found that the website did not seem to comply with the requirements of obtaining consent under the GDPR. Therefore, the DPA send a letter to the controller on 29 November 2019, which stated that the controller presumably did not comply with the law on obtaining consent for tracking cookies.  The DPA encouraged the controller in the letter to change its practices for obtaining consent for tracking cookies.

After multiple reviews, the DPA found that the controller still did not change its practices on 16 June 2020. The DPA therefore decided to launch an ex officio investigation into the controller.

In their investigation, the DPA found that the controller placed tracking cookies before obtaining consent from users via a cookie banner. The DPA also found that “accept all cookies” on the controller’s cookie banner was selected by default. Only after clicking through four different steps, was the user able to reject cookies.

The controller argued that the investigation by the DPA was unlawful, because the DPA entered the controller's virtual premises without the controller's consent or knowledge. The DPA also had no legal basis for starting an investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a controller (AS Watson (Health & Beauty Continental Europe) B.V.) processing personal data through tracking cookies on its website Kruidvat.nl, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1), as it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The controller placed tracking cookies before obtaining user consent, which constitutes processing of personal data without a lawful basis under Article 6(1). For non-essential cookies, consent is required under Article 6(1)(a) and must meet the standards defined in Article 4(11) and Article 7.

3. The controller's cookie banner had ""accept all cookies"" pre-selected by default. According to Recital 32 of the GDPR, consent cannot be inferred from pre-ticked boxes or inactivity. This violates the requirement for explicit and affirmative action under Article 4(11) and Article 7(1).

4. Users were required to navigate through four steps to reject cookies, making it significantly more difficult to refuse consent than to accept it. This violates Article 7(3), which requires that withdrawing consent should be as easy as giving it, and undermines the requirement that consent must be freely given under Article 4(11).

5. The controller argued that the DPA's investigation was unlawful, but Article 58(1)(f) grants supervisory authorities the power to access any premises of the controller, including virtual premises, for investigative purposes. The DPA acted within its authority under Chapter VI of the GDPR.

6. The controller's practices failed to meet the standards for valid consent as outlined in Article 7 and Recital 32, resulting in unlawful processing of personal data under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital in Rome reported a data breach involving its ""Charter of Health"" portal. On a specified day, a patient mistakenly accessed another patient's report due to a software error. The issue stemmed from the Dedalus Dnlab software provided by Dedalus Italia S.p.A., which sent incorrect patient identifiers in HL7 messages. This caused reports to be wrongly associated with patients in the hospital's integrated systems. The breach affected 24 reports.

The hospital promptly notified authorities and took corrective actions, including requesting Dedalus to implement non-regression testing to prevent future occurrences. They also communicated with affected patients and provided additional support.

Dedalus contended that it was not contractually required to perform regular vulnerability assessments and argued that the error was accidental and limited in scope. They claimed the breach was due to an isolated incident and requested either the closure of the case or a lesser penalty.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 28, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83","1. The case involves Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital as a data controller and Dedalus Italia S.p.A. as a data processor, processing personal data including health data (a special category under Article 9) through the ""Charter of Health"" portal.

2. The software error resulted in a patient accessing another patient's medical reports, constituting unauthorized disclosure of personal data in violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)), which requires processing that ensures appropriate security of personal data.

3. The breach involved health data, which is a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), requiring higher protection measures. The incident occurred due to inadequate technical safeguards in the Dedalus Dnlab software, specifically incorrect patient identifiers in HL7 messages, indicating insufficient data protection by design and by default (Article 25).

4. As controller, the hospital is responsible under Article 24 for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with GDPR. The breach demonstrates failure to ensure the processor (Dedalus) implemented sufficient security measures, particularly regarding data accuracy and access controls.

5. Under Article 32, controllers and processors must implement appropriate technical measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The software vulnerability that allowed incorrect data association represents a failure to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and resilience of processing systems.

6. While the hospital took corrective actions after the breach, including notifying authorities and requesting testing from Dedalus, the prior existence of the vulnerability and the occurrence of the breach indicate noncompliance with preventive security obligations under Articles 24, 25, and 32.

7. Dedalus's contention that they were not contractually required to perform regular vulnerability assessments does not absolve either party of GDPR obligations, as Article 28 requires processors to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to meet GDPR requirements regardless of contractual terms.

8. The breach affected 24 patients' reports, constituting a non-trivial incident that compromised the confidentiality of special category data, further emphasizing the seriousness of the security failure.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller, a health authority, sent an email to 45 data subjects containing instructions on how to get medications used to cure multiple sclerosis. The person sending the email put the email addresses of the recipients in the “cc” field instead of choosing the “bcc” one. This resulted in the email addresses of the data subject being disclosed to each other.

After receiving a report by one of the data subject, the controller made a data breach notification to the DPA according to Article 33(1) GDPR.

The controller argued that the data breach happened due to a human mistake and that it had repeatedly instructed its employees to use the “bcc” field when sending emails to multiple people.

Moreover, the controller pointed out that the number of data subjects concerned was quite low and that the breach lasted for a short period of time.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9","1. The case involves a controller (health authority) processing personal data (email addresses) of 45 data subjects, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller disclosed email addresses to unauthorized recipients by using the ""cc"" field instead of ""bcc,"" violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized disclosure.

3. The disclosure constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), as it involved unauthorized disclosure of personal data transmitted by email.

4. While the controller reported the breach to the DPA under Article 33(1), which is compliant, the breach itself resulted from insufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure data security, violating Article 32(1), which requires appropriate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

5. The controller's argument about human error and repeated instructions to use ""bcc"" does not absolve responsibility, as Article 24(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, which in this case was inadequate to prevent the breach.

6. The number of affected data subjects (45) and short duration do not mitigate the violation, as the breach exposed sensitive health-related information (medication instructions for multiple sclerosis), increasing the risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms under Article 32(2).

7. The case involves processing of data concerning health (implied by the context of multiple sclerosis medication), which is a special category under Article 9(1), requiring stricter safeguards under Article 9(2), but the controller failed to implement such safeguards.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1), and 9(1), as the controller did not ensure appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal data."
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the application operated by the Finnish Golf Union (the controller) contained vulnerabilities related to authentication and password policies, including the use of people's dates of birth as default passwords and the failure to use multi-factor authentication. The DPA then asked the controller to explain how its app worked.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that no passwords were used to log in to its golf app, but rather the individual's membership number, the first two letters of their first and last name and their year of birth. The Golf Union membership number consists of a country part, a club part and a membership number, e.g. fi-123-4321, of which the last 4 digits make up the actual membership number.

The controller considered that the login policy was adequate from a security perspective. The controller stated that obtaining the information required for login required research from several sources and could not be directly deduced by a third party. The controller emphasised that the user could also change the default password at a later stage.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32, Article 58","1. The case involves the Finnish Golf Union as a data controller processing personal data through its golf application, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 4(7) and Article 2(1).

2. The controller's authentication method uses individuals' membership numbers (which include personal identifiers), first two letters of first and last names, and year of birth as login credentials, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(1) and (2).

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.

4. Article 32(1) specifically mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the state of the art, costs of implementation, and nature of processing.

5. The authentication method described relies on static, predictable elements (names, birth year, membership numbers) that could be reasonably deduced or obtained through research, failing to provide adequate protection against unauthorized access.

6. The controller's claim that this method is adequate because the information ""requires research from several sources"" does not meet the GDPR's requirement for appropriate security measures, as Article 32(1) emphasizes the need for measures that ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems.

7. The use of personal data (including birth year) as authentication credentials increases the risk of unauthorized access to personal data, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality in Article 5(1)(f).

8. The controller's option for users to change the default password does not mitigate the initial security vulnerability, as the fundamental authentication mechanism remains inadequate and does not implement state-of-the-art security measures such as multi-factor authentication or proper password policies.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically violating Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) regarding appropriate security measures for personal data processing."
"The DPA carried out a control check on the institutional website of the public administration (""Controller”), and verified it was not possible to find the contact details of the DPO. Besides that, the Controller didn't communicate the DPO's contact details to the DPA in a dedicated channel for that purpose.

Therefore, the investigations carried out found no evidence of the appointment of the DPO by the Controller.

The DPA notified the Controller based on the Article 58(2)GDPR related to the lack of publication and communication to the Authority of the DPO's contact informations and the lack of proof that a DPO have been designated, consequently violating Article 37 (1) and Article 37 (7)GDPR.

The Controller submitted its defence, stating, among other things, that:

- A employee of the Entity was designated DPO, but besides the DPO role itself, they held (and still holds) other professional roles, such as head of several services within the Entity (Secretariat of the Director of Sector I, Assistance to the Bodies, Information Systems, Tourism and ultimately the Legal Service);

- The DPO'S contact have been on display on the controller's website and on Transparent Administration since before the notification received;

- The controller immediately informed the DPA about the DPO's contact details after receiving the notification;

- The nominated DPO fulfilled theirs duties before and after their referral, and they also produced two courses on data protection.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 37, Article 38","1. The case involves a public administration (""Controller"") which qualifies as a public authority under Article 37(1) of the GDPR, requiring the mandatory appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO).

2. The DPA's investigation found no evidence of the DPO's appointment (violating Article 37(1)), and the Controller failed to publish the DPO's contact details on its website and communicate them to the DPA (violating Article 37(7)).

3. The Controller's defense acknowledged the DPO held multiple professional roles (e.g., head of Secretariat, Information Systems, Legal Service), which creates a conflict of interest under Article 38(6) as these roles involve determining purposes and means of processing, incompatible with the DPO's independent advisory role under Article 39.

4. While the Controller claimed the DPO's contacts were displayed on its website and Transparent Administration, the DPA's verified inability to find them constitutes a violation of Article 37(7)'s publication requirement.

5. The Controller's post-notification communication of DPO details does not remedy the prior violation of Article 37(7)'s obligation to proactively communicate these details to the DPA.

6. The DPO's performance of data protection training courses does not mitigate the core violations of appointment, publication, communication, and conflict of interest requirements under Articles 37 and 38.

"The Electoral Commission (“the controller”) servers were accessed by an unknown threat actor on 3 separate occasions. As a result of the incident, the personal data of individuals in the electoral register were affected which contained the names and home addresses of approximately 40,000,000 data subjects.

During the course of this incident, three separate clusters of activity were identified: 1. 24 August 2021, hacker gained access to an on-premise Microsoft exchange server using a security flaw known as the ProxyShell vulnerability chain. The hackers then pretended to be a legitimate user, which allowed them to install hidden programs (web shells) on the server. These programs were used again on 16 September 2021, 13 June 2022 and 02 August 2022. Beginning 14 March 2022, the hacker also installed hidden access points (backdoors) on the system. 2. On 14 March 2022, another hacker exploited the vulnerabilities in the ProxyShell. It could not be determined at this point if the hacker retained the previous access or re-compromised the system again.  3. On 28 October 2021, an employee reported that spam emails were being sent from the controllers server but they were not in the individuals sent items folder on Outlook.

Following the third incident, the server was shut down and scrubbed before being restarted.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves the Electoral Commission as the data controller, processing personal data of approximately 40,000,000 data subjects (names and home addresses) in the electoral register, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2.

2. The controller experienced multiple security breaches where unknown threat actors gained unauthorized access to their systems on three separate occasions (August 2021, September 2021, and June-August 2022), resulting in a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. The repeated breaches through known vulnerabilities (ProxyShell) indicate insufficient security measures.

4. Article 5(1)(f) mandates that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing. The multiple successful attacks demonstrate a failure to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.

5. Article 33 requires controllers to notify supervisory authorities of a personal data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. The case does not specify notification timing, but the scale (40 million affected) suggests high risk requiring notification.

6. Article 34 requires communication of the breach to data subjects when it is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The exposure of names and home addresses creates such risks (e.g., identity theft, harassment).

7. The repeated nature of the breaches (three separate incidents over 12 months) shows a failure to implement adequate preventive measures after the initial breach, violating the principle of accountability under Article 5(2) and the security requirements under Article 32.

8. The controller's response (shutting down and scrubbing the server only after the third incident) indicates reactive rather than proactive security measures, failing to demonstrate compliance with Articles 24 and 25 regarding data protection by design and by default.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of security obligations, breach notification requirements, and data protection principles under Articles 5, 24, 25, 32, 33, and 34."
"The municipality of Vejen (the controller) reported a personal data breach to the Danish DPA (“Datatilsynet”) because five laptops had been stolen.

The computers were only intended for the use by teachers and students as part of the teaching programme. In practice, however, they were also used by teachers for things such as student progress reports and class handovers. Therefore, the computers contained more information about the students, including if they had for example special challenges. None of the computers were encrypted.

After the DPA’s investigation of the breach, they found that there were up to 300 computers in the municipality that were not encrypted and also contained personal data of children.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the municipality of Vejen as a data controller processing personal data of students, including sensitive information such as special challenges, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 4 (definitions of 'personal data' and 'controller') and Article 9 (special categories of data).

2. The controller stored personal data on laptops without implementing encryption, despite the sensitive nature of the data (including information about children's special challenges) and the risk of theft. Article 32(1)(a) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical measures, such as encryption, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

3. The personal data breached included special categories of data (e.g., health-related information about students' special challenges), which under Article 9 requires stricter protection measures. The lack of encryption fails to provide the heightened safeguards demanded for such data.

4. Article 5(1)(f) mandates that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access or loss. The theft of unencrypted laptops containing personal data constitutes a failure to meet this integrity and confidentiality principle.

5. The controller's failure to encrypt the laptops, despite the known risk of theft and the sensitive nature of the data, demonstrates non-compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), which requires controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR's principles.

6. The DPA's discovery of up to 300 additional unencrypted computers containing personal data further indicates a systemic failure to implement adequate security measures across the organization, violating Article 32's requirement for appropriate technical and organizational measures.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically violating Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 9, and 32."
"AFIANZA ASESORES, S.L. is a consultancy company engaged in, among other work, the provision of legal advice. A USB stick with a large amount of personal data, including data pertaining to a criminal proceeding, was stolen. The USB was not encrypted.

The controller conducted an internal investigation. It informed the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of the incident 13 days after its occurrence. On 2 July 2021, the AEPD ordered the controller to communicate the breach to data subjects.

On 24 June 2022, the AEPD initiated sanctioning proceedings against the controller and proposed a sanction of €160,000. The AEPD considered that the controller had suffered a breach resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The AEPD noted that it considered the controller’s storage of personal data on a removable device without encryption negligent, resulting in an aggravating factor for the fine.

The controller argued that there was no evidence that a third party had ever accessed the information contained in the USB. Instead, the infringing ‘disclosure’ or ‘breach’ was entirely hypothetical. Thus, the controller argued, it could not be proved that any third party ever improperly accessed the information contained in the USB and no breach of confidentiality could be demonstrated.

The controller also argued that it protected its data diligently and had adequate security measures in place. For instance, all personnel with access to personal data were instructed of their obligations and responsibilities. It also conducted IT audits to verify appropriate measures and security standards in place. The controller emphasised that Article 32 GDPR does not regulate a closed list of security measures – instead, it requires the controller to apply appropriate measures. It thus challenged the focus of the sanctioning proceedings on the absence of encryption on the USB because it was not an obligatory security measure and this did not take account of the controller’s other security measures. Penalising this, the controller argued, was contrary to the principle of culpability.

The controller also defended its delay in notifying the AEPD of the breach, stating that in the 13 days it conducted an internal investigation. It argued that the 72 hour period articulated in Article 33 GDPR is not imperative.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller (AFIANZA ASESORES, S.L.) processing personal data, including special category data related to criminal proceedings, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2.

2. The controller stored personal data on an unencrypted USB stick that was stolen, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) GDPR, which is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data.

3. Article 32(1) GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including considering the state of the art and the nature of the data. Given that the data included information pertaining to criminal proceedings (a special category under Article 10), the risk was high, and encryption would be a standard appropriate measure for portable devices.

4. The controller failed to implement encryption on the USB stick, which is a violation of Article 32(1) GDPR. The controller's argument that Article 32 does not prescribe a closed list of measures is valid in principle, but the absence of encryption for sensitive data on a portable device, considering the state of the art and the high risk, constitutes negligence and a failure to implement appropriate safeguards.

5. Article 33(1) GDPR requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The controller notified the AEPD 13 days after the breach, which is a clear violation of this article, as the 72-hour period is imperative unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. The internal investigation does not justify a delay of this magnitude.

6. The controller argued that there was no evidence of third-party access, but Article 33 notification is required when there is a breach of security that may result in a risk, not only when unauthorized access is proven. The theft of an unencrypted device containing sensitive data inherently presents a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, triggering the notification obligation under Article 33(1) and the communication obligation under Article 34(1) if the risk is high.

7. The AEPD's order to communicate the breach to data subjects under Article 34 was appropriate, as the breach was likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, given the sensitive nature of the data (criminal proceedings).

8. The controller's failure to implement encryption and the delayed notification are infringements of Articles 32 and 33, which are subject to administrative fines under Article 83(4) GDPR, up to €10,000,000 or 2% of annual global turnover.

9. The AEPD considered the absence of encryption as negligent, which is an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(b) GDPR (intentional or negligent character of the infringement). The nature of the data (criminal) is also an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(g) (categories of personal data affected).

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"A hackers group attacked one of Polish companies of medical sector - American Heart of Poland SA. The hackers got access to company’s network drives and installed a ransomware software. Following categories of personal data of approximately 21,000 company’s employees and patients was affected:

* Name, surname, name of parents, date of birthday, e-mail address, phone number.
* Address data.
* PESEL number, ID number.
* Bank account number, financial data.
* Data concerning health.
* Credentials of company’s user account. 

The hackers demanded ransom of USD 3,000,000. To make the company paid the ransom, the hackers shared a sample of obtained data on a Darknet website.

Due to the lost of data availability and confidentiality of the data, the company acting as a data controller, notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about the breach, under Article 33 GDPR. In response, the DPA initiated the investigation.

Initially, the controller didn’t find the source of data breach. However, after in-depth analysis of third-party specialist, it turned out that lack of company’s software update led to the breach – there was an exploit within the software, making it possible to gain exterbal control over one of the devices connected to the software. Company’s IT department, responsible for the update failed to do so. Also, the ISO audit of the controller didn't mention the exploit. Moreover, inadequate passwords quality and a phishing attack were indicated as a potential source of the breach.

Additionally, during the investigation, the DPA found the controller stored the data affected by the breach contrary to their own policy – data relating to health had to be stored on a specific drives, not network ones.

The data controller was actively involved in handling the data breach, inter alia by facilitating contact with data subjects (by a dedicated call centre).

The outcome of investigation and identified shortcomings caused the DPA open an ex-officio proceedings against the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves American Heart of Poland SA, a medical sector company acting as a data controller, processing sensitive personal data including health data (Article 9(1)), which requires enhanced protection under GDPR.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically:
   - The lack of software updates left an exploit unpatched, allowing external control of devices (violating Article 32(1)(b) on ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems).
   - Inadequate password quality and susceptibility to phishing attacks violated Article 32(1)(a) regarding pseudonymisation and encryption measures, and Article 32(1)(d) on processes for testing security effectiveness.

3. The controller stored health data on network drives contrary to their own policy, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)) and the requirement for appropriate security measures (Article 32(1)), as health data requires stricter safeguards under Article 9.

4. The ISO audit's failure to identify the exploit indicates insufficient monitoring of technical measures, violating the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) and the requirement for regular testing of security measures (Article 32(1)(d)).

5. The breach affected approximately 21,000 individuals and involved special categories of data (health data, national identification numbers, financial data), which constitutes a high-risk processing activity under Article 35(3)(a) and (b), yet the controller failed to conduct a proper Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as mandated by Article 35(1) to address these risks.

6. The controller's IT department's failure to update software and implement strong authentication measures demonstrates a lack of adequate organizational measures and staff training, violating Article 32(4) on ensuring anyone acting under the authority of the controller processes data only on instructions.

7. While the controller notified the DPA under Article 33 and facilitated data subject communication, these reactive measures do not compensate for the proactive security failures that led to the breach.

8. The DPA's investigation revealed multiple violations of GDPR principles, including security (Article 32), data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) as excessive data was accessible, and accountability (Article 5(2)).

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to systemic failures in implementing appropriate technical and organizational security measures, particularly for high-risk health data processing, and violations of multiple articles including 5, 9, 32, and 35."
"A Swedish pharmacy company - Apoteket AB (the controller) was using the Meta pixel for marketing purposes since 2017. The purpose of the pixel was to measure the controller’s marketing activity within Facebook and Instagram and additionally to promote controller’s products to visitors of certain pages (self-care product category). By default, the controller disabled the pixel within the part of the website dedicated to the prescription goods. At the same time, the pixel collected the data about other products offered by the controller, in particular products to treat variety of disorders (for example allergy or stomach disorder) or sexual wellness products.

In 2020, an employee of controller, acting without the authorisation or knowledge of the controller, activated Advanced Matching function of the pixel. The employee was one of three employees managing the pixel within the controller structure. As a result, the controller was provided with supplementary data, which was not necessary for the purposes of data processing, as the pixel collected more data referring to the customers. Additionally, the additional data was transferred to Meta.

When a customer made a purchase with the controller, Meta received hashed data related to the customer, namely the contact data, name and surname, social security data, address data. Meta was then able to match the data with Facebook user ID and eventually deleted the hashed data. The estimated number of data subjects affected by the incident was up to 930,000.

As soon as the controller identified the new settings of the pixel (2022), they disabled the Advanced Matching function. The controller requested Meta to delete the data collected via the pixel. Meta explained they already deleted the data older than two years ago and regarding a newer data, Meta claimed to be unable to delete them manually. Additionally, the controller published an announcement on their website, informing the data subjects about the current situation. Moreover, the controller implemented new technical and organisational measures to reduce the risk of future violations of that kind (inter alia, additional screening of cookie settings of the website, e-learning course for the employees).

The controller notified the Swedish DPA (IMY) about the incident.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Apoteket AB as the data controller processing personal data through the Meta pixel, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The data processed included information related to health conditions (e.g., allergies, stomach disorders) and sexual wellness products, which constitute special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), requiring explicit consent or other specific conditions for lawful processing. The controller did not obtain explicit consent for processing this sensitive data, violating Article 9(2)(a).

3. The Advanced Matching function collected supplementary data (contact details, name, surname, social security data, address data) beyond what was necessary for the stated marketing purposes, violating the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), which requires that personal data be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary.

4. The transfer of personal data to Meta (a U.S.-based company) occurred without appropriate safeguards as required under Chapter V (Articles 44-49). There is no indication that the transfer was based on an adequacy decision, appropriate safeguards, or any valid derogation, violating Article 44.

5. The unauthorized activation of Advanced Matching by an employee demonstrates a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default, as required by Article 25, and to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and resilience of processing systems under Article 32(1)(b).

6. The controller failed to prevent unauthorized processing by employees, violating Article 29, which requires that persons acting under the authority of the controller process data only on instructions from the controller.

7. The controller's delayed discovery (from 2020 to 2022) of the Advanced Matching activation indicates insufficient monitoring and security measures, failing to comply with the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the obligation to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk under Article 32.

8. Meta's inability to manually delete the more recent data collected via the pixel violates the data subject's right to erasure (""right to be forgotten"") under Article 17, as the controller is responsible for ensuring that processors comply with data subject requests.

9. Although the controller took remedial actions (disabling Advanced Matching, requesting data deletion, notifying the DPA, and implementing new measures), these actions occurred after the breach and do not rectify the prior violations of Articles 5, 9, 17, 25, 29, 32, and Chapter V.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA opened an ex officio investigation after it learned from social media that the controller, a municipality, had implemented a new app which allows citizens to report crimes.

The controller pointed out that this app helps to detect the parts of the town with more crimes and is, therefore, to be regarded as to fulfill the controller’s “judiciary police” tasks.

Moreover, it noted that only a small amount of the population has actually downloaded it.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28","1. The case involves a municipality (controller) processing personal data through a crime-reporting app, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data by a public authority.

2. The controller claims the processing is for ""judiciary police"" tasks, which would require a legal basis under Article 6. However, processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses is specifically governed by Article 10, which requires that such processing be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union/Member State law with appropriate safeguards.

3. The controller has not demonstrated that the processing is carried out under official authority or pursuant to a specific legal authorization meeting the requirements of Article 10, as it merely references its general ""judiciary police"" tasks without citing specific legal provisions.

4. The processing involves criminal offense data, which constitutes special category data under Article 10, requiring heightened protections. The controller has not shown that appropriate safeguards are in place as required by Article 10.

5. The controller argues that only a small portion of the population downloaded the app, but this does not mitigate the fundamental requirement for a proper legal basis and safeguards under Article 10.

6. Additionally, the controller likely failed to provide adequate information to data subjects as required by Articles 13 and 14, given that the DPA learned about the app through social media rather than through proper transparency measures.

7. The processing may also violate the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the broad collection of crime reports through a public app may not be limited to what is necessary for the stated purposes.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 10 (processing criminal offense data without proper authorization/safeguards), potential violations of Articles 13-14 (transparency requirements), and Article 5 (data minimization principle)."
"IDA Forsikring Forsikringsformidling F.M.B.A. (a controller) is a Danish insurance company.

To improve the controller’s customer services, including their quality, as well, to assess the employees’ performance, the controller was recording incoming telephone calls of customer service.

The audio files with recordings were analysed and converted into a text by a data processor. For this purpose, the processor used a speech recognizing software. The software was developed by the processor for past 8 years to optimize the analysis. According to the processor, the conversation recordings were not used in order to train the software.

In order to analyse the employees’ conduct during calls with customers, the software picked up the word used by the employees. This was because the controller implemented a dedicated policy (“conversation tree”) to standardize contact with their customers. Hence, once the analysis was done, the call was assigned with a quality score. Consequently, the controller created and developed a list of positive and negative words (a dictionary) based on experience from approximately 30 million calls. However, according to the processor, the conversation recordings were not used in order to train the software.

Additionally, the analysis of call let the controller to create a statistics on number of inquiries regarding specific topics. The statistical data allowed the controller to improve the customer service (for example by updated the FAQ section). Moreover, using the statistical data the controller was able to better know the clients behaviour and accordingly adapt their marketing and customer services, for example change the content of the newsletter bearing in mind the actual interest of the customers.

The controller claimed they did not use the software to profile employees or customers, since the controller was analysing the conversation, not the individual.

Due to the subject of services provided by the controller, the conversation included various personal data of customers, inter alia, identification data, financial data, details on the insurance policy and in some cases data related to health. For the employees the basic scope of personal data processed covered name, surname, e-mail address, voice.

The abovementioned data processing attracted the attention of media. For that reason, the controller reviewed the processing activities related to the analysis of conversation. Regarding the legal basis of data processing for that purpose, the controller indicated on the consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR for the customers, and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the employees.

The Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) proceedings were started ex-officio.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves IDA Forsikring (controller) processing personal data through call recordings for customer service improvement and employee performance assessment, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller claims consent under Article 6(1)(a) as the legal basis for processing customers' data. However, consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous under Article 4(11) and Article 7. Given that the calls are part of customer service interactions, consent is unlikely to be freely given due to the inherent power imbalance, and the controller provides no evidence of valid consent mechanisms, violating the conditions for consent.

3. The processing involves special categories of personal data (e.g., health data) as defined in Article 9(1). The controller fails to identify a valid exception under Article 9(2) for processing such data, such as explicit consent or necessity for insurance purposes, thus violating the prohibition on processing special categories of data without a lawful basis.

4. For employees, the controller relies on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f). However, the processing includes continuous monitoring and performance scoring, which likely infringes on employees' fundamental rights and freedoms under Article 6(1)(f), as it is disproportionate and fails the balancing test, especially without adequate safeguards or transparency.

5. The controller uses a processor for speech-to-text conversion and analysis. Under Article 28, the controller must ensure the processor provides sufficient guarantees for GDPR compliance. The case lacks details on a data processing agreement specifying the processor's obligations, potentially violating Article 28(3) requirements.

6. The analysis involves creating a ""dictionary"" of words and quality scores, which may constitute profiling or automated decision-making affecting individuals, as per Article 4(4) and Article 22. The controller claims no profiling occurs, but the scoring system influences employee assessments and customer interactions, requiring safeguards under Article 22(2)-(3), which are not implemented.

7. Transparency obligations under Articles 13 and 14 require the controller to inform data subjects about the processing purposes, legal basis, and rights. The case shows no evidence that customers or employees were adequately informed about the call recording, analysis, or subsequent uses, violating transparency principles.

8. The processing for statistical purposes (e.g., improving FAQs and marketing) may not align with the original purposes of customer service, violating the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b), as further processing for analytics requires a compatible purpose or separate legal basis.

9. The Danish DPA's ex officio proceedings indicate suspected violations, and the controller's retrospective review of legal bases suggests inadequate compliance with accountability principles under Article 5(2) and Article 24, requiring controllers to demonstrate and maintain lawful processing.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations, including invalid legal bases for processing special categories of data, lack of transparency, insufficient processor agreements, and potential infringements of purpose limitation and automated processing safeguards."
"The controller, a foundation supporting Hungarian-speaking people living in Romania, experienced a data breach, which occurred as a result of a hacking attack that deleted personal data from the controller's server, thus affecting the availability of stored data.

The controller notified the data breach to the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a controller (a foundation supporting Hungarian-speaking people in Romania) that experienced a data breach resulting from a hacking attack which deleted personal data from their server, affecting data availability.

2. Under Article 32 of the policy (Security of processing), controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

3. The hacking attack that resulted in data deletion indicates a failure to implement adequate security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data destruction, which violates the controller's obligations under Article 32.

4. While the controller notified the data breach to the DPA as required under Article 33 (Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority), the mere occurrence of a successful hacking attack demonstrates insufficient security measures were in place.

5. The principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The data breach caused by the hacking attack constitutes a violation of this principle.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to the controller's failure to implement appropriate security measures to prevent the hacking attack and subsequent data deletion."
"mBank (the controller) entrusted a third-party to perform processing activities (a processor). The processor’s employee, erroneously, sent the controller’s clients documents to another bank. The documents contained the following personal data: name, surname, national identification number (PESEL), financial data (clients’ assets), account number, ID number.

According to the controller, the other bank sent back all the documents. The documents’ integrity was not affected, yet it was probable that the other bank’s employees read the documents. As the documents confidentiality was violated, a data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR occurred. Nevertheless, the controller was of the opinion that the risk posed by the breach was minimised by the statutory bank secrecy. Because of that, the controller didn't see a reason to notify the data subjects in accordance with Article 34 GDPR.

However, the controller notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about the data breach.

During the following proceedings, the DPA requested the controller to notify the data subjects involved about the breach under Article 34 GDPR. The controller asked the DPA to reconsider their request. The controller emphasised the documents were shared with the other bank, the controller’s business partner, which should be treated as “a trusted party”. That was because the other bank, together with the controller, were part of banking sector in Poland. As such, both the controller and the other bank pursue highly regulated business activity, in particular in the field of data protection and cybersecurity. For this reason, the breach didn’t pose “a significant risk of negative consequences for the data subjects”. In addition the other bank’s employees made a statement confirming they didn’t possess the documents’ copies and were unable the identity of the data subjects. Moreover, the other bank’s employees were aware of duties associated with the bank secrecy, as well the liability for its breach under Article 171 para 5 of the Banking law (Prawo bankowe).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 34","1. The case involves a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) GDPR, where the processor erroneously sent documents containing personal data (name, surname, national identification number, financial data, account number, ID number) to another bank, resulting in unauthorized disclosure and a breach of confidentiality.

2. The controller (mBank) notified the supervisory authority (Polish DPA) of the breach in accordance with Article 33 GDPR, which requires notification without undue delay after becoming aware of the breach.

3. However, under Article 34 GDPR, the controller must communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

4. The controller argued that the risk was minimized due to bank secrecy under Article 171(5) of the Banking Law and that the other bank is a ""trusted party,"" but Article 34 GDPR does not provide an exception for trusted parties; it requires an assessment based on the risk to data subjects.

5. The personal data involved, including national identification numbers (PESEL) and financial data, is sensitive and could lead to identity theft, fraud, or other harms, indicating a potential high risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms, as per Recital 85 GDPR.

6. The controller did not implement appropriate technical measures, such as encryption, to render the personal data unintelligible to unauthorized persons, as required under Article 34(3)(a) GDPR to exempt notification.

7. The subsequent measures, such as the other bank returning documents and employees making statements, do not fully ensure that the high risk is no longer likely, as unauthorized access may have occurred, and bank secrecy does not guarantee that data was not accessed or misused, failing to meet the exception under Article 34(3)(b) GDPR.

8. The DPA, exercising its powers under Article 58 GDPR, requested the controller to notify the data subjects, indicating that the supervisory authority determined a high risk existed, and controllers must comply with such requests under Article 58(2)(e) GDPR.

9. The controller's failure to notify the data subjects despite the DPA's request violates Article 34 GDPR, as the breach likely resulted in a high risk, and no valid exceptions applied.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Cegedim is a company providing IT products and services for healthcare professionals, inter alia, a software enabling doctors to manage patients’ data (basic identification data, as well as health history, diagnoses, prescribed medicines or procedures; and the data coming from third-parties, including HRI system, i.e. the national health identifier system).

The users of the software were offered an option to enrol for research (health-sector studies and statistics) performed by Cegedim and their business partners. In exchange for access to patients’ data, the software users received a discount on the license and access to statistics created by Cegedim.

To enable the transfer of data from the users’ software, Cegedim encrypted patient data and assigned each patient an unique identifier. The identifier informed about the category of doctor visited which made a cross-doctor data examination possible every time the patient visited a same kind of doctor, regardless its location. The patients’ data collected by Cegedim was stored for three months and then transferred to Cegedim business partners.

According to Cegedim, since the patients’ data was anonymised, the GDPR was no longer applicable to the processing at hand.

The French DPA (CNIL) initiated ex officio investigation to examine the practices of Cegedim.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves Cegedim processing patient data, including health data, which is a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, as it includes information about health history, diagnoses, and treatments.

2. Cegedim claims the data is anonymised and thus outside GDPR scope, but the use of encryption and unique identifiers that allow cross-doctor examination (e.g., by categorizing the type of doctor visited) means the data can be linked to individuals, making it pseudonymised rather than anonymised. According to Article 4(5), pseudonymised data is still personal data because it can be attributed to a specific data subject using additional information, so GDPR applies.

3. Since GDPR applies, processing health data requires a lawful basis under Article 6 and an exception under Article 9(2) for special categories. Cegedim processes data for research without explicit consent from data subjects (Article 9(2)(a)) or other applicable exceptions, as the data is obtained from doctors who may not have obtained proper consent for this secondary use, violating Article 9.

4. The offering of discounts to doctors in exchange for data access may violate the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a), as it creates an incentive for doctors to share data without adequate patient awareness or consent, and the processing is not transparent to data subjects as required by Articles 13 and 14.

5. Cegedim transfers data to business partners without ensuring appropriate safeguards, such as data processing agreements under Article 28, or lawful transfer mechanisms under Chapter V, which is noncompliant given the unlawful initial processing.

6. The storage of data for three months before transfer may not align with the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), as the necessity and purpose limitation are not clearly justified, but this is secondary to the lawfulness issues.

7. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 4(5), 5(1)(a), 6, 9, 13, 14, and 28, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"The controller experienced a data breach regarding personal data of its employees in Romania (i.e. full name, date of birth, addresses, home telephone numbers and personal e-mails). This data was accessed by an unauthorised third party.

The controller notified this data breach to the DPA pursuant to Article 33 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves a controller that experienced a personal data breach affecting employees in Romania, involving personal data including full names, dates of birth, addresses, home telephone numbers, and personal email addresses, which was accessed by an unauthorized third party (Article 4, defining ""personal data"" and ""personal data breach"").

2. The controller notified the supervisory authority (DPA) of the breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR, which requires notification without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. However, Article 34 requires that when the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The data involved (names, dates of birth, addresses, telephone numbers, and emails) can be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious purposes, indicating a high risk to the affected employees.

4. The controller did not communicate the breach to the data subjects (employees), as indicated by the case details and the verdict of NONCOMPLIANT. This violates Article 34(1), which mandates such communication when there is a high risk.

5. Additionally, Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access. The fact that an unauthorized third party accessed the data suggests a failure to implement such measures, further contributing to noncompliance.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to the controller's failure to communicate the data breach to the data subjects when required under Article 34 and potentially inadequate security measures under Article 32."
"This decision is the final result of an inquiry launched in April 2019 after Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (MPIL) notified the DPC of the personal data breach. MPIL notified the DPC that it had inadvertently stored passwords of social media users in plaintext on its internal systems without cryptographic protection or encryption.

The DPC press release shows that passwords were not made available to external parties.

The DPC had submitted a draft decision under Article 60 GDPR to the other Concerned Supervisory Authorities across the EU/EEA in June 2024 and no objections were raised by the other authorities.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33, Article 58, Article 60","1. The case involves Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (MPIL), which is a controller under GDPR as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data, including passwords of social media users (Article 4 definition of 'controller').

2. Passwords are considered personal data under GDPR because they relate to an identifiable natural person and are used for authentication purposes (Article 4 definition of 'personal data').

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Storing passwords in plaintext without cryptographic protection or encryption violates this principle, as it exposes them to potential unauthorized access.

4. Article 32(1) mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, inter alia, the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data. By storing passwords in plaintext, MPIL failed to implement such measures, which is a direct violation of this article.

5. Although MPIL notified the DPC of the breach as required under Article 33, the breach itself resulted from noncompliance with security obligations, and notification does not absolve the controller from the underlying violation.

6. The DPC, as the supervisory authority, found MPIL noncompliant due to this security failure, and no objections were raised by other Concerned Supervisory Authorities under Article 60, confirming the violation.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."
"The DPA carried out the inspections at a Scientific Hospital Care Institute (""controller"") in order to verify compliance with the provisions regarding the protection of personal data in relation to processing carried out for scientific research purposes in the medical, biomedical and epidemiological fields

Two clinical studies were analysed in terms of the following aspects: principles of lawfulness of processing,  transparency to the data subject, retention period of personal data processed, accountability, privacy by design and by default, as well as the obligation to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment, regarding the need and the ideal time to do so.

The first study was related to response and resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy and target therapy in melanoma. The second was about predicting lung disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer using artificial intelligence techniques on clinical and imaging data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 13, Article 14, Article 25, Article 35","1. The case involves a controller (Scientific Hospital Care Institute) processing personal data for scientific research purposes, which includes health data, a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the policy. Processing such data requires compliance with strict conditions under Article 9(2) for lawfulness.

2. For lawfulness of processing, Article 6 requires a valid basis, such as consent or public interest, and Article 9(2) requires explicit consent or other specific conditions for special categories. The controller must ensure that processing for research meets these conditions, such as based on Union or Member State law with safeguards under Article 9(2)(j).

3. Transparency obligations under Articles 13 and 14 require that data subjects be informed about the processing of their data. For research where data is not obtained directly from data subjects, Article 14 applies, but exemptions under Article 14(5)(b) may apply if providing information involves disproportionate effort. However, the controller must still implement measures to protect rights, such as making information publicly available.

4. The retention period of personal data must comply with Article 5(1)(e), which requires that data be kept no longer than necessary. For research, longer retention is allowed under Article 89(1) only with appropriate safeguards, such as pseudonymization, to ensure data minimization.

5. Accountability under Article 5(2) and Article 24 requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to demonstrate compliance, including data protection policies and adherence to codes of conduct.

6. Privacy by design and by default under Article 25 requires that the controller implement measures, such as pseudonymization and data minimization, at the time of processing determination and during processing itself. This is particularly important for research involving artificial intelligence, as in the second study.

7. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is required under Article 35(1) for processing likely to result in high risk to rights and freedoms. The second study, which uses artificial intelligence on clinical and imaging data, likely involves systematic and extensive evaluation under Article 35(3)(a), making a DPIA mandatory prior to processing.

8. The inspection revealed issues with the DPIA, specifically regarding ""the need and the ideal time to do so,"" indicating that the controller did not conduct a DPIA at the appropriate time or failed to recognize its necessity, violating Article 35(1) and (3).

9. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence might involve automated processing or profiling, which requires compliance with Article 22, but the primary noncompliance stems from the DPIA obligation.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to failures in conducting a timely and necessary DPIA, and potentially other aspects like transparency or accountability, as per the DPA's findings."
"Since 2018, the University of Agder (the controller) was using MS Teams and Sharepoint.

The controller’s employee found out that an open MS Teams’ folder gave all the employees and students access to documents contacting personal data. For example, four documents referred to 4,851 employees and 10,419 external persons (back to 2014) who were mentioned by name, national identity number, employee number, resignation date and organisational unit. Moreover, other documents consisted of, for example, an exam overview of 568 students or personal data of 64 Ukrainian refugees.

After receiving the notification from the employee, the controller immediately changed the access setting of the MS Teams’ folders. The new setting required each employee willing to access the folder to be approved by the folder's owner.

The controller notified about the incident under Article 33 GDPR the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) and according to Article 34 GDPR affected data subjects. Additionally, the controller published its detailed description on the controller’s website. However, the log control was limited only to 6 months back. The controller was unable to confirm if the employees and students interacted with or downloaded the data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves the University of Agder as a data controller processing personal data through MS Teams and SharePoint, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) GDPR. Specifically, the open access settings on MS Teams folders allowed unauthorized access to sensitive personal data, including national identity numbers and other personal information, without proper access controls.

3. The controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access. The open folder configuration resulted in unauthorized access to personal data by employees and students who should not have had access.

4. The controller's inability to determine whether data subjects' personal data were accessed or downloaded due to limited log controls (only 6 months of logs) demonstrates a failure to maintain adequate security measures and documentation, violating Article 32(1)(d) GDPR, which requires the ability to restore availability and access to personal data in a timely manner after an incident, and Article 30 GDPR, which requires maintaining records of processing activities.

5. The processing of special categories of personal data (e.g., national identity numbers) without implementing additional safeguards violates Article 9 GDPR, which prohibits processing such data unless specific conditions are met, and requires appropriate safeguards when processing is permitted.

6. The controller failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2) GDPR, as they could not prove that appropriate measures were in place to protect personal data or that they could assess the full scope of the breach due to insufficient logging.

7. Although the controller took remedial actions (changing access settings, notifying the DPA and data subjects, and publishing details on their website), these measures were reactive rather than proactive, indicating a failure to implement data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25 GDPR.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."
"The controller, a health authority managing several hospitals and other health facilities, experienced a cyberattack. This led to the unauthorised access to files stored in the controller's servers. These files contained personal data of both employees and patients, including medical documents and images.

The controller notified the data breach to the DPA in accordance with Article 33 GDPR and to data subjects according to Article 34 GDPR. Moreover, several data subjects filed a complaint with the DPA.

The controller argued that it was in the process of updating its IT system and improving its security measures.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34","1. The controller, a health authority, processes personal data including special categories of health data (medical documents and images) under Article 9(1) GDPR, which requires heightened protection measures due to the sensitive nature of such data.

2. Article 32(1) GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering factors like the state of the art and the nature of the data. The cyberattack and resulting unauthorized access indicate a failure to implement adequate security measures, as required by Article 32.

3. Article 5(1)(f) GDPR establishes the principle of integrity and confidentiality, requiring that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access. The breach constitutes a violation of this fundamental principle.

4. While the controller was in the process of updating its IT system, Article 24(1) GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, which must be effective at the time of processing. Ongoing improvements do not excuse prior inadequate security measures that led to the breach.

5. The processing of special category health data under Article 9 requires additional safeguards under Article 9(2). The breach demonstrates insufficient protection of this sensitive data, violating the enhanced protection requirements for special category data.

6. The controller's obligation under Article 32 includes implementing measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems (Article 32(1)(b)). The successful cyberattack indicates a failure to maintain these security standards.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to failures to implement appropriate security measures under Articles 5(1)(f) and 32, particularly given the sensitive nature of the health data involved under Article 9."
"On 6 July 2022, the Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) initiated an investigation on its own against Dansk Retursystem (a controller). The controller is an entity managing the system of cans and bottles deposits - pant. The DPA had been made aware that the controller had developed an application called ""Pant"" (the App) for the payment of deposit. In connection with the App, the controller processed a number of information about, among other things, the users' bank accounts, balances, loans, etc.

The investigation showed that the App had a built-in component allowing a user to log in their bank  to obtain the user's account information in order to pay out money to the right account. The component was made available by a third party and integrated with the App. The component could also collect information about e.g. user's balances, identity information and transaction history. However, this information was not passed on to the controller.

The DPA decided to limit the investigation of the App to the questions of:

(i) whether the controller's processing of personal data in connection with the use of the App took place in accordance with the principles for processing personal data, including the principle of legality, reasonableness and transparency in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the data minimization principle in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR; and

(ii) whether the processing took place in accordance with Article 25 (1) GDPR, as regards the implementation of the data protection principles.

Against this background, the DPA requested the controller for an opinion regarding the App. In his clarifications, the controller affirmed that they have developed the App to modernize the process of deposit payouts, transitioning from physical cards to direct bank transfers. The App required users to register and link a bank account for deposit payments. For this purpose the controller relied on services offered by Tink AB, a payment-service-provider. The controller integrated with Tink's solution to facilitate account selection securely. Tink, acting as a separate data controller initially, gathered extensive data including account numbers, balances, and transaction history, which are crucial for specifying payment details but were not retained by the controller.

To provide flexibility and address operational concerns, the controller introduced a manual option for account linking that bypasses third-party services like Tink. This manual process lacks the validation that comes with the automated system but offers an alternative for users during bank system failures or for those preferring not to use Tink.

The controller emphasized its role as a data controller once account information is received from Tink, responsible for ensuring data processing aligns with GDPR requirements. The App's design focused on minimal data collection essential for its function, avoiding unnecessary storage or processing of sensitive personal information such as addresses or social security numbers.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25","1. The case involves Dansk Retursystem as a data controller processing personal data through its ""Pant"" App, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as it involves automated processing of personal data (Article 2(1)).

2. The controller integrated a third-party component (Tink AB) to facilitate bank account linking, during which Tink (acting as a separate controller) collected extensive personal data including account numbers, balances, transaction history, and identity information (Case Facts).

3. The controller failed to ensure transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, as users were not adequately informed about Tink's involvement and the full scope of data collection during the bank-linking process, violating the requirement to provide clear information per Articles 13 and 14 when personal data are collected from the data subject or from other sources.

4. The processing violated the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, as Tink collected data (e.g., balances, transaction history) beyond what was strictly necessary for the specific purpose of deposit payouts, even though the controller claimed not to retain this data. The GDPR requires that personal data be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.""

5. The controller failed to implement data protection by design under Article 25(1) GDPR, as the App's design allowed for unnecessary data collection by Tink without implementing technical measures to limit this collection to only what was essential for the payment purpose.

6. The introduction of a manual account-linking option without proper validation mechanisms further violated Article 25(1) GDPR, as this alternative process increased the risk of inaccuracies and unauthorized disclosures, failing to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection principles were effectively applied.

7. The controller did not demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2) GDPR, as it failed to show that adequate measures were in place to ensure and prove that processing activities met GDPR requirements, particularly concerning the third-party data collection via Tink.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically with Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 5(2), 13, 14, and 25(1)."
"The controller provided remote psychic services via telephone, online chat or text message. On some of its websites, the controller offered personalized chats via telephone carried out by its partner. In order to promote their services, the two companies sent marketing messages to existing and prospective customers via e-mail and text. Prospective customers' contact details were obtained through a contact form on either of the two companies’ websites. The controller and its partner set up a shared database for their marketing purposes which on the 6 October 2022 included personal data of more than 1.5 million people.

On 15 November 2021, the French DPA (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés - CNIL) carried out an online check of five websites run by the controller and its partner. An on-site inspection was also carried out on 7 and 8 December 2021 at the premises of the two companies. The following details the findings of the investigation:

1)	Data retention period proportionate to the purpose of processing under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR

The controller retained the data of its customers for a period of six years after the end of the commercial relationship. The controller argued that this is necessary so that it would be able to respond to possible judicial investigations.

2)	Prior consent to the processing of special category data under Article 9 GDPR

The controller offers users of its website horoscope.fr to fill in a form intended to issue a free prediction about their romantic compatibility with a person of their choice. Users must enter their sex, date, time and city of birth, as well as their e-mail address, but also the sex and date of birth of their partner. During the remote consultations, a plethora of personal information may be disclosed by the customers. These conversations are recorded by the controller's partner and half of the data is stored until the end of the working day and the other half stored for a period of six months.

The controller argued that this sensitive data is not processed but simply recorded.

3)	Processing for marketing purposes under Article L.34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code (Article L.34-5 Code des postes et des communication électroniques)

The notice included on the contact form did not list the controller, nor a list of all other third parties the data is shared with. While users could follow a link which provided some additional information, this link was located much further down on the form. Further, the information included in the link did not mention commercial advertising at all.

During the proceedings the controller changed the format of the contact form to include a very small unintelligible character attached to a word on the form. A click on this character then lead to a footnote which was not visible on the original form listing the controller as the provider of marketing messages.

The controller argued that it would be impossible to provide data subjects with a comprehensive list of recipients as this would breach contractual confidentiality clauses.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9","1. The controller retains customer data for six years after the end of the commercial relationship, claiming it is necessary for judicial investigations. However, Article 5(1)(e) GDPR requires that personal data be kept no longer than necessary for the purposes of processing. Retention for such a prolonged period without a specific, ongoing purpose or legal obligation violates the storage limitation principle, as it is disproportionate and not justified by the stated purpose.

2. The controller collects special category data through a horoscope form (e.g., birth details) and records conversations during psychic services, which may include sensitive information such as health, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation. Article 9(1) GDPR prohibits processing of special category data unless a condition under Article 9(2) applies. The controller argues that this data is only recorded and not processed, but Article 4(2) defines processing to include recording, storage, and other operations. Thus, the controller is processing special category data without a lawful basis, such as explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a), which was not obtained in a valid manner.

3. For marketing purposes, the controller uses a contact form that initially did not adequately inform data subjects about the recipients of their data or the commercial advertising purpose, as required by Article 13(1)(c) and (e) GDPR. The subsequent change to include a small, unintelligible character linked to a footnote does not meet the requirement under Article 12(1) for information to be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear and plain language. The controller's argument that providing a list of recipients would breach confidentiality clauses is not valid, as GDPR transparency obligations must be fulfilled, for example by listing categories of recipients if specific names cannot be disclosed.

4. The controller and its partner maintain a shared database for marketing with over 1.5 million people's data, but the lack of proper transparency and lawful processing for special category data indicates a failure to comply with multiple GDPR principles, including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), and specific obligations for information provision under Articles 12 and 13.

Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."

The controller retained the data of its customers for a period of six years after the end of the commercial relationship.

2) Processing limited to necessary data under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR

The controller categorically recorded all telephone conversations with half of the conversations being deleted by the end of the day and the other half being stored for six years. The controller argued that this is necessary so that it would be able to respond to possible judicial investigations as well as for training and quality control purposes.

3)	Prior consent to the processing of special category data under Article 9 GDPR

The controller argued that it would be impossible to provide data subjects with a comprehensive list of recipients as this would breach contractual confidentiality clauses.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9","1. The controller retained customer data for six years after the end of the commercial relationship, which exceeds what is necessary for the purposes of processing. Article 5(1)(e) requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification for no longer than is necessary for the purposes. The retention period was disproportionate to the purpose without adequate justification, violating the storage limitation principle.

2. The controller recorded all telephone conversations and stored half of them for six years, claiming necessity for judicial investigations, training, and quality control. Article 5(1)(c) requires that processing be limited to what is necessary for the purposes (data minimisation). The blanket recording and long-term storage of all calls without differentiation between purposes or data types violates this principle, as less intrusive methods could achieve the stated goals.

3. The controller processed special category data (including details about sex, birth data, and partner information) without obtaining explicit consent. Article 9 prohibits processing of special category data unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller's claim that they merely ""recorded"" this data is irrelevant, as recording constitutes processing under Article 4(2). No valid exception under Article 9(2) was demonstrated, particularly the lack of explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a).

4. For marketing communications, the controller failed to provide transparent information about data sharing practices. The notice on the contact form did not clearly identify the controller or all third-party recipients, and critical information was hidden behind an obscure link with unintelligible formatting. This violates Article 13(1)(e), which requires clear disclosure of recipients or categories of recipients, and Article 12(1), which mandates transparent communication in an intelligible and easily accessible form using clear language.

5. The controller's argument that disclosing all recipients would breach confidentiality clauses is invalid under GDPR. Article 13(1)(e) explicitly requires disclosure of recipients, and contractual obligations cannot override this legal requirement. The failure to provide this information constitutes a violation of transparency obligations.

6. The marketing practices also violated French national law (Article L.34-5 of the Post and Electronic Communications Code) incorporated under Article 6(3) GDPR, which requires prior consent for electronic marketing communications. The inadequate notice and consent mechanism failed to meet this standard.

7. Therefore, the case demonstrates multiple violations of GDPR principles including storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c)), special category processing (Article 9), transparency (Articles 12 and 13), and lawful processing for marketing purposes (Article 6), making it NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"At an unspecified date in the past, the controller installed video cameras within its company premises. Some of the cameras were directly pointed at employees' workspaces. The cameras recorded employees at work and these recordings were accessible to the controller, the manager of the employees, via a mobile phone and also through a website.

The data subjects were not able to access the recordings. There was no clearly visible notice of the video recording in progress placed at the entrance to the workplace. The controller placed a notice on the video recording well within the premises in an obscure place.

The notice of video recording did not contain information on the consequences of the recording, the contact details of the controller, whether information was passed on to third parties nor any of the required information under Article 13(1) GDPR. Moreover, the notice lacked any link to a website where this information could then be found.

The DPA then launched an ex officio procedure against the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 83","1. The case involves a controller processing personal data of employees through video surveillance, which constitutes processing of personal data as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR, as the recordings relate to identifiable natural persons.

2. The processing must have a lawful basis under Article 6 of the GDPR. The case does not specify any lawful basis for the video surveillance, such as consent, legitimate interests, or legal obligation. Given the intrusive nature of monitoring employees' workspaces, it is unlikely that a valid lawful basis was established, especially considering the power imbalance in employment relationships, which may invalidate consent if relied upon.

3. Under Article 13 of the GDPR, when personal data is collected directly from data subjects, the controller must provide specific information at the time of collection, including the identity and contact details of the controller, the purposes of processing, the legal basis, the recipients of the data, and the rights of the data subject. The notice placed by the controller was obscure, not clearly visible at the entrance, and lacked all required information under Article 13(1) and (2), such as contact details, consequences of processing, and whether data is shared with third parties.

4. Article 12 of the GDPR requires that information provided to data subjects be concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible, using clear and plain language. Placing the notice in an obscure location within the premises fails to meet this requirement, as it does not ensure that data subjects are adequately informed at the time of data collection.

5. The employees were not able to access the recordings, which violates their right of access under Article 15 of the GDPR. Article 15 grants data subjects the right to obtain confirmation as to whether their personal data is being processed and to access that data.

6. The video surveillance, particularly when cameras are pointed directly at employees' workspaces, likely involves monitoring that could be considered high-risk processing under Article 35 of the GDPR, requiring a data protection impact assessment (DPIA). The case does not indicate that a DPIA was conducted, suggesting a violation of Article 35.

7. Based on the violations of Articles 6, 12, 13, 15, and potentially 35 of the GDPR, the controller has failed to comply with the GDPR's requirements for lawfulness, transparency, and data subject rights.

Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On March 31, 2020, INPS changed it CDN technology (Content Delivery Network is a system that uses servers located in different places to deliver web content quickly to users around the world) to handle a large number of people accessing its website at the same time, especially important during the high-demand times caused by the COVID-19 pandemic benefits.

However, during the setup, it led to caching errors that allowed unauthorized access to personal data for about 30 minutes. Instead of just showing users their own information, the system ended up showing some user's personal information to others if they visited the website during that time period. This happened because some pages that contained sensitive information were not excluded from caching.

On April 1, 2020, the new system went live, and almost immediately, it was discovered that the system allowed unauthorized access to claims applications. On the same day, INPS notified Garante regarding the CDN data breaches that occurred because of incorrect caching configurations that led to unauthorized access to personal data by displaying cached personal data to other users. This data breach involved personal details displayed on the INPS portal, such as tax codes, names, addresses, and email contacts, among other information.

On April 2, 2020, another breach happened in the context of emergency measures during the pandemic, specifically around the application process for a babysitting service bonus that began on April 1, 2020. Due to the hurried implementation and simplified access measures (like a simplified PIN system), the application procedure did not adequately differentiate between different user types. As a result, some users were wrongly granted access levels typically reserved for authorized intermediaries (like patronages), allowing them to view, modify, or submit applications that contained personal data.

On April 3, 2020, INPS published a notice about the data breach on their homepage and set up a dedicated email for breach reports to manage the situation and communicate with the public.

On April 6, 2020, INPD notified Garante regarding the second data breaches that occurred.

On May 14, 2020, Garante instructed the controller, INPD to notify affected individuals of the data breach.

On July 8, 2020, INPS completed the notification process to the data subject potentially affected by the data breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves INPS as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 4(7) and Article 2, as the processing is carried out by a public authority in the context of its activities.

2. INPS experienced two personal data breaches: the first on April 1, 2020, due to CDN caching errors that allowed unauthorized access to personal data for approximately 30 minutes, and the second on April 2, 2020, due to inadequate access controls in the babysitting service bonus application system.

3. Under Article 32, controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. INPS failed to implement adequate safeguards by not properly configuring the CDN to exclude sensitive pages from caching and by implementing simplified access measures without sufficient security differentiation, thereby violating Article 32.

4. Article 33 requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. INPS notified Garante of the first breach on April 1, 2020, which appears timely, but the second breach was notified on April 6, 2020, which may not meet the ""without undue delay"" requirement given the breach was discovered on April 2, 2020.

5. Article 34 requires controllers to communicate a personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. INPS did not notify affected data subjects until after Garante's instruction on May 14, 2020, and completed the notification only on July 8, 2020, which constitutes an undue delay given the high-risk nature of the breaches involving sensitive personal data.

6. The breaches involved unauthorized access to personal data such as tax codes, names, addresses, and email contacts, which are capable of identifying natural persons and thus qualify as personal data under Article 4(1). The exposure of such data likely resulted in a high risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms, triggering the obligation for direct communication under Article 34.

7. INPS's failure to implement appropriate security measures under Article 32 and the delayed communication to data subjects under Article 34 demonstrate noncompliance with the GDPR's requirements for protecting personal data and managing data breaches.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The controller is a subsidiary of Poste Italiane, the main post services company of Italy.

In August 2023, an unauthorised person accessed, through a ransomware cyberattack, the controller’s servers, containing data of the controller’s employees and job applicants (around 25,000 data subjects).

These files, that were afterwards published online on the dark web, contained not only the name, surname and date of birth, but also data related to the trade union membership and health of the data subjects, therefore falling into the scope of Article 9 GDPR, and related to criminal convictions and offences (Article 10 GDPR).

On 17 August 2023, the controller notified the data breach to the DPA.

On 13 October 2023, the DPA requested the controller to provide further details about the data breach, arguing that the first notification was lacking some of the elements provided for by Article 33(3) GDPR.

The controller pointed out that the data breach occurred due to two vulnerabilities in the IT system.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 33","1. The case involves a controller (a subsidiary of Poste Italiane) processing personal data of employees and job applicants, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller experienced a ransomware cyberattack that resulted in unauthorized access to personal data, including special categories of data under Article 9 (trade union membership and health data) and data related to criminal convictions and offences under Article 10, which constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Under Article 33(1), the controller is required to notify the supervisory authority (DPA) of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The controller notified the DPA on 17 August 2023, but the timeline from when the controller became aware of the breach is not specified, so compliance with the 72-hour requirement cannot be definitively assessed based on the provided information.

4. However, Article 33(3) specifies that the notification to the supervisory authority must include at least: (a) the nature of the personal data breach, including categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned; (b) the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point; (c) the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and (d) the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the breach.

5. The DPA requested further details on 13 October 2023, indicating that the initial notification was incomplete and lacked some of the elements required by Article 33(3). This demonstrates that the controller failed to provide all necessary information without undue delay, as the DPA had to follow up almost two months later.

6. Additionally, the processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9 and data related to criminal convictions under Article 10 requires specific safeguards. Article 10 mandates that processing of criminal conviction data must be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union or Member State law. The case does not indicate that such safeguards were in place, suggesting a potential violation of Article 10.

7. The breach occurred due to vulnerabilities in the IT system, indicating a failure by the controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). This is particularly critical given the sensitive nature of the data involved, which includes special categories under Article 9 and criminal data under Article 10, necessitating higher safeguards.

8. The publication of the data on the dark web further exacerbated the risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms, and the controller's failure to prevent the breach through adequate security measures constitutes a violation of the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f).

9. Therefore, based on the incomplete breach notification (violation of Article 33(3)), inadequate security measures (violation of Article 32), and lack of appropriate safeguards for processing special categories and criminal data (violations of Articles 9 and 10), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"An investigation carried out by the DPA showed that the controller had forwarded copies of the identity cards of its employees to a company providing unspecified services for it. These copies contained the data subjects' name, surname, personal identification number, address, ID card number, place of birth and picture.

Moreover, an employee of the controller took pictures of his working computer screen with a personal mobile phone. These pictures contained personal data. This employee then shared these pictures in a WhatsApp group chat. After becoming aware of this data breach, the controller notified the DPA according to Article 33 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller processing employees' personal data through identity cards containing name, surname, personal identification number, address, ID card number, place of birth, and picture (Article 4 definitions of 'personal data' and 'processing').

2. The personal identification number qualifies as sensitive data under Article 9(1) as it uniquely identifies individuals and could reveal racial/ethnic origin or other special categories when combined with other data. Processing such data requires explicit consent or one of the exceptions in Article 9(2), which the case doesn't demonstrate.

3. Forwarding identity card copies to a service provider constitutes processing personal data on behalf of the controller. Article 28 requires such processors to provide sufficient guarantees and have a binding contract outlining processing instructions and safeguards, which the case doesn't mention.

4. The employee taking pictures of computer screens containing personal data and sharing them via WhatsApp constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12). While the controller notified the DPA per Article 33, the breach itself indicates insufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure data security, violating Article 32(1).

5. The processing of employees' personal data lacks a demonstrated lawful basis under Article 6(1). The controller must have a valid reason such as consent, contract performance, or legitimate interests, but none are evident from the case details.

6. The case shows inadequate data protection by design and by default under Article 25, as employees could access and share personal data via personal devices without proper safeguards.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 9 (processing special categories without valid exception), Article 28 (insufficient processor safeguards), Article 32 (inadequate security measures), and Article 6 (lack of lawful processing basis)."
"On 14 April 2021, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) received a notification of a personal data breach registered by the controller, a telecommunications provider.

The Security Breach Assessment Report showed that approximately 13,000,000 people were affected by the data breach. The attackers downloaded a database containing the personal data of clients, former clients, suppliers and employees of the controller and published the information on a public website. The personal data included names, ID numbers, postal addresses, email addresses, mobile numbers, nationality, sex, dates of birth, bank account numbers as well as employment details of employees.

The controller stored the data in plain text without any pseudonimisation or anonymisation measures in place.

The controller argued that adequate measures were in place and that the attack could not have been prevented due to the technical expertise of the cyber attackers. Crucially the controller submitted that there is no relationship between the alleged inadequacy and the data breach as more robust measures could not have prevented the attack. Therefore, no causal link could be established between the actions of the controller and the incident. The controller firmly posited itself as a victim of an unforeseen attack and argued that every security system shows room for improvement but that Article 5(1)(f) GDPR cannot be interpreted as an obligation of a specific result.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller (telecommunications provider) processing personal data of data subjects, including clients, former clients, suppliers, and employees, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means.

2. The controller stored personal data, such as names, ID numbers, bank account numbers, and employment details, in plain text without pseudonymization or encryption, which violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access.

3. Article 32(1) GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Given the sensitivity and volume of data (affecting 13 million people), storing data in plain text without pseudonymization or encryption does not constitute appropriate measures, as it fails to protect against unauthorized processing.

4. Article 25 GDPR on data protection by design and by default requires controllers to implement measures, such as pseudonymization, to integrate data protection principles into processing activities. The controller's failure to use such measures indicates noncompliance with this article.

5. The controller argued that adequate measures were in place and that the attack was due to technical expertise, but the breach itself and the exposure of plain text data demonstrate that the measures were insufficient. GDPR imposes an obligation of result in terms of security, and the controller must demonstrate compliance under Article 5(2), which they failed to do.

6. The lack of pseudonymization or encryption directly contravenes the requirements of Articles 5(1)(f), 25, and 32, as these provisions mandate proactive security measures tailored to the risk, which were not implemented.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Based on media reports published in 2019, the Norwegian DPA became aware of the fact that the controller, a digital engagement platform provider, assumed the GDPR did not apply to its services. The controller had provided Norwegian users with widgets intended for countries where the GDPR does not apply. 

Cookies set by default, tracked users and shared the data with the controller unless users had blocked cookies through their browser settings. The DPA launched an investigation and found that the collected information was used to create interest groups and individual profiling. It further found that the controller had shared the collected data with its parent company. 

The controller denied that it carried out any profiling and called the processing “segmentation”. Further, the controller posited that as soon as it was made aware of the application of the GDPR by notification by the DPA, it erased the personal data of Norwegian users. In addition, the controller argued that the users consent was obtained through the settings the users had determined in their browser.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6","1. The controller, a digital engagement platform provider, processed personal data of Norwegian users, which falls under the territorial scope of the GDPR as per Article 3(2), since the processing activities were related to offering services to data subjects in the Union (Norway being an EEA member where GDPR applies).

2. The controller set cookies by default that tracked users and shared data without obtaining valid consent, violating Article 6(1)(a) which requires lawful processing based on consent, and Article 7 which stipulates that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The controller's argument that browser settings constituted consent is invalid, as browser settings do not meet the standard for explicit consent under GDPR.

3. The processing involved creating interest groups and individual profiling, which qualifies as profiling under Article 4(4). The controller's denial and reference to ""segmentation"" does not alter the nature of the processing, which falls under automated processing including profiling, requiring compliance with Article 22 and appropriate safeguards, which were not implemented.

4. The controller shared collected data with its parent company without a lawful basis, violating Article 6, which requires a valid legal basis for any processing, and Article 13(1)(e), which mandates informing data subjects about recipients of their personal data.

5. The controller failed to provide transparent information to users about the processing activities, as required by Article 12 and Article 13, including the purposes of processing, data sharing, and the rights of data subjects, thereby breaching the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

6. The controller's erasure of data after being notified by the DPA does not rectify the prior noncompliance, as accountability under Article 5(2) requires demonstrating compliance at the time of processing, not retrospectively.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"On May 17, 2023, the Southend-on-Sea City Council, in Essex, responded to an freedom of information (FOI) request posted on the What Do They Know (WDTK) website (a public platform which allows individuals to submit requests to public bodies within the UK and all the request and the responses from the public bodies are published on the website, making them publicly accessible).

The response included a spreadsheet that contained hidden personal data of Council employees, former employees, and associated individuals, such as agency workers. This data included contact details, employment information, salary, health data, gender, and ethnicity.

The breach was only identified on October 27, 2023, five months later, when WDTK notified the Council. At the same time, the Council notified ICO about the data breach.

The Council’s lack of awareness and preparedness for handling hidden data in Excel spreadsheets was highlighted as the primary cause. Staff had not been adequately trained in using Excel’s “Inspect Document” feature, which would have allowed them to check for hidden data before releasing the document.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves the Southend-on-Sea City Council, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) of the policy, as it determines the purposes and means of processing personal data of its employees and associated individuals.

2. The Council processed special categories of personal data, including health data, ethnic origin, and other sensitive information as defined in Article 9(1), which requires higher protection under the policy.

3. The Council failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, they did not use available Excel features like ""Inspect Document"" to identify and remove hidden personal data before disclosure.

4. The Council violated the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25(1), as they did not implement appropriate technical measures (such as document inspection tools) at the time of determining the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself.

5. The personal data breach, which involved unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, was not identified by the Council for five months, indicating a failure in their security measures and monitoring processes required under Article 32(1)(d).

6. The Council violated Article 33(1) by failing to notify the supervisory authority (ICO) of the personal data breach without undue delay and not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as they only notified upon being alerted by WDTK five months after the breach occurred.

7. The Council likely violated Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle) as they failed to process personal data in a manner that ensured appropriate security against unauthorized disclosure.

8. The case demonstrates insufficient staff training and awareness regarding data protection risks associated with document preparation and disclosure, contrary to the organizational measures required by Article 32(4) and the accountability principle in Article 5(2).

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"During an inspection carried out on 4th July, 2023, the Police and Labor Inspectorate (Ispettorato Territoriale del Lavoro) found that controller, a bar located in the city of Bologna, had installed 10 surveillance cameras (5 inside and 5 outside the premises) without any information notices informing individuals about the video surveillance.

On 12th March, 2024, the Labor Inspectorate informed the DPA that during their inspection, they found the video surveillance system had been installed without the required legal authorization, violating workers' rights laws.

The video surveillance system was operating without required warning signs informing people they were entering a monitored area. For workplace surveillance, Italian law requires prior Labor Inspectorate authorization or union agreement, which the company did not have at the time of inspection. While the company later obtained the authorization and claimed to have installed warning signs, it provided no evidence of setting up these warning signs.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13","1. The case involves a controller (the bar) processing personal data through video surveillance without providing information to data subjects as required by Article 12(1) of the policy, which mandates transparent information using clear and plain language.

2. The controller failed to provide information notices about the video surveillance system, violating Article 13(1) which requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject (through video recording), the controller must provide information including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, and other specified details at the time when personal data are obtained.

3. The video surveillance was conducted without the required legal authorization under Italian labor laws, indicating the processing lacked a proper legal basis under Article 6(1), which requires processing to be lawful under one of the specified conditions (such as consent, legitimate interests, or legal obligation).

4. The processing of personal data through video surveillance in the workplace without proper authorization or union agreement violates Article 88, which allows Member States to introduce more specific rules for processing employees' personal data, including requirements for authorization in employment contexts.

5. The absence of warning signs about the surveillance constitutes a failure to implement appropriate measures to provide information about processing, violating the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) which requires personal data to be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.

6. The controller's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirement to install warning signs (despite later obtaining authorization) violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2), which requires the controller to be responsible for and able to demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The controller, an online electronics retailer, was informed by a third party that some data subjects' account data were published online. This data included their name, surname, email, as well as information available in the customer account, such as delivery address, phone number, order history and data related to the cards with which online payments were made.

Moreover, the controller found that similar data (name, surname, phone number, ...) were published online due to a so-called ""credential stuffing"", i.e. an illegal act consisting in using stolen user-IDs and the corresponding passwords in order to get access to the data subjects' account on the controller's platform. This attack involved repeated login attempts on client accounts to place unauthorized gift card orders.

The controller notified these data breaches to the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a controller (the online electronics retailer) processing personal data of data subjects (customers) as defined in Article 4, including names, contact information, payment details, and order history, which falls under the scope of the Regulation per Article 2.

2. The controller experienced two personal data breaches: unauthorized publication of account data and unauthorized access through credential stuffing attacks, both constituting ""personal data breaches"" as defined in Article 4(12) as they involved unauthorized disclosure of and access to personal data.

3. Under Article 32(1), the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. The occurrence of credential stuffing attacks involving repeated unauthorized login attempts suggests insufficient security measures against such common attack vectors.

4. Under Article 5(1)(f), personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The publication of personal data online and successful credential stuffing attacks indicate a failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

5. Under Article 24(1), the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation. The breaches indicate a failure to implement adequate measures to protect against these specific security incidents.

6. Under Article 33(1), the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay, but this obligation does not apply if the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. The controller did notify the breaches, suggesting they recognized the risks involved.

7. However, the fact that these breaches occurred demonstrates that the controller's security measures were insufficient to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure, constituting a violation of the security obligations under Articles 5(1)(f), 24(1), and 32(1) of the Regulation.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"An individual, being a sole entrepreneur (the controller) was attacked with a ransomware software. The attackers encrypted the personal data of the controller’s customers and employees, approximately 200 people. The encrypted data consisted of, in particular, the national identification number (PESEL), name and surname, address, current account number, e-mail and phone number. Shortly after the attack, the controller restored access to the data. The identity of the attackers remained unknown.

The controller indicated that the breach happened due to a human error. Supposedly, one of the controller’s employees turned off the antivirus software. Moreover, the attackers also used the server’s vulnerability. The controller explained that a third party, responsible for the server maintenance and IT services (the processor), failed to update the server’s software for certain time. That made the vulnerability being present when the data breach took place.

The controller notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about the data breach. Due to immediate restoration of data access, the controller found the breach didn’t result in high risk to the data subjects’ rights and freedoms. Allegedly, the attackers’ only purpose was to obtain ransom from the controller in exchange for access to the data, not to access and to share the data. Initially, the controller didn’t notify the data subjects under Article 34 GDPR, because of the technical and organisational measures implemented in response to the breach. Eventually, a month following the DPA notification, the controller notified the data subject by publishing an announcement within their premises.

The DPA found no evidence that the data confidentiality was not affected by the breach. Thus, the DPA ordered the controller to notify the data subjects again. The DPA claimed the original notification was incomplete, as it was lacking, inter alia, contact data of the DPO or the description of measures applied by the controller after the breach.

Moreover, the DPA decided to initiate ex officio proceedings against the controller.

During the proceedings, the controller stated that all the employees underwent training of data protection duties prior to the breach. Moreover, the controller regularly made backups of processed data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves a sole entrepreneur acting as a data controller under GDPR (Article 4(7)), processing personal data of approximately 200 data subjects (customers and employees), including special categories of data like national identification numbers (PESEL) and financial information (current account numbers).

2. The controller experienced a ransomware attack that encrypted personal data, constituting a personal data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR as it involved unauthorized access to and alteration of personal data.

3. Under Article 33(1), the controller was required to notify the supervisory authority (Polish DPA/UODO) without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach. While the controller did notify the DPA, the subsequent handling revealed deficiencies in the breach response.

4. Regarding communication to data subjects under Article 34(1), the controller must inform data subjects without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The controller initially decided not to notify data subjects, claiming the breach didn't pose high risk due to immediate data restoration and the attackers' supposed motive being ransom rather than data access.

5. However, Article 34(3) allows supervisory authorities to require communication to data subjects if they determine high risk exists. The DPA found no evidence that data confidentiality was unaffected and ordered proper notification, indicating the controller's risk assessment was insufficient under Articles 32 and 35 requirements for appropriate security measures and data protection impact assessments.

6. The controller's eventual notification to data subjects (via premises announcement a month after DPA notification) was incomplete under Article 34(2), lacking required elements such as DPO contact details and description of measures taken, violating the requirement to provide clear and comprehensive information.

7. The breach resulted from human error (employee disabling antivirus) and a server vulnerability due to the processor's failure to update software. Under Article 28, controllers must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. The controller failed to ensure the processor maintained adequate security, violating Article 28(1) and (3).

8. While the controller mentioned employee training and regular backups, these measures proved insufficient to prevent the breach or ensure timely processor updates, failing the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the security requirements under Article 32(1)(b) and (d) (ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and resilience of processing systems).

9. The DPA's ex officio proceedings and corrective order for re-notification confirm the controller's noncompliance with multiple GDPR provisions, including breach notification obligations (Articles 33-34), processor oversight (Article 28), and general security requirements (Article 32).

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On February 10, 2023, the data subject received an unsolicited promotional call in which the caller identified himself as an employee of a sales organization operating in the telecommunications sector. He offered services for setting up contracts on behalf of various national providers and requested to schedule an appointment with the data subject and a local agent.

The data subject, who was registered in the Registro Pubblico delle Opposizioni (Public Opt-Out Register) to block telemarketing calls, had not provided consent for promotional communications. Also, the data subject independently investigated the organization behind the call and sent two emails to the local agent mentioned in the call to request information about how his data was obtained. The local agent replied denying possession of the data subject's personal data or the use of any marketing tools.

On August 18, 2023, the data subject submitted a formal complaint to the Italian DPA. He highlighted the unsolicited promotional call, lack of consent for the data processing and his registration in the Public Opt-Out Register.

On November 30, 2023, the DPA initiated an inquiry and sent an information request to the local agent, under Article 157 Italian Data Protection Code (Decreto Legislative 196/2003). The local agent responded, claiming the call was commissioned to a Tunisian market research company called Ste Nabi Call and that he had no direct involvement in contacting the data subject and did not possess his personal data.

The DPA sent a second request for clarification, asking the agent to provide details about the service agreement with Ste Nabi Call and clarify the ownership and use of the phone number which called the data subject.

In his response, the agent provided information about the agreement with Ste Nabi Call, stating it was for market research. Also, he denied knowledge of the phone number used for the promotional call.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 21, Article 58","1. The case involves an unsolicited promotional call made to a data subject registered in the Public Opt-Out Register, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. The processing lacks a lawful basis under Article 6, as the data subject had not provided consent for promotional communications and was registered in the opt-out register, meaning any processing for direct marketing purposes would require explicit consent or another valid legal basis which was not present.

3. The data subject's registration in the Public Opt-Out Register constitutes an objection to processing for direct marketing purposes under Article 21(2) and (3), which requires controllers to cease such processing immediately upon objection.

4. The local agent, as the controller under Article 4(7), failed to demonstrate compliance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as they could not establish a lawful basis for processing the data subject's personal data.

5. The controller violated Article 12(1) by not providing transparent information about the processing when requested by the data subject, instead denying possession of the data subject's personal data.

6. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR under Article 24(1), particularly regarding verification of consent and respect for opt-out registries.

7. The controller's engagement of Ste Nabi Call as a processor without ensuring proper data protection agreements and safeguards violates Article 28(1) and (3), which require processors to provide sufficient guarantees and have a binding contract in place.

8. The controller failed to conduct proper due diligence on their processor under Article 28(1), as evidenced by their inability to explain the source of the personal data or the specific processing activities conducted by Ste Nabi Call.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations including lack of lawful basis for processing, failure to respect the data subject's objections to marketing, lack of transparency, and insufficient processor management and oversight."
"On 29 December 2023, a complaint was filed with Garante against T.A. Format S.r.l., the publisher of the news platform Telerama News. The complaint highlighted the lack of information regarding data processing on the company’s website (www.trnews.it), in violation of GDPR transparency requirements.

On 16 May 2024, Garante requested the controller to provide clarifications on the complaint, in which they responded claiming that the necessary privacy information was published on the website, but may have been temporarily inaccessible due to technical issues. The website had undergone a complete structural overhaul between late 2023 and May 2024, which could have led to occasional omissions.

On 11 June 2024, Garante formally initiated an investigation, notifying the company of potential violations of Article 5(1), Article 12(1)(2), Article 13 and Article 14.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14","1. The case involves T.A. Format S.r.l. as a data controller under GDPR definitions (Article 4(7)), operating a news platform that processes personal data of website visitors.

2. The complaint identified a lack of information regarding data processing on www.trnews.it, which directly implicates the transparency principle under Article 5(1)(a) requiring processing to be ""lawful, fair and transparent in relation to the data subject.""

3. Article 12(1) requires controllers to provide information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 ""in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language."" The controller's admission that privacy information was temporarily inaccessible due to technical issues during website restructuring constitutes a violation of this accessibility requirement.

4. Article 13 mandates that when personal data is collected directly from data subjects (as would occur through website interactions), the controller must provide specific information including identity/contact details of controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, recipients, retention periods, data subject rights, and other essential details at the time of data collection.

5. The investigation found the necessary privacy information was not properly accessible on the website, meaning the controller failed to fulfill its obligations under both Article 13 (for data collected directly) and potentially Article 14 (for data not obtained directly from data subjects).

6. The controller's claim that information ""may have been temporarily inaccessible"" does not excuse non-compliance, as Article 12 requires continuous accessibility of information, and technical issues do not constitute a valid exemption under the Regulation.

7. The violation of transparency obligations (Article 5(1)(a)), combined with failures to provide required information (Articles 13-14) in an accessible manner (Article 12), establishes multiple infringements of the GDPR's fundamental transparency and information provisions.

8. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In this case the controller is Foodinho a food delivery company managing the service “Glovo” in Italy. This company is owned by Glovoapp23 SA, a Spanish holding. The DPA started its investigation following the death of one of its employees while he was delivering food.

The controller uses an online platform provided by Glovo ES (appointed as processor) to manage its employees and the deliveries. This platform allows to see a map of every place in the World where Glovo operates and the live location of each employee. The controller, by clicking on a “rider”, can view their location, the time slots in which they are available, the deliveries they performed and the track they followed.

The investigation showed that this geolocation function was active, in some cases, even outside working hours and when the app was not active. Moreover, the controller implemented a facial recognition function for identity verification purposes, provided by a processor, Jumio Corporation. According to this procedure, the data subjects (employees) needed to upload an ID card and take a selfie of themselves. After that, the data subjects were asked to take a selfie in random occasions. If they refused to do so, their possibility of getting further delivery time slots was blocked.

The controller argued that this processing was necessary to comply with Article 23 of the applicable collective agreement, stating that it’s forbidden for the employees to be replaced by a third party.

Furthermore, the investigation showed that the controller’s software allowed to rate the data subjects. The controller argued that this rating function is not active for Italy.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 14, Article 22, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32, Article 35, Article 88","1. The case involves Foodinho (controller) and its use of a platform provided by Glovo ES (processor) for managing employees, including geolocation tracking and facial recognition processing, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) since it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The controller processed geolocation data of employees (data subjects) through continuous tracking, including outside working hours and when the app was not active. This violates the principle of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)) as the processing exceeds the necessary scope for employment purposes, and data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) as continuous tracking beyond work hours is not limited to what is necessary.

3. The geolocation processing likely lacks a valid legal basis under Article 6. While employment contexts may rely on Article 6(1)(b) (contract performance) or (f) (legitimate interests), continuous tracking outside work hours cannot be justified as necessary for these bases, especially without adequate transparency and safeguards as required by Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, transparency).

4. The facial recognition processing involves biometric data for identity verification, which qualifies as special category data under Article 9(1). Processing such data is prohibited unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. The controller relied on Article 23 of a collective agreement, but this does not align with the specific exceptions in Article 9(2) (e.g., explicit consent or substantial public interest). Moreover, the processing was coercive, as refusal led to blocking work opportunities, violating the requirement for freely given consent under Article 7(4).

5. The facial recognition processing also violates Article 5(1)(a) (fairness) because it creates a power imbalance by making employment opportunities conditional on consent to biometric processing, which is not freely given as per Recital 43.

6. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects about the geolocation and facial recognition processing, as required by Articles 13 and 14. Employees were not adequately informed about the extent of tracking or the consequences of refusing facial recognition, undermining their rights under Articles 15-22 (e.g., right to access and rectification).

7. The rating system, though claimed inactive, represents a potential processing activity that could involve automated decision-making under Article 22. If activated, it would require safeguards such as human intervention, which were not mentioned, but since it was not operational, this alone does not constitute a violation. However, it highlights systemic risks in the controller's processing design.

8. The controller engaged processors (Glovo ES and Jumio Corporation) for geolocation and facial recognition processing but must ensure they provide sufficient guarantees under Article 28. The investigation did not detail these arrangements, but the violations by processors imply potential failures by the controller to meet its obligations under Article 28(1) and (3).

9. Overall, the processing activities lack compliance with core principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, and data minimization (Article 5), and involve unlawful processing of special category data (Article 9), leading to a failure to protect data subjects' rights.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Birmingham Children's Trust Community Interest Company (BCTCIC) is an organisation owned by Birmingham City Council that works independently to deliver services to the council. This case is related to the Child Protection and Review (CP&R) department which provides services to support families in the Birmingham area focused on making a positive difference to their lives. The employees of BCTCIC (CP&R) are primarily trained social workers and the department regularly processes both personal data relating to children and criminal offence data.

On 10 November 2022, a personal data breach occurred involving inappropriate information related to a data subject being included in a Child Protection Plan (CP Plan). The information was contained in a summary statement of a meeting between BCTCIC and West Midlands Police, the full statement was copied verbatim into the CP Plan which was then approved and sent to a family by the CP&R department.

The CP Plan was received and read by the recipient subsequently resulting in inappropriate access to both sensitive criminal data, specifically criminal allegations and the personal identifiers of an individual under the age of 18.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves Birmingham Children's Trust Community Interest Company (BCTCIC) processing both personal data and criminal offence data related to children, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2, as BCTCIC is a controller determining the purposes and means of processing.

2. The processing of criminal offence data is subject to specific restrictions under Article 10, which requires such processing to be carried out only under the control of official authority or when authorized by Union or Member State law with appropriate safeguards. BCTCIC, as a social work department, does not qualify as official authority under this provision, and the case does not indicate that the processing was based on such authorization or appropriate safeguards.

3. The personal data breach involved inappropriate disclosure of sensitive criminal data (criminal allegations) and personal identifiers of a minor, which constitutes a special category of data under Article 9(1) and criminal offence data under Article 10. The processing violated Article 9's general prohibition on processing special categories of data, as no exceptions under Article 9(2) were met (e.g., explicit consent, substantial public interest with safeguards).

4. The breach resulted in unauthorized access to sensitive data, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires appropriate security of personal data against unauthorized disclosure.

5. Under Article 33, the controller must notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay (within 72 hours) unless unlikely to result in risk. The breach involved criminal data and identifiers of a minor, which inherently presents high risks to rights and freedoms, yet no notification was mentioned, indicating non-compliance.

6. Article 34 requires communication of the breach to the data subject when likely to result in high risk, such as when sensitive criminal data of a minor is disclosed. The case describes the breach being read by the recipient, confirming unauthorized access, yet no communication to the data subject occurred.

7. The inclusion of inappropriate information in the Child Protection Plan without proper verification or minimization measures violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as more data than necessary was processed, and accuracy under Article 5(1)(d), as inaccurate or excessive data was included.

8. As a controller processing sensitive data, BCTCIC failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 32 to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, such as pseudonymization or encryption, and to prevent unauthorized disclosure.

9. The case does not demonstrate compliance with accountability under Article 5(2), as BCTCIC did not show measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the Regulation, such as data protection by design and by default under Article 25.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The Swedish DPA started an investigation, following a tip to local medias, stating that employees of the security company Verisure, the controller, unlawfully shared footage from cameras in private individuals´ homes between themselves.

The controller started an internal investigation and found no indication of improper sharing of personal customer information as described by the tip. Moreover, it considered that there is no evidence suggesting ongoing or current violations of the international regulations.

More specifically, the image material was available to authorised personnel in the company´s system for a specific amount of time, and was subsequently archived for a certain period of time, to be able to share images with law enforcement authorities. The controller specified that the footage is stored for exactly the needed time to comply with the purposes of the processing. Additionally, all image views require logging in with specific credentials, making it impossible to export them outside of the controller´s system.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a security company (Verisure) processing personal data in the form of video footage from cameras in private individuals' homes, which falls under the definition of personal data as per Article 4(1) of the policy, and makes Verisure a data controller under Article 4(7).

2. The policy requires under Article 5(1)(f) that personal data be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, and under Article 32 that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

3. The tip alleged that employees were unlawfully sharing footage, indicating potential unauthorized access and processing of personal data. While the controller's internal investigation found no evidence, the mere possibility of such sharing suggests insufficient technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized access among employees, violating Articles 5(1)(f) and 32.

4. Article 25 requires data protection by design and by default, meaning the controller must implement measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose are processed. The availability of footage to authorized personnel without stricter need-based access controls (e.g., limiting access to only those employees directly involved in a specific purpose) may violate this principle.

5. The controller states that all image views require logging in with credentials and cannot be exported outside the system, but this does not address internal unauthorized sharing among employees with system access, indicating a failure to implement adequate measures to prevent such breaches, as required by Articles 5(1)(f), 25, and 32.

6. The policy under Article 5(1)(c) requires data minimization, meaning personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary. Storing footage for archiving to share with law enforcement must be justified under a specific purpose and time limit, but the controller's general statement without detailed justification may indicate non-compliance with storage limitation principles.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to insufficient measures to prevent unauthorized internal processing and potential breaches of confidentiality and data minimization principles."
"A clinic, the controller, notified the Italian DPA about a personal data breach, as per Article 33 GDPR. The data breach concerned the wrongful disclosure of a form containing name, surname, date and place of birth of one couple undergoing IVF treatment to another patient. Specifically, a midwife sent an email containing this form to another IVF patient, who replied within one hour to receive an empty form. The midwife promptly requested the deletion of the mistakenly-sent form and informed the controller about what happened. The patient who mistakenly received the form confirmed the deletion of the form to the controller. The controller considered the information in the form emailed to the wrong patient to constitute sensitive data under Article 9 GDPR.

The controller argued that the violation was due to mere human error and that the midwife attended a privacy course from an external consultancy agency. Moreover, as the receiving patient notified the controller and deleted the wrongfully sent file within two hours, the effects of the data breach were limited. The controller moreover adopted the appropriate safeguards and technical measures required under Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR, which in the case at hand were not in place because the form was supposed to be empty.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves a clinic as the controller processing personal data, which includes sensitive data under Article 9 GDPR, specifically data concerning health (IVF treatment) and identifiable information (name, surname, date and place of birth).

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach where a midwife wrongfully disclosed a form containing this sensitive data to another patient via email, which constitutes unauthorized processing under Article 9(1) GDPR, as no condition for lawful processing of sensitive data (such as explicit consent) was met for this disclosure.

3. Article 5(1)(f) GDPR requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The disclosure to the wrong patient violates this principle, as it resulted from human error and lack of adequate safeguards.

4. Article 32 GDPR mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing. The controller argued that measures were in place, but the breach occurred because the form was not empty as intended, indicating a failure in operational controls and procedures, such as verification steps before sending emails containing sensitive data.

5. Although the midwife attended a privacy course, this organizational measure was insufficient to prevent the error, demonstrating that the controller did not fully address the human factor risk, as required by Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR, which includes ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of processing systems.

6. The quick deletion of the data by the receiving patient within two hours limited the impact, but Article 32 GDPR focuses on preventive measures rather than post-breach mitigation. The breach itself shows that the controller's measures were not effective in preventing unauthorized access.

7. The processing of sensitive data without a lawful basis and the failure to implement adequate security measures constitute violations of Articles 5, 9, and 32 GDPR, leading to the noncompliance verdict.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Raiffeisen Bank S.A., the controller, communicated to the Romanian DPA multiple personal data breaches.

A customer, the data subject, complained about a loan taken in its name, which started an internal investigation. Such investigation revealed that an employee of the controller unlawfully used the data subject’s personal data collected in the context of a prior application which was however withdrawn by the data subject.

Moreover, the controller’s employee withdrew cash, conducted bank transfers on behalf of several data subjects, changed contact details, operated Smart banking operations without data subjects’ consent, and, during this process, affected multiple categories of personal data.

In this context, the controller also admitted that two employees sent confidential information about a data subject’s transaction on Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp to a former employee, who subsequently shared it to the data subject’s relatives.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Raiffeisen Bank S.A. as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1), as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller's employee processed personal data without a lawful basis, as the data subject had withdrawn their application, meaning any processing beyond that point lacked valid consent or other lawful grounds under Article 6(1). This violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

3. The employee's actions included withdrawing cash, conducting bank transfers, changing contact details, and operating Smart banking without data subjects' consent, which constitutes processing beyond the original purpose without a new lawful basis, violating the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b).

4. The processing involved multiple categories of personal data, potentially including special categories under Article 9 (e.g., financial data linked to an individual), without meeting any of the conditions in Article 9(2), such as explicit consent or necessity for substantial public interest.

5. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), as evidenced by employees accessing and misusing data without authorisation, leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or disclosure.

6. The sharing of confidential transaction information via Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp to unauthorized parties (a former employee and relatives) constitutes an unauthorized disclosure of personal data, violating the confidentiality and integrity principles under Article 5(1)(f) and the security obligations under Article 32.

7. The controller did not prevent or promptly address the personal data breaches, failing to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2) and to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25, which would have required measures to limit processing to authorized personnel only.

8. The breaches affected multiple data subjects and involved systematic failures in internal controls, indicating a lack of adequate policies and training for employees, contrary to the controller's responsibility under Article 24 to implement appropriate measures to ensure compliance.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy, as multiple violations of the Regulation's principles, lawful processing requirements, and security obligations have occurred."
"GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A., the parent company of the editorial group GEDI, the controller, concluded a contract with OpenAI, with the objective of “bringing Italian-language content from GEDI's portfolio of high-quality news agencies to OpenAI users"", who ""will have access to attributed quotes, contents and links to GEDI publications, including La Repubblica and La Stampa"". This contract will last for three years and entails a remuneration that GEDI will receive upon sharing editorial content with OpenAI.

OpenAI in turn commits to use such content to allow users to do real-time research, and to have available a summary right away, comprising a hyperlink to such news.

A DPIA was conducted and transmitted to the Italian DPA stating that the data processing will happen on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, namely the legitimate interest to exercise the profession of journalist in innovatively.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 10, Article 13, Article 14, Article 58","1. The case involves GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A. as the controller processing personal data contained in editorial content and sharing it with OpenAI, a third party, under a contract for AI-driven summarization and linking services. This processing involves personal data, as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR, which includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as individuals mentioned in news articles.

2. The Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) submitted to the Italian DPA claims that the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests) for journalistic purposes. However, editorial content often includes special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR, such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, health data, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation, which are prohibited from processing unless a condition under Article 9(2) applies.

3. Article 9(2) requires specific conditions for processing special categories of personal data, such as explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) or processing necessary for reasons of substantial public interest (Article 9(2)(g)). The DPIA does not reference any Article 9(2) condition, relying solely on Article 6(1)(f), which is insufficient for processing special categories of personal data. Thus, the processing violates Article 9(1) if special categories are involved without a proper exception.

4. Even if the data does not include special categories, the sharing of personal data with OpenAI for AI summarization services may not align with the original journalistic purpose of GEDI. Article 5(1)(b) GDPR (purpose limitation) requires that personal data be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. OpenAI's use of the data for commercial AI services, which may include training models or providing summaries, could constitute a new purpose not covered by journalistic purposes, requiring a separate legal basis under Article 6, which is not adequately addressed.

5. Furthermore, Article 6(1)(f) requires a balance between the controller's legitimate interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The processing by OpenAI, as a third party, for AI services may pose risks to data subjects, such as lack of transparency, profiling, or unintended use, which could override GEDI's legitimate interests, especially without appropriate safeguards or data subject consent. The DPIA does not demonstrate this balancing test adequately, violating the requirements of Article 6(1)(f).

6. Additionally, if OpenAI is located outside the European Union (e.g., in the United States), the transfer of personal data to a third country would require compliance with Chapter V GDPR (Articles 44-49). The case does not mention any adequacy decision under Article 45 or appropriate safeguards under Article 46 (e.g., standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules) for the transfer, potentially violating data transfer rules.

7. The DPIA also fails to address information obligations under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR. Since personal data is obtained from data subjects (e.g., through news reporting), Article 13 requires informing data subjects about recipients of their data, but sharing with OpenAI may not have been communicated, violating transparency principles.

8. Based on the above, the processing described in the case does not comply with multiple provisions of the GDPR, including Article 9 for special categories, Article 5 for purpose limitation, Article 6 for lawful basis, and Chapter V for data transfers, leading to a conclusion of noncompliance.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On the 25 June 2018, the Irish DPA (Data Protection Commission - DPC) began an ex-officio investigation into the controller, a local County Council (Sligo).

The controller had installed CCTV cameras at bottle banks and in housing estates stating that they were to aid the enforcement of the Irish Litter Pollution Act 1997 and to help detect anti-social behaviour. The cameras therefore constantly filmed public and private areas This video footage was then stored by the controller. The controller could not demonstrate any records of logs regarding the data processing and it was unclear for how long the data was stored.

The cameras, as they were installed in public spaces filmed passers-by and individuals using nearby facilities such as a community centre. Some of the monitoring screens were in public spaces (such as the community centre) and could therefore be accessed by unauthorised persons. One CCTV footage monitor was not password protected while another had the capability to log all access to the system but staff had not been trained to use this function.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, Article 30","1. The controller (Sligo County Council) installed CCTV cameras that constantly filmed public and private areas, including bottle banks and housing estates, capturing footage of passers-by and individuals using nearby facilities. This processing lacks a specific, explicit purpose and is not limited to what is necessary, violating the principles of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)) and data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c)).

2. The controller stated the purposes were to enforce the Litter Pollution Act 1997 and detect anti-social behavior, but could not demonstrate a lawful basis for processing under Article 6. Processing personal data requires a valid legal basis such as consent, legal obligation, or legitimate interests, but the controller failed to establish and document this appropriately.

3. The CCTV footage may capture special categories of data (e.g., revealing racial origin or health data through visible characteristics) without meeting any exceptions under Article 9, which prohibits processing such data unless specific conditions apply (e.g., explicit consent or substantial public interest with safeguards). The controller did not demonstrate compliance with Article 9.

4. The controller failed to maintain records of processing activities as required by Article 30, which mandates documenting purposes, categories of data subjects, recipients, storage periods, and security measures. The absence of logs and unclear storage duration violates this obligation.

5. The storage period for personal data was not defined or justified, contravening the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e)), which requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes.

6. The controller did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of processing, as required by Article 32. Specifically, monitors were placed in public spaces accessible to unauthorised persons, one monitor was not password-protected, and staff were not trained to use access logging features, failing to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data.

7. The controller did not provide information to data subjects about the processing as required by Articles 13 and 14. Since individuals were filmed in public and private areas without their knowledge, the controller failed to fulfil transparency obligations, such as informing data subjects of the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, and their rights.

8. The processing of personal data related to criminal convictions or offences (e.g., anti-social behavior) must be carried out under official authority or based on EU/Member State law with appropriate safeguards (Article 10). The controller did not demonstrate that such authority or legal basis existed for the continuous filming and storage of footage.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of GDPR principles and obligations, including unlawful processing, lack of transparency, insufficient security measures, and failure to maintain records."
"After a Belgian journal published an article on the data sharing from Freedelity to other brands, the Belgian DPA started an investigation.

Freedelity, the controller, is a company offering technological means to simplify the shopping experience of consumers, by collecting and storing the personal data present in Belgian electronic ID cards. This allows to centralise the commercial information and offers from different brands to consumers, such as loyalty cards and background log information of previous purchases. The data processed is stored in a central filing system, accessible to other brands other than only the controller.

Three main points were raised in the investigation. First, the collection of personal data, more specifically identification data and contact data. Second, the sharing of such personal data. Third, the transfer of personal data stored in the central filing system to third parties.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 7, Article 24, Article 25, Article 26","1. The case involves Freedelity, a company that processes personal data from Belgian electronic ID cards, including identification and contact data, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The processing of data from electronic ID cards may include biometric data (e.g., photographs used for identification) or other sensitive information, which falls under special categories of personal data under Article 9(1). Processing such data requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or another exception, but the case does not indicate that Freedelity obtained explicit consent or met any other exception, violating Article 9.

3. Freedelity collects personal data for the purpose of centralizing commercial information and offers, such as loyalty cards and purchase history. Under Article 6, processing must have a lawful basis, such as consent. However, if consent is relied upon, it must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous under Article 4(11) and Article 7. The case suggests that consent may not be freely given if the collection of data is conditional on accessing the shopping experience, which could violate Article 7(4), as the processing might not be necessary for the contract.

4. Under Article 13, when personal data is collected directly from the data subject (as with electronic ID cards), the controller must provide information including the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data (Article 13(1)(e)). The case indicates that data is shared with other brands and transferred to third parties, but there is no mention of Freedelity providing this information to data subjects, violating Article 13.

5. The storage of personal data in a central filing system accessible to other brands may violate the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b), as the data is used for purposes beyond the initial collection (e.g., sharing with other brands) without ensuring compatibility or obtaining additional consent.

6. The collection of data from electronic ID cards may also violate the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as electronic ID cards contain more data than necessary for commercial offers (e.g., national identification numbers), and Freedelity does not demonstrate that only necessary data is collected.

7. The sharing of personal data with other brands and transfers to third parties without a lawful basis or appropriate safeguards, as required under Articles 44-49 for transfers, further contributes to non-compliance, though the case does not specify international transfers, the lack of transparency and lawful basis for any sharing is sufficient for violation.

8. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"On 16 September, Telefonica Espana, the controller, detected a data breach caused by a cyberattack. The personal data of two subsidiary companies of the controller, Movistar and O2 were affected. The personal data accessed comprised phone number, technical data from wifi connections and routers as well as account access credentials (username and password). The database which was compromised included data on more than a million customers. The database was used to manage its customers’ wifi routers (“eDomus portal”).

There had been up to 4 million access requests to the internal system of the controller per day from a single employee in Lithuania. The usual number of access requests was at 55,000 per day. This was detected on the 16 September 2022. However, the employees credentials weren’t blocked until four days later on the 20 September 2022, as they had been on holidays and only then could confirm that they were not making these requests. Subsequent to the employee’s statement, the controller investigated the incident.

Subsequent to the detection of the data breach, the controller appealed to its customers to change their passwords. The controller denied responsibility for the cyberattack as it was unforeseen. Crucially, it made the argument that the data leaked was not sensitive data or of major importance as it mainly comprised technical data. Further, the controller disputed that a landline number were personal data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves Telefonica Espana as a controller processing personal data of customers from Movistar and O2, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3, since the controller is established in the Union and processes personal data in the context of its activities.

2. The personal data affected by the breach includes phone numbers, technical data from wifi connections and routers, and account access credentials (username and password). According to Article 4, personal data is defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, and a phone number qualifies as personal data because it can identify an individual. The controller's dispute that a landline number is not personal data violates this definition.

3. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The cyberattack that led to the data breach indicates a failure to implement adequate security measures, as abnormal access requests (4 million per day from a single employee's credentials) were not prevented or detected immediately.

4. Article 32 mandates that controllers implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The delay in blocking the compromised credentials from 16 September to 20 September, despite detecting the anomaly, suggests inadequate security protocols and a failure to respond without undue delay, especially since the usual access rate was 55,000 per day.

5. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. Although the case does not specify the notification timing, the four-day delay in blocking credentials implies a potential failure to notify within the 72-hour window, as the controller waited for employee confirmation instead of taking immediate action.

6. Article 5(2) establishes the accountability principle, requiring controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with GDPR. The controller's denial of responsibility for the cyberattack contradicts this principle, as controllers must ensure and prove that appropriate measures are in place to protect personal data, regardless of unforeseen events.

7. The controller argued that the leaked data was not sensitive or of major importance, but Article 32 requires security measures based on the risk to rights and freedoms, not just the sensitivity of data. Access credentials are particularly sensitive as they can lead to further unauthorized access, and thus require heightened protection, which was not adequately implemented.

8. Therefore, based on violations of Articles 4, 5(1)(f), 5(2), 32, and 33(1), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"Clyde Valley Housing Association was established in 1996 and provides social housing to the Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire areas of Scotland. It is a registered charity that owns and manages around 4,700 properties and provides services to 3,000 homeowners.

Clyde Valley Housing Association released a new customer portal. The portal went live on 14 July 2022. On the same date, a resident logged into the portal and found that they were able to view personal information about other residents. The resident called Clyde Valley Housing Association and spoke to a customer service advisor, and told them that they could see information that they felt they shouldn’t have been able to see. The customer service advisor who received the call then failed to escalate this concern, which led to this data remaining viewable on the portal for a further 5 days until further residents reported the issue and Clyde Valley Housing Association suspended the portal.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 58","1. The case involves Clyde Valley Housing Association, which processes personal data of residents through a customer portal, making it a data controller as defined in Article 4 of the policy.

2. The policy applies to the processing of personal data by automated means (Article 2), which includes the customer portal system where residents' personal data was accessible.

3. The policy requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access (Article 5(1)(f)). The incident where a resident could view other residents' personal information constitutes unauthorized access, violating this principle.

4. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The failure to prevent unauthorized access through the portal indicates inadequate security measures.

5. Under Article 33(1), controllers must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The customer service advisor's failure to escalate the concern when first reported means the breach was not addressed within this timeframe.

6. Article 34(1) requires that when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay. The continued accessibility of personal data for 5 days after the initial report shows a failure to meet this obligation.

7. The controller must demonstrate compliance with the principles of data protection (Article 5(2)), including implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures (Article 24). The failure to have procedures in place for immediate escalation and response to data breach reports indicates a lack of adequate organizational measures.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 32, 33(1), 34(1), and 24."
"In September 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) launched two inquiries into data processing activities of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, here the controller.

In July 2017, Meta implemented a so-called “View-as” function on Facebook which allowed users to see their own Facebook page as it would appear to another user. The function included a video upload feature which created so-called “user tokens”. User tokens are coded IDs which are used to verify users and can control access to platform features as well as personal data. Users could therefore use these tokens to gain access to other accounts.

Between the 14 and 18 September 2018, third parties caused a major data breach by using the tokens to log on as other Facebook account holders. The data breach impacted approximately 29,000,000 Facebook users globally of which 3,000,000 were based in the EU/EEA.

Meta employees became aware of the data breach through an unusual increase in video uploads and removed the function shortly after.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 33","1. The case involves Meta Platforms Ireland Limited as the controller processing personal data of EU/EEA users, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3(1) since Meta has an establishment in the EU (Ireland) and processes personal data in the context of its activities.

2. The data breach incident between 14-18 September 2018 affected approximately 3,000,000 EU/EEA users, involving unauthorized access to personal data through exploitation of the ""View-as"" function's user tokens, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) (""a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data"").

3. Under Article 33(1), controllers must notify personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of them, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons. Meta employees became aware of the breach through unusual activity patterns during the breach period (14-18 September), yet the Irish DPC's inquiry was only launched in September 2018, indicating potential undue delay in notification.

4. Article 32(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems. The vulnerability in the ""View-as"" function that allowed third parties to generate user tokens and access other accounts demonstrates insufficient security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

5. Article 5(1)(f) mandates that personal data be processed in a manner ensuring appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing. The breach resulted in unauthorized access to millions of user accounts, violating this principle.

6. Article 24(1) requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR. The existence of the vulnerability in the ""View-as"" function and its exploitation indicates failure to implement such measures effectively.

7. The breach involved access to personal data on a large scale, affecting EU/EEA users, and required notification under Article 33(1) unless an exception applied. Given the scale and nature of the breach (unauthorized access to accounts), it likely posed risks to rights and freedoms of data subjects, making notification mandatory.

8. The Irish DPC's investigation and subsequent findings would assess whether Meta complied with Articles 33 (notification), 32 (security), and 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality). The verdict of NONCOMPLIANT indicates violations were found, particularly regarding timely breach notification and adequate security measures.

9. Therefore, based on the breach's nature, scale, and impact on EU/EEA users, along with the supervisory authority's verdict, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with GDPR requirements, specifically Articles 32, 33, and 5(1)(f)."
"Energya VM received several complaints from data subjects alleging they had been contacted by Nivalco, which offered energy services. The individuals making these calls had access to the customers' personal data. In response, Energya VM held a meeting with Nivalco to clarify the purpose of the calls and the discounts being offered. An internal audit revealed that most of the calls targeted customers who had canceled their agreements within the initial days of the contract. Under their contractual arrangement, Nivalco was responsible for promoting Energya VM’s services and managing a database containing the personal information of individuals and businesses for marketing purposes.

Energya VM claimed it was not involved in compiling this database and only accessed personal data when an individual entered into an agreement for energy services.

On May 9, 2023, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) initiated an investigation into alleged violations of Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. Energya VM denied responsibility for Nivalco’s data processing practices, asserting that Nivalco independently obtained and managed the personal data and autonomously decided its use. Energya also argued that its lack of access to the database prevented effective supervision. However, during its investigation, the AEPD found that Energya VM had provided Nivalco with instructions regarding the processing of personal data, undermining Energya’s claims of non-involvement. Energya VM was deemed the data controller. The contractual relationship between Energya VM and Nivalco ended on May 28, 2020.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 58","1. The case involves Energya VM and Nivalco processing personal data of individuals for marketing purposes, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing of personal data by automated means in the context of commercial activities.

2. Energya VM claimed it was not involved in Nivalco's data processing and lacked access to the database, but the AEPD investigation found that Energya VM provided instructions to Nivalco regarding the processing of personal data. This establishes Energya VM as a data controller under Article 4(7), as it determined the purposes and means of processing through its instructions to Nivalco.

3. As a controller, Energya VM had obligations under Article 5(2) (the accountability principle) to demonstrate compliance with all data protection principles, including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a). However, Energya VM failed to implement appropriate measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing was performed in accordance with GDPR, as required by Article 24(1).

4. Energya VM's contractual relationship with Nivalco involved processing of personal data for marketing purposes, making Nivalco a processor under Article 4(8). According to Article 28(1), controllers must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. Energya VM failed to ensure such guarantees or proper oversight of Nivalco's processing activities.

5. The case involves processing for marketing purposes without proper transparency and lawful basis, violating Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency) and potentially Article 6(1) (lawfulness of processing), as the data subjects complained about unsolicited contacts.

6. Energya VM's denial of responsibility contradicts the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as controllers remain responsible for processing activities carried out on their instructions, regardless of whether they directly access the data.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to Energya VM's failures as a controller to ensure proper data processing practices, demonstrate accountability, and provide sufficient guarantees for processor activities."
"Unicredit Consumer Financing, the controller, notified the DPA about a data breach in line with its obligations under Article 33 GDPR. This data breach included the name, surname, position, signature of their former employees, the data subjects.

The controller reported that the data was included in certain contractual documents and used in relationships with clients and collaborators, even after employment contracts had been terminated.

The Romanian DPA started an investigation on the matter.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 33","1. The case involves Unicredit Consumer Financing as the controller, which processed personal data of former employees (data subjects) including names, surnames, positions, and signatures, as part of contractual documents used in relationships with clients and collaborators after the termination of employment contracts (Case facts).

2. According to Article 5(1)(b) GDPR (Purpose Limitation), personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes. The continued use of former employees' data for client/collaborator relationships after termination exceeds the original employment-related purposes without a new lawful basis.

3. Under Article 6 GDPR (Lawfulness of Processing), the controller must have a valid legal basis for processing. The termination of employment contracts invalidates any previous legal basis (e.g., performance of contract), and no new basis (consent, legitimate interests, etc.) is indicated in the case for this post-employment processing.

4. The signatures constitute biometric data under Article 4(14) GDPR, which is classified as special category data under Article 9(1). Processing such data requires explicit consent or one of the specific exceptions under Article 9(2), none of which appear applicable here given the commercial context of post-employment data use.

5. Article 5(1)(e) (Storage Limitation) requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes. The continued retention and use of former employees' data after contract termination violates this principle, as the employment relationship purpose has ended.

6. The data breach notification under Article 33 confirms unauthorized processing occurred, but the underlying issue is the unlawful processing itself - maintaining and using former employees' data without legal basis after the employment relationship ended.

7. Therefore, the case demonstrates violations of multiple GDPR principles including purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), lawfulness of processing (Article 6), and special data processing rules (Article 9).

8. The Romanian DPA's investigation and the NONCOMPLIANT verdict are justified based on these violations of the GDPR's core principles and processing requirements.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"On 20 March 2023, a technical bug on the ChatGPT service caused users to view the chat history of other users instead of their own for a limited amount of time. The controller, OpenAI, publicly acknowledged the issue and confirmed that the exposed data included names, surnames, email addresses, and the last four digits and expiration dates of credit cards used for the ChatGPT Plus (the paid version of the service).

Following this data breach, the Italian DPA started an ex officio investigation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 8, Article 13, Article 14, Article 33, Article 55, Article 56","1. The case involves a data breach where OpenAI's ChatGPT service exposed users' personal data, including names, surnames, email addresses, and partial credit card information, to other users due to a technical bug on 20 March 2023 (as described in the case details).

2. Under Article 32 of the policy (Security of processing), controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access to personal data. The technical bug that allowed unauthorized access to personal data indicates a failure in OpenAI's security measures, constituting a violation of Article 32.

3. The exposed data, including names, email addresses, and payment information, qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the policy, which defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. The controller (OpenAI) is responsible for protecting this data under the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, as well as integrity and confidentiality, as per Article 5(1)(a) and (f).

4. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. While OpenAI publicly acknowledged the issue, the case does not specify if this notification was made to the Italian DPA within the required timeframe, but the DPA's ex officio investigation suggests potential inadequacies in compliance with breach notification obligations.

5. Article 34(1) mandates that controllers communicate a personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The exposure of sensitive information such as partial credit card details could lead to identity theft or financial fraud, indicating a high risk. The case does not mention direct communication to affected data subjects, suggesting a possible violation of Article 34.

6. The breach involves data related to payment information, which, combined with identifiers like names and email addresses, could be used for fraudulent activities, further emphasizing the high risk to data subjects and the need for stringent safeguards under Articles 5 and 32.

7. Based on the above, OpenAI's failure to prevent unauthorized access through adequate security measures (Article 32), potential delays or inadequacies in breach notifications (Articles 33 and 34), and the exposure of sensitive personal data demonstrate noncompliance with multiple provisions of the policy.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"KASPR runs a Chrome browser extension which allows users to get the business details of people whose LinkedIn profile they had visited. On the 28 July 2022, the French DPA (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés – CNIL) carried out a compliance check with KASPR, the controller.

The investigation showed that approximately 160 million contacts were included in the controller’s database. These entries included the surname, first name, e-mail address, telephone number, LinkedIn profile URL or other social networks, employer, company, job title, skills, professional interest, career, date of hiring and end of post, training, place of work, source of data and date of collection.

Harvesting the data from LinkedIn and storage

On LinkedIn, users can choose between four different visibility options: 1 – Only visible to me, 2 – Anyone on LinkedIn, 3 – 1st degree connections and 4 – 1st and 2nd degree connections.

The controller collected the contacts details of LinkedIn users who had made their details visible to all (Option 2) as well as those whom had limited the visibility to 1st and 2nd degree connections (Options 3&4).

Providing information

Four years after the implementation of the KASPR tool, the controller notified data subjects by sending an email which informed them of the practice and gave the option to object to the processing by clicking on a link in the email.  When data subjects filed access requests under Article 15 GDPR, the controller merely responded that their personal information was retrieved from publicly available sources.

The controller’s argument

The controller argued that the processing is based on its legitimate interest to facilitate connection between working professionals aligning with the intentions of data subjects active on LinkedIn. Further, it argued that identity verification should reasonably be expected by users of a professional networking service and that data was collected according to the selected options on LinkedIn.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 14, Article 15","1. The case involves KASPR as a data controller processing personal data of LinkedIn users, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means.

2. KASPR collected personal data including sensitive information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, and professional details from LinkedIn users who had set their visibility to ""Anyone on LinkedIn"" (Option 2) as well as those who limited visibility to ""1st and 2nd degree connections"" (Options 3 & 4). Processing data from users who limited visibility to connections violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6, as it exceeds the reasonable expectations of data subjects regarding the accessibility of their information.

3. The controller argued processing was based on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f). However, the balancing test required by this provision must consider the data subject's reasonable expectations. Collecting data from non-publicly accessible profiles (Options 3 & 4) and building a massive database (160 million records) likely overrides the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, violating the requirement that legitimate interests not override these rights.

4. For data collected indirectly from LinkedIn (not from the data subjects themselves), the controller failed to provide information in accordance with Article 14 within a reasonable period. The notification email sent four years after processing began violates Article 14(3)(a), which requires providing information within a reasonable period after obtaining the data, not exceeding one month.

5. The controller's response to access requests under Article 15 merely stated that data came from ""publicly available sources"" without providing the specific information required by Article 15(1)(a-h), including purposes of processing, categories of data, recipients, storage periods, and other essential details. This violates the right of access.

6. The email notification offered an objection mechanism, but this was provided four years too late. Article 21(1) requires that the right to object be explicitly brought to the data subject's attention at the latest at the time of first communication, which was not done here.

7. The processing involved building a large-scale database of professional information which could include special category data inferred from skills, professional interests, and other details. Such processing requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or another specific exception, which was not obtained or demonstrated here.

8. The scale of processing (160 million records) and the nature of data collected likely required a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(1) and (3)(a), given the systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale. There is no indication this was conducted.

9. The controller failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2), as they could not show that processing was lawful, fair, or transparent, particularly for data collected from non-publicly accessible profiles and the delayed notification to data subjects.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including unlawful processing basis, failure to provide timely and adequate information to data subjects, inadequate response to access requests, and likely failure to conduct required impact assessments."
"A university hospital, the controller, experienced a ransomware attack by the ""Ragnar Locker"" group. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the controller's firewall to obtain domain credentials belonging to a supplier.

Using these compromised credentials and a VPN connection, the attackers performed lateral movements (i.e. they moved sideways from device to app and so forth to explore infected networks to find vulnerabilities, escalate access privileges, and reach their ultimate target) within the network and  eventually gained access to the controller's shared file server, which, although intended only for administrative documents, contained various files including health data.

The attackers successfully exfiltrated data to servers in the Netherlands and established a backdoor Secure Shell (SSH) connection. They disabled the antivirus system and deployed executable code that spread ransom notes across workstations, though they did not encrypt the data. The controller promptly notified the DPA about the breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves a university hospital acting as a data controller processing personal data, including special category health data, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in the firewall, indicating insufficient security measures to protect against unauthorized access.

3. The controller did not implement measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services, as mandated by Article 32(1)(b). The attackers gained access to the shared file server, which contained health data, and exfiltrated it to external servers.

4. The controller failed to prevent unauthorized access to personal data, particularly special category health data, which is prohibited under Article 9(1) unless specific conditions are met. The access and exfiltration of health data occurred without lawful basis or appropriate safeguards.

5. The controller did not ensure that personal data were processed in a manner that ensured appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, as required by the principle of integrity and confidentiality in Article 5(1)(f).

6. The controller's failure to secure the network allowed lateral movements by the attackers, who disabled antivirus systems and deployed malicious code, further violating Article 32(1)(d), which requires a process for regularly testing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical measures.

7. Although the controller notified the DPA about the breach as required by Article 33(1), this does not mitigate the prior violations of security obligations under Articles 5 and 32, which are necessary to prevent such breaches from occurring.

8. The case involves processing of health data, which requires additional protections under Article 9(2)(h) and (i), but the controller did not implement suitable measures to safeguard this data, leading to unauthorized access and exfiltration.

9. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to multiple violations of security and data protection principles, specifically Articles 5(1)(f), 9, and 32."
"On 28 September 2022, the local police force of the city of La Palma submitted a report to the Spanish DPA (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos – AEPD).  The police had discovered 1,404 letters on an abandoned plot of land. The letters should have been delivered by Correo Inteligente Postal, here the controller. The letters had been sent off between February and May 2022.

On the 17 November 2022, the AEPD received another report from the police force of the Balearic islands showing that 5,354 letters were left in two different locations in the city of Palma. The police had been informed by a citizen who had sent an email to the city stating that they had found letters in the city’s river. The documentation provided by the police showed that most of the letters were closed and some had been tampered with.

After the AEPD alerted the controller of the reports, the controller stated that they had identified the responsible employees and had started disciplinary proceedings. Further, the controller stated that the letters found had not been opened and therefore the leaked data was limited to the names and addresses on the envelopes. It therefore concluded that there had been no risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

The AEPD initiated an ex-officio investigation on the 28 December 2022 assessing the measures implemented by the controller to track shipments and training provided to employees.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller (Correo Inteligente Postal) processing personal data through postal delivery services, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2, as it involves processing of personal data (names and addresses on envelopes) by automated means or as part of a filing system.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), as evidenced by the abandonment of 1,404 letters in one location and 5,354 letters in another location, which constituted unauthorized access to and disclosure of personal data.

3. The incident qualifies as a personal data breach under Article 4(12), defined as ""a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.""

4. The controller failed to notify the supervisory authority (AEPD) of the personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as required by Article 33(1), since the breaches were discovered by police and reported to the AEPD, not by the controller itself.

5. The controller's claim that there was ""no risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects"" because letters were unopened is invalid under Article 4(1), as names and addresses constitute personal data that can identify natural persons, and their exposure represents a security breach requiring notification under Article 33.

6. The controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires that personal data be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.""

7. The controller failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2), as it did not have adequate measures in place to prevent such breaches and only initiated disciplinary proceedings after being alerted by the AEPD, rather than having proactive security measures.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 32(1), and 33(1) of the Regulation."
"The controller is a company which operated a diagnostic laboratory during the Covid-19 pandemic. The managing director of this company was designated as the Data Protection Officer (DPO) for the controller. This designation was never notified to the Austrian DPA (Datenschutzbehörde – DSB).

The DSB initiated an ex-officio investigation, reviewed the register of the company and conducted an oral hearing. The controller argued that throughout the Covid-19 pandemic it was more efficient to combine the role of DPO and managing director. The company had delivered test results and in order to communicate with the public entity acting as the controller's client, it was easier to have one responsible contact person.

Further, the controller stated that the managing director showed appropriate awareness of his two roles and that there had been no risk of him neglecting his data protection duties.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 38,"1. The case involves a controller (a diagnostic laboratory company) that designated its managing director as the Data Protection Officer (DPO), which was never notified to the Austrian DPA (Article 37(7)).

2. Article 38(3) requires that the DPO ""shall not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks"" and ""shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller."" By serving as both managing director (the highest management level) and DPO, the individual cannot effectively report to or be independent from the highest management level, creating a fundamental conflict of interest.

3. Article 38(6) explicitly states that ""the controller or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties [of the DPO] do not result in a conflict of interests."" The combination of managing director (who determines purposes and means of processing) and DPO (who must monitor compliance) constitutes a clear conflict of interest, as the DPO would be monitoring their own decisions and actions.

4. The controller's argument about efficiency during the Covid-19 pandemic and having one responsible contact person does not override the mandatory requirements for DPO independence and absence of conflict of interest established in Articles 38(3) and 38(6).

5. The failure to notify the supervisory authority of the DPO designation violates Article 37(7), which requires that ""The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority.""

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to the conflict of interest in the DPO's dual role and the failure to notify the supervisory authority of the DPO designation."
"On 3 May 2023, utilising its investigative powers, the Greek DPA sent a questionnaire to 31 public authorities, including the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection (Controller), to assess the appointment and role of their DPO. The Controller failed to respond to the questionnaire on time, prompting the DPA to review its archives. It discovered no records of an appointed DPO and found that the Controller had not disclosed the DPO's contact details, as required under Article 37(1) GDPR and Article 37(7) GDPR.

The DPA summoned the Controller to an official hearing, where it admitted that no DPO had been appointed. It argued that this was due to organizational changes between ministries, resource constraints, and reliance on an external consultancy firm to assist with data protection matters. The DPA also determined that the Ministry’s website lacked any information regarding a designated DPO.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 31, Article 32, Article 37, Article 58","1. The case involves the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, which qualifies as a public authority under Article 37(1) GDPR, requiring the mandatory appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO).

2. Article 37(1) GDPR states that public authorities must designate a DPO, making this obligation unconditional for the Controller as a public authority.

3. Article 37(7) GDPR requires that the Controller publish the contact details of the DPO and communicate them to the supervisory authority (Greek DPA).

4. The Greek DPA's investigation revealed that the Controller had no appointed DPO, failed to publish DPO contact details on its website, and did not communicate such details to the DPA, violating Articles 37(1) and 37(7) GDPR.

5. The Controller's arguments (organizational changes, resource constraints, reliance on external consultancy) do not constitute valid exemptions under GDPR, as Article 37(1) imposes an absolute obligation on public authorities to appoint a DPO regardless of internal circumstances.

6. The absence of a designated DPO also impedes the Controller's compliance with other GDPR obligations, such as facilitating data subject rights under Article 38(4) and ensuring proper data protection oversight under Article 39.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Vodafone Romania S.A., the controller, notified the DPA of a personal data breach, pursuant to Article 33 GDPR.

The investigation revealed that the controller´s employees did not respect data confidentiality of their clients´ data (here the data subjects) especially with regards of clients´ name, surname, e-mail addresses, customer code, and customer address. The data breach in question referred to different situations, among which:

-	the unlawful transmission of a data subject´s invoice to a third party;

-	not hiding data subjects´ email addresses and not selecting the BCC (“Blind carbon copy”) option in email correspondence concerning changes in a client’s account manager;

-	 the transmission via WhatsApp by an employee of a screenshot containing personal data present in the employee´s application interface.

All these incidents entailed the disclosure of data and the subsequent access of employees to data subjects´ personal data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves Vodafone Romania S.A. as a data controller processing personal data of its clients, including names, email addresses, customer codes, and addresses, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The controller's employees unlawfully transmitted a data subject's invoice to a third party, which constitutes unauthorized disclosure of personal data and violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality required under Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR.

3. The failure to use the BCC option in email correspondence, resulting in the exposure of data subjects' email addresses to unauthorized recipients, demonstrates a lack of appropriate technical measures to ensure data security, contrary to the requirements of Article 32(1) of the GDPR, which mandates implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

4. The transmission of a screenshot containing personal data via WhatsApp by an employee further indicates insufficient organizational measures and staff training to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, violating Article 32(4), which requires ensuring that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller does not process data except on instructions from the controller.

5. These incidents collectively show that the controller failed to implement adequate data protection policies and measures to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure of personal data, as required by Article 24(1) and Article 25(1) of the GDPR, which emphasize the controller's responsibility to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance.

6. The breaches involve the processing of personal data without ensuring confidentiality, which is a core principle under Article 5(1)(f), and the controller did not demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

2. The controller experienced a ransomware attack resulting in unauthorized access to its IT infrastructure, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4 ('personal data breach' means a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data).

3. While the controller notified the breach to the DPA pursuant to Article 33, the investigation revealed that the breach occurred due to inadequate security measures, as a ransomware attack successfully compromised the IT infrastructure.

4. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures such as encryption, ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems, and a process for regularly testing security measures.

5. The successful ransomware attack indicates a failure to implement adequate security measures as required by Article 32, particularly regarding protection against unauthorized access (Article 32(1)(b)) and appropriate security measures given the nature of the processing (Article 32(2)).

6. Article 5(1)(f) establishes the principle of integrity and confidentiality, requiring that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

7. The ransomware attack and subsequent unauthorized access constitute a violation of both the security obligation under Article 32 and the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f).

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The DPA received a complaint against the controller Birou Gas S.L, following which the DPA requested information from the controller as part of the investigation process. Two initial requests were answered by the controller within the 10 working day deadline. However, the controller did not respond to two later requests for information, received on 1 and 2 February 2023.

The DPA initiated fine procedures on 10 April 2023 for the controller’s infringement of Article 58(1) GDPR in failing to respond to the requests for information. The controller subsequently requested suspension of the proposed fine because the person in charge of downloading the requests for information had been dismissed during this time, which was why the requests were misplaced by the controller. The controller also argued that the fine should be calculated according to the annual turnover of the company authorised by the controller to be the signatory to the contract agreed with the initial complainant.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 58, Article 83","1. The DPA (Data Protection Authority) has the power under Article 58(1)(a) GDPR to request information from the controller (Birou Gas S.L) for the performance of its tasks, which includes investigating complaints.

2. The controller failed to respond to two requests for information received on 1 and 2 February 2023, which constitutes an infringement of Article 58(1) GDPR, as the controller is obligated to provide the required information without undue delay.

3. The controller's argument for suspension due to the dismissal of the person in charge and misplacement of requests does not excuse the infringement. Under Article 5(2) GDPR (accountability principle), the controller is responsible for ensuring compliance with GDPR obligations, regardless of internal changes or staff issues. Additionally, Article 24 GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance.

4. The controller's suggestion to calculate the fine based on the annual turnover of another company is invalid. According to Article 83 GDPR, administrative fines are imposed on the controller or processor that committed the infringement, which is Birou Gas S.L. The fine should be based on the total worldwide annual turnover of Birou Gas S.L, not another entity, as per Article 83(5) GDPR.

5. The infringement of Article 58(1) GDPR is subject to administrative fines under Article 83(4)(a) GDPR, which can be up to €10 million or 2% of annual turnover, and the DPA's initiation of fine procedures is justified based on the controller's failure to respond.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to the controller's violation of Article 58(1) GDPR and the inadequacy of the provided excuses."
"The controller is an insurance company. On 5 October 2022, the controller experienced high traffic on one of its servers, namely the one hosting the client managing tool. The controller noticed that an unauthorised third party stole the login details of an insurance broker and used them to access the platform.

The controller investigated the matter and came to the conclusion that the breach at hand affected 37 data subjects, i.e. only the data subjects that were being handled by the controller’s broker whose login details were stolen.

The controller did not have a log system tracking the logins and, therefore, was not able to identify the entity of the attack. However, it deemed that the data breach was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and, thus, did not notify the DPA pursuant to Article 33(1) GDPR.

However, on 11 November 2022, it was noticed that a database containing a sample of 24315 records concerning personal data of the controller’s former clients was being sold on a Telegram group.

At the same time, the controller discovered that, due to a bug on its IT system, the third party that performed the attack could not only access the data of that specific broker’s clients, but also the data of all the other clients of the controller. This data involved name, national number, telephone number, date and place of birth, civil status and IBAN.

At this point, the controller performed a new assessment of the risks involved by the data breach, deeming that it was indeed necessary to notify both the DPA and the data subjects involved.

Therefore, the DPA opened an investigation on this matter. Moreover, some data subjects filed a complaint with the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34, Article 35","1. The controller, an insurance company, experienced a personal data breach on 5 October 2022 when an unauthorized third party stole login credentials and accessed their client management platform (Article 4(12) defines a personal data breach).

2. The controller initially assessed that only 37 data subjects were affected and deemed the breach unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms, thus not notifying the DPA pursuant to Article 33(1). However, Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify the supervisory authority of a breach unless it is ""unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.""

3. The controller's initial assessment was flawed due to inadequate security measures - specifically, the absence of a log system to track logins (Article 32(1) requires appropriate technical measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems).

4. On 11 November 2022, it was discovered that a database containing 24,315 records of former clients was being sold online, and the controller identified a system bug that allowed the attacker to access all client data, not just the broker's clients.

5. The compromised data included special categories of personal data (national number) and regular personal data (name, telephone number, date and place of birth, civil status, IBAN), which could lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other harms to data subjects.

6. The controller's failure to implement appropriate technical measures (logging system) and properly assess the breach initially constitutes a violation of Article 32(1) (security of processing) and Article 33(1) (notification of breach to supervisory authority).

7. The significant delay in notification (from 5 October to 11 November 2022) violates Article 33(1)'s requirement to notify ""without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it.""

8. The nature of the compromised data (including national numbers and financial information) and the subsequent sale on Telegram indicates the breach was likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms, triggering the requirement under Article 34(1) to communicate the breach to data subjects without undue delay.

9. Therefore, the case demonstrates multiple violations of the GDPR, including Articles 32(1), 33(1), and potentially 34(1), making the controller NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA initiated ex officio proceedings against a hospital (the controller) after receiving information that the controller had erroneously sent documents containing personal data of a patient (data subject) to another person. The documents contained, inter alia, the name, birthday, national identification number and filled-in medical questionnaires. The controller didn’t retrieve these documents from the wrong recipient.

The DPA informed the the controller about the possibility of a data breach in November 2022 and requested clarification on the matter. The controller explained in December 2022, that the incident could not be identified. The controller stated that the data subject’s medical questionnaire was not missing. Additionally, the controller informed the DPA that the data subject was notified about the incident under Article 34 GDPR. Also, the controller implemented remedial measures, i.e., a talk with the ward manager and a training for the employees. In February 2023 the controller provided the DPA upon request with its assessment that the breach only contained a low risk for the data subject .

Only in March 2024 the controller officially notified the DPA one the breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR. However he notice did not contain the information required under Article 34(2) and Article 33(3)(d) GDPR, i.e. measures to minimize its possible adverse effects of the breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves a hospital (controller) that erroneously sent documents containing sensitive personal data (including name, birthday, national identification number, and medical questionnaires) to an incorrect recipient, constituting a personal data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR.

2. The controller failed to notify the supervisory authority (DPA) of the breach without undue delay and in any case not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as required by Article 33(1) GDPR. The controller became aware of the breach in November 2022 but only provided official notification in March 2024, far exceeding the 72-hour requirement.

3. The controller's breach notification to the DPA did not contain all required information specified in Article 33(3) GDPR, particularly missing measures taken or proposed to address the breach and mitigate its possible adverse effects (Article 33(3)(d)).

4. While the controller informed the data subject about the breach under Article 34 GDPR, the failure to retrieve the erroneously sent documents from the wrong recipient demonstrates inadequate measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the breach, contrary to the accountability principle in Article 5(2) GDPR.

5. The controller's initial assessment that the breach posed only a low risk to the data subject appears inconsistent with the nature of the data disclosed (special categories under Article 9(1)), which typically requires enhanced protection and would likely result in a higher risk to rights and freedoms.

6. The controller's implementation of remedial measures (talk with ward manager and employee training) occurred only after DPA intervention and does not compensate for the fundamental failures in timely breach notification and comprehensive risk assessment.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with multiple provisions of the GDPR, specifically Articles 33(1), 33(3)(d), and the general principles of data protection under Article 5."
"In March 2024, the DPA initiated an investigation of Boliglag.dk (the controller) after receiving multiple complaints from property owners (data subjects). Upon searching for addresses or a person’s name, the website shows information on property. Results include information such as name, gender and age of present and former owners of a respective property. It also showed historical data on property sales and sales values, neighborhood information, property values, estimated property taxes and titles against the property. The data was compiled from multiple public registries.

The DPA submitted a request for comment to the controller. The controller stated, that all personal information such as name and gender would be temporarily removed from the website, while the DPA was investigating the matter. 

The controller explained that the purpose of his website is to create transparency on the Danish property market through an easy, simple and freely accessible overview of publicly available property information on a single platform. The controller stated that similar paid platforms already exist for realty professionals and argued that through these platforms realtors achieved an advantage over consumers who had no access to such information. Much of the information could also be found on other websites.

The controller maintained that the processing was within the scope of legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f)) after receiving the DPA’s guidance on access to public registers and a number of telephone conversations with the DPA. The controller believed that it's legitimate interest was not overridden by the interest or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6,"1. The case involves Boliglag.dk as a data controller processing personal data (names, gender, age of property owners) obtained from multiple public registries, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1), as the processing is carried out by automated means through a website.

2. The controller claimed reliance on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) as the legal basis for processing. However, for such processing to be lawful, the controller must demonstrate that its interests are not overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, particularly given the nature of the processed data which includes personal information about property ownership and financial details.

3. The processing involves compiling and making publicly accessible through a searchable website information that, while available in separate public registries, is aggregated in a manner that creates a comprehensive profile of individuals' property ownership history and financial circumstances. This constitutes a form of profiling under Article 4(4) and increases the potential impact on data subjects' rights and freedoms.

4. The controller failed to conduct a proper balancing test between its legitimate interests and the rights of data subjects as required by Article 6(1)(f). The convenience of having property information aggregated in one platform does not outweigh the significant privacy impacts on data subjects, particularly when the same information remains available through the original public registries with appropriate access controls.

5. The processing likely violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as making all historical property ownership information easily searchable and accessible goes beyond what is necessary for the stated purpose of creating market transparency.

6. The controller did not implement appropriate safeguards to protect data subjects' rights, such as limiting access to current rather than historical ownership information or implementing access controls, which would be required under Articles 24 and 25 concerning data protection by design and by default.

7. The processing operation, which involves large-scale processing of personal data from multiple sources to create detailed property profiles, likely required a data protection impact assessment under Article 35(1) and (3)(a), which the controller apparently did not conduct.

8. The case involves processing that could be considered to fall under the restrictions in Article 23(1), particularly regarding the protection of the data subject's rights and freedoms and the enforcement of civil law claims, given that property ownership information is often connected to financial and legal matters.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy as the controller failed to establish a valid legal basis under Article 6, violated multiple data protection principles under Article 5, and did not implement appropriate safeguards to protect data subjects' rights and freedoms."
"A controller decided to start a new website, using their own server. Within the controller’s structure, IT tasks, including the management of the website and other systems, were outsourced to another company, acting as a processor.

An error of a configuration file led to unauthorised disclosure of an old website folder. The folder contained personal data of 21.453 individuals, both clients and employees of the controller. The disclosed data consisted of name surname, birthdate, address, e-mail address, phone number, national identification number (PESEL) and encrypted website-user passwords.

The controller notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about a data breach. The controller shared with the DPA a report describing the data breach details, including IP addresses, which were used to download the data. The DPA decided to initiate ex officio proceedings against the controller and the processor.

During the proceedings, the controller provided the DPA with all the documents covering their business relation with the processor, including its post-breach statements. In one of the documents, the processor stated that the breach was a result of their employee error. The controller claimed the processor to be liable for the breach, because the erroneous sever configuration caused the breach. Furthermore, the processor didn’t monitor the server activities as expected, failing to prevent the breach.

According to the processor, they were not aware that personal data were processed within the website database. The processing contract between the parties didn’t include the personal data processed on the website. Also, the controller didn’t inform the processor that the website was used to process the personal data related to the controller’s services. Consequently, the website was treated as a typical website of information purposes. Moreover, the processor emphasised they were assigned a task of moving the old website content to the new one. However, the controller didn’t instruct the processor to verify the security of the new website and its infrastructure, nor to monitor the server activities.

At a further phase of proceedings, the controller accounted for the measures implemented to mitigate the risk of future breaches of that kind.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves a controller and a processor as defined in Article 4, where the processor is a company handling IT tasks including website management on behalf of the controller.

2. According to Article 28(3), the processing by a processor must be governed by a contract that specifies the subject-matter, duration, nature, purpose, type of personal data, and categories of data subjects. The contract between the controller and processor did not include the personal data processed on the website, violating this requirement.

3. Article 29 states that the processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor shall not process personal data except on instructions from the controller. The processor claimed they were not aware that personal data were processed within the website database, indicating the controller failed to provide proper instructions, thus violating Article 29.

4. Article 32 requires both the controller and processor to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The controller did not instruct the processor to verify the security of the new website or monitor server activities, and the processor failed to monitor server activities as expected, leading to the breach, which constitutes a violation of Article 32.

5. Article 5(2) (the accountability principle) requires the controller to be responsible for, and able to demonstrate compliance with, the data protection principles. The controller failed to ensure the processor was properly informed and managed, and could not demonstrate compliance, violating this principle.

6. Article 28(1) mandates that the controller must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate measures. The controller's failure to specify the processing of personal data in the contract and to provide necessary instructions means the processor could not provide sufficient guarantees, violating Article 28(1).

7. The processor's admission that the breach resulted from their employee error and lack of monitoring further indicates a failure to implement required security measures under Article 32, for which both parties share responsibility, but the controller bears ultimate accountability under Article 5(2).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to multiple violations of Articles 28, 29, 32, and the accountability principle in Article 5(2)."
"In 2022, the French DPA (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés – CNIL) received complaints about the operators of a real-estate company (the controller) filed by employees of the company. The complaints related to monitoring procedures implemented by the company. The complaints lacked concrete evidence of violations of the GDPR so the CNIL started an investigation.

Investigation

The CNIL found that the company was consistently recording its employees by capturing both image and sound via two cameras which monitored workspace but also recreational spaces. The live footage could be viewed via a mobile phone app on the supervisor’s phone. The controller had put up a sign with a camera pictogram with the words “video-monitored space” on one of the doors. No other information had been supplied to employees.

The controller also implemented a software used when employees worked from home. This software counted working hours and discerned inactivity periods. This meant that the system would register inactivity anytime an employee had not hit the keyboard or used the mouse in more than 3 to 15 minutes. These inactivity periods were registered and if employees failed to compensate for the “time lost”, they were subject to pay deductions.

Additionally, the software recorded whether employees visited “productive” or “unproductive” websites, which were determined as such by the controller. Every 3 to 15 minutes, the software took screenshots of the employees’ screens.

The controller allowed shared access to the administrator account of the software meaning that it was impossible to track who had used the admin account. The admin account had extensive viewing rights and could therefore access large amounts of personal data.

Controller arguments

The controller brought forward that employees could also manually track their working time instead without any negative consequences. It explained that it had orally informed the employees of the functioning of the software. Further, it detailed that it only used the software for two and a half months and then uninstalled it.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32, Article 35","1. The case involves a controller (the real-estate company) processing personal data of its employees through video/audio monitoring and software tracking, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (processing by automated means).

2. The controller failed to provide adequate information to data subjects (employees) about the processing activities. Under Article 13, when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide detailed information including purposes, legal basis, recipients, retention periods, and data subject rights. The controller only placed a generic sign about video monitoring and provided oral explanations about the software, which is insufficient under Article 13's requirement for transparent, written information.

3. For the video surveillance covering both workspaces and recreational spaces with audio recording:
   - The processing lacks a valid legal basis under Article 6. Monitoring recreational spaces and capturing audio likely exceeds legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) and violates the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)).
   - Audio recording may process special categories of data (e.g., conversations revealing religious beliefs, health data) without meeting any exception under Article 9.

4. For the employee monitoring software:
   - The continuous keyboard/mouse monitoring, screenshot capture every 3-15 minutes, and website categorization constitute disproportionate processing that violates the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)) and purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)).
   - The pay deductions based on inactivity periods imply automated decision-making producing legal effects, which requires safeguards under Article 22. These were not implemented.

5. The shared administrator account with untracked access violated security obligations under Article 32, as it failed to ensure ongoing confidentiality and integrity of processing systems.

6. The controller failed to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (Article 35) for high-risk processing activities like systematic monitoring of employees and large-scale processing of special categories of data.

7. The controller’s argument about oral notifications and temporary use of software does not mitigate the violations, as GDPR obligations apply regardless of duration, and oral information does not meet the transparency requirements of Articles 12-13.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR."
"The Italian supervisory authority investigated the cookie practices of an ecommerce website of its own volition. The website belongs to the Aosom Italy S.r.l. (the data controller).

The authority accessed the website and examined the cookie banner. The banner included the following buttons: an “Accept” button; a “Reject” button; a “Cookie Notice” button linking to the website’s cookie notice; and a “Disable Cookies” button linking to an explanation of how to disable cookies via browser settings.

The banner stated that the website used first and third-party cookies for several purposes, including providing targeted advertising. The banner also stated that visitors were able to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or set  granular preferences for specific types of cookies. However, the banner offered no option to set granular cookie preferences. The cookie notice linked in the banner included references to outdated cookie guidelines from the Italian supervisory authority and to a repealed Article of Italian law (Art. 13 d. lgs. 196/2003).

In a preliminary view, the banner did not provide visitors with a mechanism to express a free, specific, and granular choice with regards to cookies. The authority also held that the banner did not provide transparent enough information about the use of cookies. Finally, the authority held that the website’s cookie practices were not in line with the authority’s guidelines on cookies. Overall, the above amounted to a violation of the authority held that the data controller violated Articles 4(11), 5, 7, 12, 13, 24, and 25 GDPR as well as Article 22 of the Italian ""Privacy Code"" (d. lgs. 196/2003).

The authority communicated its preliminary views to the data controller. The data controller then took steps to mitigate the authority's concerns. The controller added a “Modify” button that allowed visitors to set preferences for specific types of cookies. The controller also updated the legal references found in the cookie policy. Finally, the controller erased all personal data collected via cookies before it changed the cookie banner.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25","1. The case involves Aosom Italy S.r.l. as a data controller processing personal data through cookies on its ecommerce website, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2 (processing by automated means).

2. The initial cookie banner provided an ""Accept"" button and a ""Reject"" button but no mechanism to set granular preferences for specific types of cookies, despite stating that such granular control was available. This violates Article 4(11) which defines consent as requiring a ""clear affirmative action"" for ""specific"" purposes, and Article 7(1) which requires controllers to be able to demonstrate that valid consent was obtained.

3. The banner's statement about granular control options that were not actually provided constitutes non-transparent information about processing purposes, violating Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness, fairness and transparency) and Article 12(1) which requires information to be provided in a ""concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""

4. The cookie notice contained references to outdated guidelines and repealed legislation, providing incorrect information about the legal basis for processing, which violates Article 13(1) requiring accurate information about the legal basis for processing and Article 12(1) requiring transparent communication.

5. The lack of proper consent mechanisms and transparent information demonstrates a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, violating Article 24(1) (accountability principle) and Article 25(1) (data protection by design and by default requirements).

6. The use of cookies for targeted advertising without proper granular consent specifically violates Article 7(4) which states that consent is not freely given when the performance of a contract is conditional on consent to processing that is not necessary for that contract.

7. The controller's subsequent implementation of a ""Modify"" button for granular preferences and updating of legal references shows that the initial implementation was insufficient to meet GDPR requirements, confirming the noncompliance.

8. The violations of multiple GDPR principles and articles (Articles 4(11), 5, 7, 12, 13, 24, and 25) in combination with the violation of Article 22 of the Italian Privacy Code (which implements GDPR provisions in national law) constitute a comprehensive failure to comply with data protection requirements.

"The Dutch DPA (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens – AP) investigated the controller, a company called ""Coolblue"" which runs an online shop, in October and November 2019. Specifically the AP looked at whether the controller’s website and the connected tracking complied with the GDPR.

The AP found that the cookie banner implemented by the controller simply informed visitors on the fact that if they continue to interact with the website, their consent to tracking is assumed. The controller had also placed a link in the cookie banner, which lead to an information page on the placed cookies.

The AP sent a letter to the controller on the 29 November 2019 ordering it to take step to adjust its cookie banner. On the 28 April 2020 the AP again checked the website and found that the controller had made no adjustments. The controller did not comply with the adjustment order until the 17 June 2020.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves a controller (Coolblue) processing personal data through tracking technologies on its website, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means in the context of an online service.

2. The controller implemented a cookie banner that assumed consent through continued interaction with the website, rather than obtaining explicit consent through a clear affirmative action. This violates Article 4(11), which defines consent as ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""

3. The controller's practice of obtaining consent through continued browsing does not meet the conditions for valid consent under Article 7(1), which requires that the controller be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing. Implied consent through continued use does not constitute a clear affirmative action.

4. The controller failed to provide transparent information about the processing activities, as required by Article 13. While a link to additional information was provided, the initial presentation in the cookie banner did not meet the standards of being ""concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible"" using ""clear and plain language.""

5. The Dutch DPA (supervisory authority) investigated and issued an order to adjust the cookie banner pursuant to its corrective powers under Article 58(2). The controller's failure to comply with this order until June 2020, despite the November 2019 directive and April 2020 verification, constitutes a violation of Article 58(2), which requires controllers to comply with supervisory authority orders.

6. The controller's actions demonstrate non-compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller failed to implement appropriate measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, including lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in processing.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The Region of Molise (the controller) used an information system to handle electronic health records and make them available to citizens. The controller relied on a number of processors and sub-processors, including IT services company Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.a., the developer of the system (the sub-processor).

Data processing agreements were in place between controllers, processors, and sub-processors. These agreements included provisions on security measures for processing personal data. In particular, the agreement between the controller and Società Molise Dati S.p.a. (the processor) provided for the limitation of account privileges on a need-to-know basis.

A user logged into the records system with his patient-level account. He was then able to access files of other patients by changing the url address of the page. He accessed personal data such as personal details and addresses as well as medical records and other sensitive, health-related data.

The user informed the controller of the vulnerability. The vulnerability was immediately addressed by limiting access privileges for patient-level accounts. At the request of the controller, the processor assessed the software for similar vulnerabilities.

The controller notified the Italian authority of the data breach. Based on system logs, the controller found that only seven files were accessed without authorization.

The controller held that the breach did not result in a high risk for the data subjects and decided not to inform them of the breach. In this regard, the controller considered that the user who breached the data, reported the vulnerability himself and intended no harm to the data subjects. The authority did not challenge this view.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves a data breach where unauthorized access to personal data occurred due to a vulnerability in the system, specifically through URL manipulation, allowing a user to access other patients' files containing personal details, medical records, and other sensitive health-related data (Article 4, defining ""personal data breach"" and ""special categories of personal data"" under Article 9).

2. The controller (Region of Molise) notified the supervisory authority of the breach as required by Article 33(1), which mandates notification without undue delay and within 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach. However, the controller decided not to communicate the breach to the data subjects under Article 34(1), arguing that there was no high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. Article 34(1) requires communication of a personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. The controller's assessment that there was no high risk was based on the fact that the user reported the vulnerability and intended no harm. However, the policy does not allow the intent of the perpetrator to diminish the risk assessment; rather, it focuses on the nature of the data and the potential consequences (Recital 85, which states that a breach may result in physical, material, or non-material damage, and Article 34(3) criteria).

4. The data breached included special categories of personal data (health data) under Article 9(1), which is subject to stricter protection due to its sensitive nature. The unauthorized access to such data inherently carries a high risk of adverse effects on data subjects, such as discrimination, identity theft, or psychological harm, regardless of the user's intentions (Recital 75).

5. The controller's reliance on the user's self-reporting and lack of malicious intent does not eliminate the risk, as the breach exposed sensitive information to an unauthorized party, and the vulnerability could have been exploited by others before being addressed. Article 34(1) requires communication unless one of the exceptions in Article 34(3) applies, such as the use of encryption or measures ensuring the risk is no longer likely. None of these exceptions are met here, as there was no mention of encryption or irreversible protection measures applied to the data.

6. Additionally, the breach resulted from insufficient access controls, as patient-level accounts could access other records by URL manipulation, indicating a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 32(1) (e.g., ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of processing systems). This violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f).

7. The processor (Società Molise Dati S.p.a.) and sub-processor (Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.a.) were involved, and while data processing agreements were in place, the breach suggests inadequate security measures, potentially violating Article 28(3) requirements for processors to implement measures ensuring a level of security appropriate to the risk.

8. Therefore, the controller's failure to communicate the breach to data subjects, despite the high risk posed by the exposure of sensitive health data, constitutes a violation of Article 34(1). The supervisory authority's lack of challenge does not absolve the controller of this obligation, as Article 34(4) allows the authority to require communication if it disagrees with the risk assessment, but the primary responsibility lies with the controller.

9. Thus, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 34(1), 32(1), and 5(1)(f), and the inadequate handling of the breach involving special category data under Article 9."
"A hospital (a controller) notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about a data breach. The data breach amounted to loss or theft of two CCTV memory cards. The CCTV covered the area of two rooms located within the neonatal ward. The breach affected 190 individuals, including controller’s employees, patients and their guardians. Additionally, shortly after the breach notification, an article describing the controller unlawful processing of the CCTV data was published.

The DPA decided to initiate ex officio proceedings against the controller.

During the proceedings, the controller explained they used wall clocks, equipped with a CCTV to protect health and safety of newborns. The controller claimed there was an increased number of infections on the neonatal ward. Because preventive measures implemented prior to the CCTV were insufficient, the controller decided to rely on the CCTV. The personal data collected by the CCTV were processed under Article 23a(1)(2) of law on medical service activities (ustawa o działalności leczniczej) and Article 22 note 1 of the labour code (kodeks pracy) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR too. The CCTV records were stored for no longer then 30 days. Moreover, the controller emphasised that QR codes with privacy notices and sticker informing about the CCTV were placed within their premises.

Regarding the data breach, the controller clarified that stolen memory cards served as the only storage of the recordings and the controller didn’t possess any backups. After the breach, the controller organised few meetings with their employees and notified data subject about the breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 25, Article 32","1. The controller (hospital) processed CCTV footage from a neonatal ward, which likely captures special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR (including health data of newborns and possibly biometric data), as the area monitored involves medical treatment and care activities.

2. The controller attempted to rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests) and national laws, but failed to identify a valid exception under Article 9(2) GDPR for processing special category data. Processing health-related data through CCTV surveillance in a medical setting requires explicit consent or one of the specific exceptions under Article 9(2), which were not properly established or documented by the controller.

3. The controller violated the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR by implementing CCTV surveillance in sensitive neonatal care areas without demonstrating that less intrusive measures were insufficient to address infection control concerns, and without conducting a proper data protection impact assessment as required under Article 35(1) GDPR for high-risk processing operations.

4. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk under Article 32(1) GDPR, as evidenced by the theft of memory cards that served as the sole storage medium without backup copies, and the lack of encryption or pseudonymization measures for particularly sensitive data.

5. The controller did not fulfill all transparency obligations under Articles 12-14 GDPR, as mere QR codes and stickers may not constitute ""clear and plain language"" information required for data subjects, particularly for vulnerable individuals in a healthcare setting.

6. The data breach notification to affected individuals under Article 34 GDPR may have been insufficient, as the loss of unencrypted CCTV footage containing special category data likely constituted a ""high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons"" requiring direct communication to data subjects.

7. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The Region of Molise (the data controller) used an information system to handle electronic health records. In order to develop and operate the system, the controller relied on a number of processors and sub-processors, including Società Molise Dati S.p.a. (the processor), a company entirely owned by the controller. In turn, the processor itself relied on several sub-processors, including Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.a. (the sub-processor).

Data processing agreements were in place between controllers, processors, and sub-processors. These agreements provided for certain security measures. In particular, the agreement between the controller and the processor provided for the limitation of account privileges on a need-to-know basis.

A user logged into the records system with his patient-level account. He was then able to access files of other patients by changing the url address of the page. He accessed personal data such as personal details and addresses as well as medical records and other sensitive, health-related data.

The user informed the controller of the vulnerability. With the assistance of the processor and sub-processor, the controller limited access privileges for patient-level accounts. Additionally, the software was assessed for similar vulnerabilities.

The controller notified the Italian authority of the data breach. Based on system logs, the controller claimed that the data of seven people were accessed without authorization.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the processing of personal data, including sensitive health data, by the Region of Molise (controller) through an information system for electronic health records, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2.

2. The controller engaged processors (Società Molise Dati S.p.a.) and sub-processors (Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.a.) for data processing operations, requiring compliance with Article 28 on processor obligations, including implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. The vulnerability allowing a user to access other patients' data by URL manipulation indicates a failure in these security measures.

4. Article 5(1)(f) mandates that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access. The breach resulted in unauthorized access to sensitive health data, violating this principle.

5. The data accessed included special categories of personal data (health data) under Article 9, which requires stricter protection. The breach exposed this sensitive information, further highlighting the security failure.

6. Article 28(3) requires that processing by a processor be governed by a contract that stipulates the processor implements appropriate security measures under Article 32. Although contracts were in place, the existence of the vulnerability suggests these measures were insufficient or not properly implemented.

7. Article 24(1) imposes accountability on the controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance. The breach indicates a failure in the controller's duty to ensure effective security measures across the processing chain.

8. The controller notified the supervisory authority of the breach as required by Article 33, but the breach itself and the exposure of sensitive data demonstrate noncompliance with the core obligations of data security and protection.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the Regulation due to failures in implementing appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, as required by Articles 5(1)(f), 24(1), 28(3), and 32(1)."
"The Region of Molise (the data controller) used an information system to handle electronic health records and make them available to citizens. This processing of personal data involved several processors and subprocessors, including telecom TIM S.p.a. and TIM’s sub-processor Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.a. (the sub-processor).

A user logged into the records system with his patient-level account. He was then able to access files of other users by changing the url address of the page. He accessed personal data such as personal details and addresses, including sensitive data such as medical records.

The user informed the controller of the vulnerability. The vulnerability was immediately addressed by limiting access privileges for patient-level accounts. At the request of the controller, the processor assessed the software for similar vulnerabilities.

The controller notified the Italian authority of the data breach. Based on system logs, the controller claimed that the data of seven people were accessed without authorization.

The sub-processor pointed out that its subcontracting agreement with TIM S.p.a. did not cover vulnerability assessments. On this basis, the sub-processor argued that it was under no obligation to assess the security of its software.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the Region of Molise as the data controller and TIM S.p.a. as a processor, with Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.a. as a sub-processor, processing personal and sensitive health data, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 9 (processing of special categories of personal data).

2. A personal data breach occurred where a user accessed unauthorized personal data, including sensitive health data, by manipulating the URL, leading to unauthorized disclosure and access. This constitutes a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) ('personal data breach' means a breach of security leading to unauthorized access to personal data).

3. Article 32(1) requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The vulnerability that allowed URL manipulation to access other users' data indicates a failure to implement proper access controls and security measures, violating Article 32(1).

4. Article 28(3) mandates that processing by a processor must be governed by a contract that stipulates the processor takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32. The sub-processor's argument that its agreement with TIM S.p.a. did not cover vulnerability assessments suggests that security obligations under Article 32 were not contractually imposed, indicating a violation of Article 28(3) by the processor TIM S.p.a. and ultimately the controller for not ensuring sufficient guarantees.

5. Article 28(4) requires that when a processor engages another processor, the same data protection obligations must be imposed on the sub-processor through a contract. If TIM S.p.a. did not impose Article 32 obligations on Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.a., this constitutes a violation of Article 28(4).

6. Article 24(1) states that the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR. The controller's failure to ensure that all processors and sub-processors had adequate security measures in place, as evidenced by the breach, violates Article 24(1).

7. Although the controller notified the supervisory authority of the breach as required by Article 33(1), the breach itself and the lack of robust security measures demonstrate non-compliance with GDPR principles, particularly the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to violations of Article 32, Article 28, and Article 24."
"The controller (Capital Area Health Care Centre) runs multiple health centers. Following findings from procedures against another organisation, the DPA initiated an ex-officio investigation against the controller's processing of personal data in joined medical record systems maintained pursuant to national law (the Medical Records Act).

The DPA found, that the controller had entered into record sharing agreements with roughly a dozen parties (including other health service providers but also e.g. the Icelandic Football Association or Transport Authority) making available the records of ca. 450,000 individuals in one joint medical record system to which healthcare professionals working on behalf of the contracting parties had access. Such sharing agreements require a licensing both by the DPA and the responsible Ministry under the Medical Records Act.

The DPA's investigation revealed, that the controller had only undergone one such licensing process regarding the sharing only with one party. In this licensing process the DPA had considered the sharing necessary for the public interest consisting in better ensuring patient safety, pursuant to the Medical Records Act and Articles 6(1)(e) and 9(2)(h) GDPR. The Controller stated that the other agreements in substance were based  on that agreement, despite the fact that they did not undergo a formal licensing process. The controller acknowledged that there were shortcomings in the handling of those agreements.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9","1. The controller (Capital Area Health Care Centre) processes personal data, including special categories of health data, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 4 (definitions of 'personal data' and 'processing') and Article 9 (processing of special categories of personal data).

2. The processing of health data requires compliance with stricter conditions under GDPR. Article 9(1) prohibits processing of health data unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies. In this case, the controller relied on Article 9(2)(h) for processing necessary for preventive or occupational medicine, medical diagnosis, provision of health care, etc., which must be based on Union or Member State law.

3. The Medical Records Act is the relevant national law that provides the legal basis for processing under Article 6(1)(e) (processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest) and Article 9(2)(h). However, this law requires a specific licensing process by both the DPA and the Ministry for record sharing agreements.

4. The controller only obtained proper licensing for one sharing agreement, as acknowledged by the DPA. The other agreements with roughly a dozen parties did not undergo the required formal licensing process under the Medical Records Act.

5. Without the required licensing, the processing lacks a valid legal basis under Article 6(1)(e) and fails to meet the exception under Article 9(2)(h), as the processing is not carried out in accordance with the Member State law that provides suitable safeguards.

6. The controller's failure to obtain proper licensing for the majority of sharing agreements means the processing violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), which requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.

7. Additionally, the controller's actions likely violate the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), as unauthorized sharing of medical records without proper safeguards increases the risk of unauthorized access or disclosure.

8. The controller acknowledged shortcomings in handling the agreements, further confirming the noncompliance with the required legal procedures under national law and consequently with GDPR's requirements for lawful processing of sensitive data.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to the lack of a valid legal basis for processing health data and failure to adhere to the principles of lawfulness and proper safeguards as required by Articles 5, 6, and 9."
"In September 2018, a Maynooth University (data controller) staff member’s email address was compromised while they were in the process of handling a financial payment, and email “rules” set up to hide future received emails from the victim. This allowed the attacker to trick a University staff member into transferring a sum of money to a fraudulent account, believing it to be being paid into their pension pot. The email addresses of five other staff members were also compromised.

In October 2018, the victim of the financial fraud became aware of what had happened and reported it to the controller. The controller responded by resetting the user’s password and hiring an external cybersecurity firm to investigate the incident. The incident was not reported to the data protection authority (Data Protection Commission (DPC)) until November 2018, the following month. The controller's DPO reported the incident to the DPC within 72 hours of being notified by the controller. The controller had delayed alerting the DPO to conduct an external investigation instead.

The University identified that the personal data of 653 data subjects (of which it was possible to identify 463), consisting of their identity, personal public services number (PPSN), contact details, economic/financial data and location data was breached.

On the 7th November 2019, the DPC initiated an inquiry into the incident.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves Maynooth University as a data controller processing personal data, including special categories of data (PPS numbers, financial information), which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 and Article 9.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). The compromise of multiple staff email accounts and the ability of attackers to set up rules to hide emails demonstrates inadequate security measures.

3. The controller violated Article 33(1) by not notifying the supervisory authority (DPC) of the personal data breach without undue delay and not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The breach occurred in September 2018, but the controller only notified the DPC in November 2018, after an external investigation was completed.

4. The controller violated Article 38(1) by not involving the Data Protection Officer in a timely manner regarding data protection issues. The DPO was only notified after the controller had already initiated an external investigation, rather than immediately upon discovery of the breach.

5. The processing of special category data (PPS numbers) without appropriate safeguards violates Article 9(1), as the controller failed to implement proper security measures for this sensitive data.

6. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), as the security measures implemented were not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to personal data.

7. The delay in notification to the supervisory authority and the failure to immediately involve the DPO demonstrate a lack of accountability under Article 5(2), as the controller could not demonstrate proper compliance with GDPR requirements.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including inadequate security measures, untimely breach notification, failure to properly involve the DPO, and insufficient protection of special category data."
"The Italian supervisory authority investigated the cookie practices of the www.onlinestore.it website on its own volition. The website belonged to e-commerce company Società Onlinestore S.r.l. (the data controller).

The website’s cookie banner stated that the website used cookies (including third-party cookies) to offer a better browser experience and that users could edit their cookie preferences.

The banner included three options: “Accept”, “Customize”, and “Learn more”. The banner included no option to reject cookies and no “X” icon to close the banner. The “Customized” option opened a drop-down menu with preferences for both necessary cookies and profiling cookies. Profiling cookies were pre-selected by default and could be de-selected by the user.

The authority tested the website and found that the same number of cookies were placed regardless of user preference.

In its preliminary view, the authority held that the data controller did not allow users to express informed, freely given, and granular consent. The authority also held that the controller failed to provide users with a clear and transparent cookie notice. In the authority’s view, the controller violated Articles 4(11), 5, 7, 24, and 25 GDPR, Article 122 d. lgs. 196/2003, and the authority's guidelines on cookies and other trackers.

The data controller took the website offline as soon as it was informed of the investigation. The controller did not challenge the authority’s views and stated that it did not assess the compliance of its cookie implementation.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25","1. The case involves a data controller, Società Onlinestore S.r.l., processing personal data through cookies on its website, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The cookie banner did not provide an option to reject cookies or an ""X"" icon to close it without accepting, which means users could not freely choose to deny consent. This violates the requirement for consent to be freely given under Article 4(11), which defines consent as requiring an unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes through a clear affirmative action.

3. The ""Customize"" option had profiling cookies pre-selected by default, which does not constitute a clear affirmative action by the user. Pre-selected options are not valid consent, as per Article 4(11) and Article 7(1), which states that consent must be given by a clear affirmative action.

4. The authority found that the same number of cookies were placed regardless of user preference, indicating that the controller did not respect user choices. This violates the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), as processing must be based on valid consent, and the principle of fairness, as users were misled about their control over data processing.

5. The controller failed to provide a transparent cookie notice, as the banner options were misleading and did not clearly inform users about the processing. This violates the transparency requirement under Article 5(1)(a) and the specific information obligations under Article 13, where controllers must provide clear information about processing purposes.

6. The controller admitted that it did not assess the compliance of its cookie implementation, which violates Article 24, which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR.

7. The pre-selection of profiling cookies by default violates data protection by default under Article 25(2), which requires that by default, only personal data necessary for the specific purpose are processed, and users should not be forced into unnecessary processing.

8. The practices also likely violate Article 7(4), as the conditioning of access to the website on accepting cookies for non-necessary purposes (like profiling) may not make consent freely given, especially since no reject option was provided.

Hidroelectrica SA) that experienced a personal data breach due to a technical error during the launch of its app, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of personal data belonging to a significant number of data subjects (Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'personal data breach').

2. Under Article 32(1) GDPR, the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

3. The investigation revealed that the breach occurred due to a technical error during the app launch, indicating that the controller failed to implement adequate security measures to prevent such unauthorized disclosure, thereby violating Article 32(1).

4. Additionally, Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized processing, which was not maintained in this case.

5. While the controller fulfilled its obligation to notify the supervisory authority of the breach under Article 33, this does not absolve it from responsibility for failing to prevent the breach through appropriate security measures.

"The data subject attempted to unsubscribe from a newsletter sent by a company. On September 29, 2019, the data subject submitted a request to unsubscribe through the controller’s website. The controller confirmed the removal of the email address from the mailing list on October 17, 2019. However, the data subject continued to receive newsletters on several occasions, specifically on October 26, October 29, and November 1, 2019.

On December 16, 2020, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Romanian data protection authority, which subsequently referred the matter to the Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH) in accordance with the GDPR’s cooperation mechanism. The NAIH commenced an investigation (case number: NAIH-1478/2021), during which the controller acknowledged a technical issue that prevented the unsubscribe requests from reaching the newsletter system.

The case involves a data subject who attempted to unsubscribe from a newsletter and a controller (the company sending the newsletter) as defined in Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

2. The data subject exercised their right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes by submitting an unsubscribe request on September 29, 2019, as provided for in Article 21(2) and (3) of the GDPR, which states that where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to such processing, and where the data subject objects, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.

3. The controller failed to honor this objection effectively, as the data subject continued to receive newsletters on October 26, October 29, and November 1, 2019, despite the controller's confirmation of removal on October 17, 2019. This constitutes a violation of Article 21(3) of the GDPR.

4. The controller's acknowledgment of a technical issue that prevented unsubscribe requests from reaching the newsletter system demonstrates a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR, as required by Article 24(1).

5. The controller also failed to facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights under Articles 15-22, as required by Article 12(2), since the technical issue prevented the effective execution of the data subject's right to object.

6. The continued processing of the data subject's personal data for direct marketing purposes after their objection also violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing was no longer based on a valid legal basis once the objection was made.

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"In 2020 the Italian DPA fined telecom Wind Tre, the controller, €16,729,600 for the unlawful processing of personal data and unauthorised marketing communications to customers. The authority also ordered the controller to stop processing data acquired without consent.

Months later the DPA started a follow-up investigation of the company’s compliance with their orders. In particular, the DPA investigated the controller’s reliance on marketing subcontractors, its use of “cold lists” of contact data, and the collection and documentation of consumer's consent.

Additionally, the decision addressed several complaints against the controller over aggressive marketing practices.

The ex-officio investigation (procedure 178557)

The ex-officio investigation started in 2022 as a follow-up to the DPA’s 2020 decision against the controller. The DPA investigated the controller’s premises and requested information over certain features of its marketing systems and over the operations of its subcontractors.

The DPA found that 15 contracts were finalized with different numbers from those targeted by the controller’s campaign. These contracts were finalized by three different contractors (all of which qualified as processors under the GDPR). By hiring each processor, the controller violated several provisions of the GDPR. First, the controller was unable to prove that the data subjects were contacted with their consent. Second, two processors violated the controller’s established storage periods for customer data. Finally, one of the processors was established in Moldova and did not have an EU representative.

The use of cold lists bought from third-party websites raised compliance issues. The controller was unable to prove the consent to the use of numbers bought for third-party websites. Additionally, a single phone number was bought without the data subject’s consent.

Over time the data controller implemented several measures to bring its marketing activities into compliance, including:

* a new campaign management system to better track the operations of contractors;
* a quality control system to ensure compliance along the value chain;
* more rigorous selections and auditing of contractors;
* measures to protect its customers from CLI spoofing calls.

Crucially, the controller also stopped using “cold lists” for consumer marketing in December 2022.

The first complaint (procedure 133372)

The first complaint comes from a customer of the data controller, the data subject. When she activated the controller’s services, she denied all consents to marketing communications.

The data subject later consented to direct marketing from a third party, the processor. The controller had engaged this third party as a data processor. As a result, the data subject still received marketing communications for the controller’s services despite having denied her consent to the controller.

The second complaint (procedure 25395)

In 2021, a data subject received an unwanted SMS. He reached out to the controller and asked for his number to be blacklisted but kept receiving messages afterwards.

The controller claimed that it blacklisted the data subject and that the unwanted communications were caused by an unpredictable human error. It also claimed that its new Campaign Management system would prevent similar incidents in the future.

The third complaint (procedure 262138)

A misconfiguration in the controller’s Customer Relationship Management system resulted in a data breach on the controller’s website: a customer logged into another customer’s personal area after accidentally using the wrong client code.

The controller immediately fixed the vulnerability but did not notify the breach to the authority.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 24, Article 28, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves Wind Tre as the data controller, which is subject to the GDPR as it processes personal data of individuals in the EU, as per Article 3 on territorial scope.

2. The ex-officio investigation revealed that the controller hired processors (subcontractors) for marketing activities but was unable to prove that data subjects had given consent for marketing communications, violating Article 6(1)(a) which requires processing to be based on consent, and Article 7(1) which mandates that the controller must be able to demonstrate consent.

3. Two processors violated the controller's established storage periods for personal data, which contravenes Article 5(1)(e) on storage limitation, requiring that data be kept no longer than necessary, and Article 28(3) which obligates processors to follow the controller's instructions, including storage policies.

4. One processor was established in Moldova without an EU representative, violating Article 27 which requires controllers or processors not established in the EU to designate a representative in the Union when processing data of EU data subjects.

5. The controller used ""cold lists"" purchased from third-party websites without being able to prove consent for the data processing, which again violates Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7(1). Additionally, one phone number was bought without any consent, directly breaching Article 6(1)(a).

6. In the first complaint (procedure 133372), the data subject denied consent to the controller but later consented to a processor, who then sent marketing communications on behalf of the controller. This processing lacked valid consent for the controller's purposes, violating Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7, as consent must be specific to the controller and purpose, and the controller is responsible for processors' actions under Article 28.

7. In the second complaint (procedure 25395), the data subject objected to marketing communications and requested blacklisting, but continued to receive messages. This violates Article 21(3) which requires that upon objection to direct marketing, processing must cease immediately.

8. In the third complaint (procedure 262138), a data breach occurred due to a misconfiguration in the controller's system, allowing unauthorized access to personal data. The controller failed to notify the supervisory authority of this breach, violating Article 33(1) which mandates notification without undue delay and within 72 hours if feasible, especially since unauthorized access likely posed a risk to rights and freedoms.

9. Although the controller implemented measures to improve compliance, such as a new campaign management system and auditing, the aforementioned violations had already occurred and were not fully mitigated in a timely manner, indicating systemic noncompliance with GDPR principles.

10. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA started an ex officio investigation, after a large journalist investigation was published, against a municipality, the controller. The investigation concerned the practice of the municipal cemetery of burying “fetuses” and “stillborn children”.

Each of the tombstones contains the same first name (which is a name traditionally assigned to stillborn children in Italian Catholic tradition), and different surnames, which correspond to the surname of the data subjects, who are the women who interrupted their pregnancy and the men who these women conceived the fetus with. The DPA found that, in the vast majority of cases, these data subjects did not know about the burial site and of the use of their surnames.

Additionally, the preliminary investigation of the DPA revealed that, in the online portal of the cemetery, it was possible to find the precise location of each tombstone by typing in the name and surname thereon written. The data available through this online research was name, surname, date of birth and death, as well as the specification of their status of “fetuses” or “stillborn child”.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves a municipality acting as a data controller processing personal data related to fetuses and stillborn children, including surnames of the parents, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(1) and falls within the material scope of the Regulation per Article 2.

2. The processing involves special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), specifically data concerning health (pregnancy status) and potentially religious beliefs (given the Catholic tradition context), which are subject to stricter processing conditions.

3. The controller failed to obtain explicit consent from the data subjects (the parents) for processing this sensitive data, as required by Article 9(2)(a), and no other applicable exception under Article 9(2) appears to justify this processing without consent.

4. The controller violated Article 5(1)(a) principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency by processing personal data without the knowledge of the data subjects and without providing the required information under Articles 13 (where data collected from data subject) or 14 (where data not obtained from data subject).

5. The publication of this sensitive data through an online portal making it searchable by name and surname violates Article 5(1)(f) integrity and confidentiality principle, as appropriate security measures were not implemented to protect this sensitive data from unauthorized access.

6. The processing fails to comply with data minimization principles under Article 5(1)(c), as the disclosure of surnames and specific details online exceeds what is necessary for the purpose of burial administration.

7. The controller did not conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35 for this high-risk processing of sensitive data on a large scale, which is required given the nature and scope of the processing.

8. The processing violates Article 17 Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten') as the data subjects were not informed about the processing and could not exercise their right to object to this processing of their personal data.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including unlawful processing of special category data, lack of transparency, insufficient security measures, and failure to conduct required impact assessments."
"After the Bank of Italy notified the DPA of a personal data breach, the DPA decided to start an ex officio investigation. The notification concerned requests for information advanced by the legal representative of a credit repair company to the databases of national banks. Credit repair consists of finding and fixing mistakes on your credit report to boost one's credit score. The legal representative was appointed as processor, while the credit rehabilitation company was the controller.

All these access requests concerned natural persons, the data subjects, who did not give any authorization for the search.

The DPA advanced a request for information to the controller, which remained unanswered. Thus, the DPA started an investigation, which revealed the following.

First, the controller deals primarily with the erasure of credit reports by banks. Data subjects reach out to the controller through their website. Subsequently, the controller calls the data subject about this service.

Second, when the controller calls the data subject, the controller gives information on data processing by means of a prerecorded voice to give the data subjects an overview on the services offered. Then, if the data subjects accepted, their data is collected. However, not all data present in the database was collected from the data subjects.

Third, the Privacy Policy is shared, first, with the data subjects via telephone, on the date of the the first phone contact and, for the second time, when they fill out a form on “mandate to act” in public and private central credit rating centers.

Fourth, the controller’s database revealed that:

* The controller's IT system contains data regarding 74,214 data subjects. This data includes: name, surname, place and data of birth, social security number and contact details.
* In each customer file, there are also the reports provided, by the companies and banking institutions, in response to requests for access made by the controller through the processor.
* In the IT system, personal data held by other credit rehabilitation companies could be consulted for insolvency recovery purposes.
* The aforementioned data, collected via paper forms, was given by every customer and was stored in the controller's office.

Finally, there were no systematic procedures for periodic deletion of old data. The controller retained the complete paper files and digital records, even if it no longer had any contractual relationship with those data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 14, Article 24, Article 28, Article 37, Article 38","1. The controller (credit repair company) processed personal data without a valid legal basis under Article 6, as they accessed bank databases containing financial information without obtaining proper consent from data subjects or establishing another lawful processing condition. The prerecorded voice information and subsequent data collection did not constitute valid consent under Article 7, as consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.

2. The controller failed to provide adequate information to data subjects under Article 13 when collecting data directly from them, and under Article 14 when processing data obtained from banks (third-party sources). The Privacy Policy was shared only after initial contact and through incomplete methods (prerecorded voice and later forms), violating the requirement to provide transparent information at the time of data collection.

3. The controller processed special categories of personal data (financial information potentially revealing economic situation) without meeting the conditions under Article 9 for processing sensitive data. Accessing credit reports and financial data requires explicit consent or other specific legal bases which were not properly established.

4. The controller violated Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation) by retaining complete paper files and digital records indefinitely without systematic deletion procedures, even after contractual relationships with data subjects had ended.

5. The processor (legal representative) accessed credit databases without proper authorization under Article 10, which requires processing of data relating to criminal convictions or credit offenses to be carried out only under official authority or with specific legal authorization.

6. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 25 (data protection by design and by default) and Article 32 (security of processing), as evidenced by the insecure storage of sensitive data in both digital and paper formats without proper access controls.

7. The controller violated Article 31 by failing to cooperate with the supervisory authority (DPA) by not responding to the initial request for information, which is a mandatory requirement under GDPR.

8. The processing activities violated the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as data subjects were not properly informed about how their data would be used and the controller accessed sensitive financial information without proper authorization.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"A data breach was notified to the DPA by an employee of the e-billing website Webrasoft SRL, the controller, as per Article 33 GDPR. The DPA deemed it appropriate to start an investigation.

The investigation revealed that the controller was victim of a cyberattack, and that the server on which the customer database was stored was illegally accessed.

The data illegally accessed included: name, surname, personal numeric code, home address, telephone, e-mail address and bank account number.

Moreover, the investigation revealed that the controller did not carry out the periodic testing, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Webrasoft SRL as the controller processing personal data, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 4 definitions.
2. A data breach occurred where personal data, including name, surname, personal numeric code, home address, telephone, email address, and bank account number, was illegally accessed due to a cyberattack, indicating a failure to ensure appropriate security measures as required by Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which mandates processing in a manner that ensures security against unauthorized access.
3. The investigation revealed that the controller did not carry out periodic testing, evaluation, and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for security, which is a direct violation of Article 32(1)(d) GDPR, which requires a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of such measures.
4. Article 32(1) GDPR obligates controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, and the lack of periodic testing demonstrates noncompliance with this obligation.
5. The breach notification under Article 33 GDPR was made, but this does not absolve the controller from its responsibilities under Article 32 to maintain adequate security measures.
6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy due to violations of Article 32(1)(d) and Article 5(1)(f)."
"Various violations were identified:

1. Improper Disposal of Test Results In a medical practice offering COVID-19 tests, employees disposed of positive and negative antigen test results in a garbage bag next to a public glass recycling container. The documents contained sensitive health data under Article 9 GDPR and were accessible to unauthorized third parties. Despite acknowledging the increased burden on medical practices during the pandemic, the Hamburg DPA deemed this handling of health data unacceptable. A fine of €1,000 was imposed, which the practice accepted.

2. Refusal to Grant Data Deletion Requests A dedicated COVID-19 test center consistently ignored individuals’ requests for data deletion, violating Article 17 GDPR. Even after the Hamburg DPA intervened and initiated administrative proceedings, the test center refused to comply. Due to the systematic nature of the violation, the Hamburg DPA imposed a fine of €1,000, which the test center accepted.

3. Unsecured Online Access to Test Results Another test center provided test results via unencrypted email containing a direct URL to a PDF file. The URL structure included the tested person’s last name, making it easy to access other individuals' results by modifying the URL. This was a clear violation of Article 32(1) GDPR, as the test center failed to implement appropriate security measures. The Hamburg DPA imposed a fine of €2,700.

4. Unlawful Storage of ID Card Copies A fourth test center scanned and stored both the front and back of tested individuals' ID cards on an external hard drive. This exceeded the legal requirements for documentation under the German Coronavirus Testing Regulation. There was no legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR for storing complete ID card copies, and the practice posed a significant security risk. The test center did not cooperate with the Hamburg DPA to address the issue, leading to a fine of approximately €1,400.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17, Article 32","1. The case involves a medical practice and test centers processing personal data, including special categories of health data, which falls under the scope of GDPR as outlined in Article 1 (subject-matter and objectives) and Article 9 (processing of special categories of personal data).

2. For the first violation, the improper disposal of test results containing health data in a publicly accessible garbage bag violates Article 32(1) GDPR, which requires appropriate security measures to protect personal data, including protection against unauthorized access. Additionally, it violates Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality principle) and Article 9, which prohibits processing of special categories of data without appropriate safeguards.

3. For the second violation, the refusal to grant data deletion requests violates Article 17 GDPR (right to erasure), which gives data subjects the right to have their personal data erased under certain conditions. The test center's systematic refusal to comply, even after intervention by the supervisory authority, demonstrates a clear breach of this obligation.

4. For the third violation, providing test results via unencrypted email with easily guessable URLs violates Article 32(1) GDPR, which mandates implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access. This also violates Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality).

5. For the fourth violation, the unlawful storage of ID card copies without a legal basis violates Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, as there was no legal requirement to store complete ID card copies under the German Coronavirus Testing Regulation. This also violates Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization principle), as the processing exceeded what was necessary for the specified purpose.

6. The cumulative effect of these violations, including the lack of cooperation with the supervisory authority in some instances, demonstrates a failure to comply with multiple GDPR provisions across Articles 5, 6, 9, 17, and 32.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"CP&A B.V., a company specializing in inspection and maintenance of public infrastructure, maintained an online absence registration system containing sensitive health data of 25 employees. The system, stored in a Google Drive file, was accessible without authentication or access controls from 12 March 2019, to 2 May 2019. The data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, BSN (Dutch citizen service number), dates of birth, and detailed health information such as reasons for absence, prognoses, and medical comments. The Dutch DPA found that CP&A violated the GDPR by processing special category data (health information) without adequate legal grounds and failing to implement appropriate security measures.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 32","1. The case involves CP&A B.V. processing sensitive health data of employees, which qualifies as special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, including information about health, racial or ethnic origin, and identification numbers like BSN.

2. CP&A processed this special category data without a lawful basis as required by Article 9(2), as there is no indication that explicit consent was obtained, nor does the processing appear necessary for carrying out obligations in employment law under Article 9(2)(b), or for other permissible reasons under Article 9(2).

3. The company stored the data in a Google Drive file accessible without authentication or access controls, failing to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as mandated by Article 32(1), which requires measures such as pseudonymisation, encryption, and confidentiality.

4. The lack of security measures led to unauthorized access potential from 12 March 2019 to 2 May 2019, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f), which requires personal data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security.

5. The processing also likely contravened the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the data was not processed lawfully without a valid basis under Article 6 or Article 9.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"International Card Services B.V. (ICS) failed to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before implementing a customer re-identification process (ID&V) in 2019. The process involved the large-scale processing of sensitive personal data, including names, birthdates, addresses, BSN (Dutch citizen service number), and ID document details, for approximately 1.5 million customers in the Netherlands.

ICS is a 100% subsidiary of ABN AMRO. Since 2015, ABN AMRO has been using an application from Mitek Systems B.V. (Mitek app) to determine the identity of its customers.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 35,"1. The case involves International Card Services B.V. (ICS) processing personal data on a large scale, including sensitive categories such as citizen service numbers (BSN) and ID document details, which qualifies as processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) and data relating to criminal convictions under Article 10.

2. According to Article 35(1), a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is required prior to processing where a type of processing, particularly using new technologies, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. Article 35(3) specifies that a DPIA shall in particular be required in the case of processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1) or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.

4. ICS processed sensitive personal data, including BSN (a national identification number) and ID document details, for approximately 1.5 million customers, which constitutes large-scale processing of special categories of data under Article 9(1) and therefore triggers the mandatory DPIA requirement under Article 35(3)(b).

5. The implementation of a customer re-identification process using new technology (Mitek app) for identity verification further increases the likelihood of high risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms, reinforcing the DPIA requirement under Article 35(1).

6. ICS failed to conduct a DPIA before implementing this processing activity in 2019, which constitutes a direct violation of Article 35(1) and Article 35(3)(b).

7. The failure to conduct a required DPIA also violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation's requirements.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The municipality of Voorschoten implemented a waste collection system using chipped containers and tokens to regulate household waste disposal. The system collected personal data, including addresses, container/token numbers, and timestamps of waste disposal. The municipality stored this data for extended periods (up to five years for tokens and indefinitely for containers).

At the end of 2018, the above-ground shared containers were replaced by underground containers to serve residents of high-rise buildings. Undergroung containers can only be opened with a token, which contains a chip with a unique number. It can be determined for each underground container which tokens have access to the container. A container can be opened five times a day, after which access to the container is denied. After the container has been opened with a token, the municipality stores data in a municipal IT system. This concerns token number, address details, date and time of the dumping, location details and type of waste. This data was stored for five years.

In March 2019, all grey residual waste containers were replaced by new containers with a chip for low-rise buildings. Each household (residential address) now has only one container. The garbage truck is equipped with a reader that can read the number of the chip. If it is recognised, the container is emptied. The municipality then stores data in an IT system of the municipality's collection service. This concerns the chip number, the associated address, date and time of emptying, location data of emptying and type of waste. The container cannot then be emptied again for two weeks because the garbage truck will not accept the container. This data remained in the IT system as long as the container was in use and the data was deleted from the system when the container was replaced.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 14","1. The case involves the municipality of Voorschoten processing personal data (addresses, container/token numbers, timestamps, location data) through its waste collection system, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1), as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The municipality stores token-related data for five years and container data indefinitely (as long as the container is in use). This violates the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary for the purposes of processing. The extended retention periods are disproportionate to waste management purposes.

3. The processing fails to comply with the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b), as storing data for five years/indefinitely exceeds the original collection purpose (waste management operations). Any further processing for purposes like enforcement or statistics would require separate legal basis and safeguards under Articles 6(4) and 89, which are not demonstrated.

4. The municipality likely lacks a valid lawful basis under Article 6 for prolonged storage. While public interest (Article 6(1)(e)) might apply to waste management, it does not justify indefinite retention without specific legal authorization meeting proportionality requirements under Article 6(3).

5. The case violates transparency obligations under Articles 13 and 14, as residents were not adequately informed about the extended retention periods or the purposes of prolonged storage, particularly regarding container data stored indefinitely.

6. The processing violates data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as storing detailed historical waste disposal data (including exact timestamps and locations) for years is not necessary for waste collection services. Pseudonymization or aggregation could achieve statistical purposes without prolonged identifiability.

7. For underground containers limiting access to five openings per day, the system involves automated decision-making affecting access to services, requiring safeguards under Article 22. No evidence shows provision of meaningful information about logic or rights to human intervention.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b)), data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)), transparency (Articles 13-14), and potentially lawful basis requirements (Article 6)."
"An employee of a home appliances online shop, the controller, notified a data breach to the DPA, as per Article 33 GDPR.

The DPA started an investigation, that revealed that an unauthorized person took advantage of a programming vulnerability and, consequently, accessed the website of the operator containing its customers’, the data subjects’, database.

Thus, the person concerned had access to the personal data of a large number of data subjects of the operator, namely: name, surname, telephone number, e-mail address, domicile, product details.

The investigation revealed that the controller did not carry out the regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the efficiency of technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves a controller (the home appliances online shop) processing personal data of its customers (data subjects), which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as the processing is carried out by automated means in the context of the controller's commercial activities.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach where an unauthorized individual accessed the customer database due to a programming vulnerability, compromising personal data including names, telephone numbers, email addresses, domiciles, and product details, as described in the case.

3. Article 32(1) of the GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including ""a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.""

4. The investigation by the DPA revealed that the controller failed to carry out the regular testing, evaluation, and assessment of the efficiency of technical and organisational measures, which constitutes a direct violation of Article 32(1)(d) of the GDPR.

5. The principle of accountability under Article 5(2) requires the controller to be responsible for, and able to demonstrate compliance with, the principles relating to processing of personal data, including the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f), which mandates processing in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data.

6. By failing to implement regular security testing, the controller did not meet the requirements of Article 32 and consequently breached the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f), as the lack of testing contributed to the vulnerability that led to the unauthorized access.

7. The case involves a breach of personal data that could have been prevented or mitigated by adhering to the security obligations under Article 32, specifically the requirement for regular testing and evaluation of security measures.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy due to the controller's failure to implement appropriate security measures as required by Article 32(1), particularly the regular testing and evaluation of technical and organisational measures."
"The DPA received numerous complaints against the Greek National Bank (the controller) concerning the violation of the right of access of data subjects under Article 15 GDPR, due to non-satisfaction or long delays. Following this, the DPA investigated - ex officio - the procedures followed by the controller for such access requests.

The DPA found that in one instance the controller had used the data subject's personal data in the context of litigation between the two parties which the data subject itself had previously requested and had not been granted even after the expiration of the submission-deadline, resulting in an unfavorable evidentiary position for the data subject.

In other cases, the DPA found that the controller only responded after between two to seven months, sometimes only partially or after intervention of the DPA.

The controller stated that in recent years there has been an increase in electronic fraud cases, which had lead to a rapid increase in corresponding requests. According to the controller, every possible effort was made to serve its customers, seeking to exhaust every margin for their recovery, however, the proper and complete investigation of these incidents often proves to be time-consuming, as it requires a thorough search of the controller's files and systems, cooperation of all involved areas, evaluation of the actual incidents and communication with the other parties involved (e.g. beneficiary's bank, etc.). The controller also invoked its teleworking arrangements, due to which their access to the requested information was not possible in some cases.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 25","1. The case involves the Greek National Bank as a data controller processing personal data of data subjects who submitted access requests under Article 15 GDPR, which grants data subjects the right to obtain confirmation and access to their personal data being processed.

2. The DPA found that the controller failed to respond to access requests within the required timeframe specified in Article 12(3) GDPR, which states that the controller must provide information on action taken on a request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request, extendable by two further months only where necessary considering the complexity and number of requests.

3. The controller's responses were delayed between two to seven months, far exceeding the maximum three-month period allowed under Article 12(3) GDPR, even when accounting for possible extensions, thus violating the timely response requirement.

4. In some instances, the controller provided only partial responses to access requests, which violates Article 15 GDPR requiring controllers to provide complete information including all personal data undergoing processing and the specified categories of information listed in Article 15(1)(a)-(h).

5. The controller's justification based on increased electronic fraud cases and teleworking arrangements does not constitute valid grounds for extension under Article 12(3) GDPR, as the regulation does not recognize operational difficulties or remote working challenges as legitimate reasons for exceeding response timeframes.

6. The controller's use of the data subject's personal data in litigation while simultaneously failing to provide the same data to the data subject upon request violates the principle of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and constitutes a breach of the right of access under Article 15.

7. The controller's failure to respond to access requests resulted in an unfavorable evidentiary position for the data subject in litigation, demonstrating actual harm caused by the non-compliance with access rights under Article 15 GDPR.

8. The systematic nature of the violations, evidenced by numerous complaints and the DPA's ex officio investigation, indicates a pattern of non-compliance rather than isolated incidents, aggravating the severity of the violations under Article 83(2) GDPR considerations.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy, specifically violating Articles 5(1)(a), 12(3), and 15 GDPR regarding the right of access and corresponding controller obligations."
"A company (the controller) with 337 employees processed biometric data (fingerprints) of its employees to track their working hours using fingerprint scanners. On 5 July 2018, the Dutch DPA received a notification that employees at the controller were required to have their fingerprints scanned. This processing took place from 25 May 2018 to 16 April 2019.

The  DPA launched an investigation and concluded that employees were clocking in and out using their fingerprints for the purpose of time registration.

Five scanning stations are present and active at the company, three of which have a fingerprint scanner. One of these three is used for testing and recording fingerprints, the other two for clocking in and out. All these scanning stations exchange data with a software program, which, in addition to checking presence and absence, provides insight into working hours, absenteeism and overtime.

After the fingerprint has been recorded, the templates of those fingerprints are stored as a text file in a digital folder. These templates of fingerprints that have been recorded since the beginning of 2017.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 9,"1. The case involves a company (controller) processing biometric data (fingerprints) of its employees for time tracking purposes, which falls under the definition of ""processing"" and ""biometric data"" as per Article 4 of the policy.

2. The processing of biometric data for uniquely identifying natural persons is classified as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), which prohibits such processing unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies.

3. The controller processed employee fingerprints without demonstrating that any exception under Article 9(2) applied, particularly:
   - There is no evidence of explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a), and consent in an employment context may not be freely given due to the imbalance of power
   - Time tracking does not fall under the necessary exceptions for employment/social security (Article 9(2)(b)), vital interests (Article 9(2)(c)), or substantial public interest (Article 9(2)(g))

4. The processing violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as less intrusive means (e.g., key cards or PIN codes) were available for time tracking purposes without processing biometric data.

5. The storage of fingerprint templates as text files raises concerns about appropriate security measures under Article 32, particularly regarding the confidentiality and integrity of special category data.

6. The Dutch DPA's investigation confirmed the processing occurred from May 2018 to April 2019 without a valid legal basis for processing special category biometric data.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to unauthorized processing of special category biometric data in violation of Article 9 and failure to implement data minimization principles under Article 5."

3. Article 32(1) of the GDPR specifies that the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

4. The DPA's investigation revealed that the controller did not implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the required security level, as evidenced by the vulnerability in the employee's server that led to the illegal access of the database.

5. The breach notification under Article 33, while complied with by the employee, does not absolve the controller of its underlying obligations under Articles 5 and 32 to implement adequate security measures to prevent such breaches from occurring.

6. The failure to implement appropriate security measures constitutes a violation of both the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) and the specific security requirements under Article 32(1) of the GDPR.

"According to the KNLTB estimates, there are 1,782 tennis clubs in the Netherlands, of which 1,657 (or 97%) are affiliated with the KNLTB. According to the KNLTB website, almost 570,000 tennis players are affiliated with the KNLTB (via these tennis clubs), making the KNLTB the second largest sports association in the Netherlands.

From March 2018 to October 2018, the KNLTB initiated actions with two sponsors in which personal data such as name, address and place of residence and telephone numbers of KNLTB members were used. One sponsor sent two discount flyers by post to a selection of KNLTB members and the other sponsor called a selection of KNLTB members in a telemarketing campaign to sell products.

On 22 October 2018, the Dutch DPA launched an investigation into the provision by the KNLTB of personal data of its members to sponsors with the aim of approaching the members with ‘tennis-related and other offers’ after receiving tips and complaints from a number of members. On 7 May 2019, the DPA adopted its investigation report.

For one specific marketing campaing, the information of 314,846 members was sent to one of the sponsors.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the KNLTB, a tennis association acting as a data controller, processing personal data (name, address, place of residence, telephone numbers) of its members by providing this data to sponsors for marketing purposes (sending discount flyers and telemarketing calls).

2. The processing of personal data for marketing purposes requires a lawful basis under Article 6 of the policy. While consent could serve as a lawful basis, the policy in Article 7 requires that consent be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The case does not indicate that KNLTB members provided valid consent for their data to be shared with sponsors for marketing purposes.

3. The policy in Articles 13 and 14 requires controllers to provide specific information to data subjects when collecting their personal data, including the purposes of processing, recipients of the data, and the right to withdraw consent. The case does not demonstrate that KNLTB provided this necessary information to its members regarding the sharing of their data with sponsors.

4. Article 21 of the policy grants data subjects the right to object at any time to processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes. The case does not indicate that KNLTB informed members of this right or provided a mechanism for them to easily object to the processing.

5. The policy in Article 5 requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Sharing member data with sponsors without proper consent or other lawful basis, and without transparent communication about this processing, violates these fundamental principles.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"The HagaZiekenhuis hospital, a Dutch healthcare provider, reported a data breach on 4 April 2018 involving unauthorised access to the medical records of a well-known individual. An investigation revealed that 197 employees, including 85 who were unauthorised, had accessed the patient's records. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, AP) found that the hospital had failed to implement two-factor authentication and regularly review log files, as required by Article 32(1) GDPR, since January 2018. These failures left sensitive health data inadequately protected against unauthorised access.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves HagaZiekenhuis hospital, a healthcare provider processing sensitive health data, which qualifies as a controller under Article 4(7) GDPR due to its role in determining purposes and means of processing personal data.

2. The personal data involved includes medical records, which constitute special categories of data under Article 9(1) GDPR (data concerning health), requiring enhanced protection measures under the Regulation.

3. Article 32(1) GDPR requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including pseudonymisation, encryption, confidentiality, availability, and resilience of processing systems.

4. The investigation revealed the hospital failed to implement two-factor authentication and regular review of log files, which are fundamental security measures for protecting sensitive health data against unauthorized access.

5. Article 5(1)(f) GDPR establishes the principle of integrity and confidentiality, requiring that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access.

6. The breach involving 85 unauthorized employees accessing sensitive health data demonstrates a clear violation of both Article 32(1) security requirements and Article 5(1)(f) integrity and confidentiality principles.

7. Article 32(2) specifically requires that security measures shall ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services, which the hospital failed to maintain through inadequate access controls.

8. The duration of non-compliance (since January 2018) indicates a persistent failure to implement necessary security measures, exacerbating the violation of GDPR requirements.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to violations of Article 32(1) security requirements, Article 5(1)(f) integrity and confidentiality principles, and the enhanced protection obligations for special category data under Article 9."
"A financial institution (the controller) processed personal data regarding loans applied for by their clients or potential clients (data subjects). To assess data subjects’ creditworthiness, the controller relied on profiling. For this purpose, the controller processed inter alia name, surname, national identification number (PESEL), source of income and information on financial obligations. The profiling resulted in credit scoring, used by the controller to make a decision about a loan application.

The Polish DPA (UODO carried out an ex officio inspection of controller’s profiling. The inspection purpose was to verify the processing compliance with the GDPR.

The inspection raised doubts over controller’s DPO position. A person appointed as the DPO was also employed as a consultant within a department responsible for data security. That department was also managing controller’s personal data processing. Within controller’s structure, the DPO was under direct authority of a director of the data security department.

Moreover, the DPA found no data protection impact assessment to be carried out for controller’s profiling. Also, controller’s record of processing activates was lacking profiling.

Thus, the DPA initiated proceedings against the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 30, Article 35, Article 38","1. The case involves a financial institution (controller) processing personal data through profiling for creditworthiness assessments, which includes special categories of data like national identification numbers (PESEL) and financial information, falling under the GDPR's material scope (Article 2).

2. The controller appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who also served as a consultant in the data security department, which manages personal data processing, and reported directly to the director of that department. This violates Article 38(3) and (6), which require that the DPO must not receive instructions regarding their tasks, must report to the highest management level, and must not have conflicts of interest, especially when involved in determining processing purposes and means.

3. The controller did not conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for the profiling activities. Profiling that produces legal effects concerning individuals (e.g., credit decisions) is high-risk processing under Article 35(3)(a), requiring a DPIA. The absence of a DPIA violates Article 35(1) and (7).

4. The controller's record of processing activities lacked details of the profiling operations. Article 30(1) mandates that records include purposes, categories of data subjects, and categories of personal data processed. Omission of profiling violates this requirement.

5. The combination of these violations—DPO conflict of interest, lack of DPIA, and incomplete records—demonstrates systemic noncompliance with GDPR principles of accountability and data protection by design (Articles 5(2), 24, and 25).

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A notification of an incident of a violation was submitted to the DPA by the company “ALPHA BANK S.A.” (the controller), stating that an incident of unauthorized access to personal data occurred. This occurred because an employee's role in the system was not adapted when he was transferred to another organisational position against the controller's security policy. The employee shared some of the thus accessed information with others.

This was not noticed for a very long period of time (2015-2022) and resulted in 6,167 individuals being affected by the incident. The information to which unauthorized access was obtained concerned personal data of special categories (health and disability). The notification of the incident was late because an investigation was required to identify the source of the data leak and confirm the breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves ALPHA BANK S.A. as a data controller processing special categories of personal data (health and disability information) which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2, and requires enhanced protection under Article 9.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, they did not properly manage user access rights when an employee changed organizational positions, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f).

3. The unauthorized access to special category data (health and disability information) occurred due to inadequate security measures, violating Article 9 which prohibits processing of such data unless specific conditions are met. The controller failed to implement proper safeguards for processing special category data.

4. The breach persisted from 2015-2022 (approximately 7 years), indicating a failure to implement proper monitoring and review mechanisms to ensure ongoing security of processing, as required by Article 32(1)(d) and the accountability principle in Article 5(2).

5. The controller failed to notify the supervisory authority of the personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as required by Article 33(1). The delayed notification because ""an investigation was required"" does not justify the late reporting under GDPR requirements.

6. The breach affected 6,167 individuals and involved special category data, which likely constituted a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, yet there is no indication that the controller communicated the breach to the data subjects without undue delay as required by Article 34(1).

7. The controller's failure to properly manage access rights and detect the breach for an extended period demonstrates a lack of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, violating the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and the security requirements under Article 32.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including inadequate security measures, improper processing of special category data, failure to timely report the breach, and lack of appropriate organizational controls."
"The Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (controller) promoted the participation by cancer patients in a study being conducted by a data processor. The patients downloaded a mobile app and, using a code given to them by their oncologist, inputted data about their well-being.

In June 2023, the controller notified the AEPD (Spanish DPA) that the processor had suffered a breach of security which resulted in the unauthorised access to 2,622 patients' personal data by an intentional bad-actor. The personal data consisted of the participants' email addresses, their phone number and their health-related data.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves the processing of health-related data, which qualifies as a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, requiring enhanced protections and specific legal bases for processing.

2. The controller (Spanish Society of Medical Oncology) engaged a data processor to handle patients' personal data, including health data, which under Article 28(1) requires the controller to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to meet GDPR requirements.

3. The security breach resulting in unauthorized access to 2,622 patients' email addresses, phone numbers, and health data indicates a failure to implement appropriate security measures as required by Article 32(1), which mandates measures including pseudonymisation, encryption, and ongoing confidentiality to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, particularly given the sensitive nature of health data.

4. Article 33(1) requires controllers to notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. While notification occurred, the breach itself demonstrates insufficient security measures were in place.

5. Given the sensitivity of health data, the breach likely resulted in a high risk to patients' rights and freedoms, triggering under Article 34(1) an obligation to communicate the breach to affected data subjects without undue delay, which may not have been fulfilled adequately.

6. The controller bears responsibility under Article 5(2) (accountability principle) and Article 24(1) to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, including implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the regulation.

7. The breach indicates a failure in the controller's obligations to ensure the processor implemented sufficient security measures under Article 28(1) and Article 32, and potentially in conducting necessary due diligence and oversight of the processor's activities.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR due to failures in implementing appropriate security measures for sensitive health data, inadequate protection against unauthorized access, and potential shortcomings in breach communication and processor oversight obligations."
"The Italian data protection authority received many complaints of aggressive telemarketing practices carried out on behalf of energy company Energia Pulita S.r.l. (the data controller). Some of the complainants reported deceitful marketing practices. Others were called despite their number’s inclusion in Italy’s Do Not Call registry.

In November 2023 the authority started a broad investigation on the controller. Additionally, the authority required information about all of the purchase offers from February 5 to February 12 2024.

Privacy compliance and quality controls

The authority inquired about the measures taken by the data controller to ensure privacy compliance both in its own marketing activities, and in the marketing activities of its subcontractors (acting as data processors or sub-processors).

The controller implemented some technical and organizational measures to implement data protection principles, including quality check calls and checks for the recipient’s consent to marketing. Starting March 2024, the controller implemented a more robust privacy compliance program: for instance, the controller provided its employees with privacy training, and adopted more robust privacy standards for its contractors.

The authority found these measures to be insufficient. The authority held that the data controller failed to vigilate over the privacy practices of its subcontractors. Additionally, the controller failed to choose subcontractors with robust privacy practices. In this regard, the authority pointed out that it still received complaints about aggressive marketing on behalf of the controller after March 2024.

The authority also observed that controllers must adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the implementation of data protection principles from the very beginning of the data processing (data protection by default).

Consent and the Do Not Call registry

The data controller pointed out that some of the recipients (the data subjects) consented to the processing of their data for marketing purposes after their inclusion in the Do Not Call Registry. These consents were collected via four third-party websites where users provided their personal data in order to receive commercial offers. In the controller’s view, the data subjects’ consents authorized its marketing calls.

The authority found issues with the consents. Three websites (nuoveofferte.com, offertenergetiche.it, and ricercaofferte.it) prompted users to consent to marketing for a very broad range of products and services. After consent collection, personal data were shared with an undefined number of companies for marketing purposes, each acting as the data controller. Additionally, users could not choose the form of the marketing communications they would receive. A fourth website (Offerte-gas-luce.it) lacked a privacy notice altogether.

For these reasons, the authority held that the websites did not collect granular and free consent. In this regard, the authority referred to its own guidance on telemarketing.

The data controller also defended its practices by pointing out that energy contracts were not concluded over the phone: the phone calls only served to initiate contact and to direct prospective customers to the controller's website. For this reason, the controller argued that the calls were not a form of telemarketing and did not fall under the Italian rules on the Do Not Call registry.

The authority rejected the controller’s argument. In the authority’s view, calls that merely initiate contract with the customer, are nonetheless telemarketing. In this regard, the authority referred to the Code of Conduct on telemarketing and teleselling.

Job candidates and privacy notices

The authority inquired on the provision of information to the controller’s job applicants.

Individuals could apply for a job with the controller by providing personal data on its website. Initially, the controller would provide applicants with a privacy notice before the job interview. The data controller provided no notice at a collection and provided no information at all to applicants who did not show up for the job interview.

The data controller eventually improved its practices. Starting July 2024, the data controller started providing applicants with a notice at collection.

The authority held that the data controller violated its transparency obligations until July 2024. Additionally, the authority held that the controller did not correctly identify the legal bases for processing applicant’s data in the earlier version of its privacy notice.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 29, Article 32","1. The case involves Energia Pulita S.r.l. as a data controller processing personal data for telemarketing and job applications, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means.

2. For telemarketing, the controller relied on consent obtained from third-party websites, but the consent was not granular or specific, as it covered a broad range of products and services, and personal data was shared with an undefined number of companies, violating Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7, which require consent to be specific, informed, and unambiguous. Additionally, one website (Offerte-gas-luce.it) lacked a privacy notice altogether, violating Article 13, which mandates providing information to data subjects at the time of data collection.

3. The controller's argument that calls were not telemarketing because contracts were not concluded over the phone was rejected by the authority, and under GDPR, any processing for marketing purposes requires a lawful basis, such as valid consent. Since the consent was invalid, the processing is unlawful under Article 6(1).

4. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure compliance with GDPR, as required by Article 24. Specifically, the measures for monitoring subcontractors (processors) were insufficient, and the controller did not choose processors providing sufficient guarantees, violating Article 28(1).

5. The controller did not implement data protection by design and by default from the beginning of the processing activities, as required by Article 25, since improvements were made only after March 2024, and complaints continued, indicating a lack of inherent data protection measures.

6. For job applicants, the controller did not provide privacy notices at the time of data collection, only before interviews or not at all for some applicants, violating Article 13, which requires providing information when personal data is obtained. Additionally, the initial privacy notice incorrectly identified the legal bases for processing, violating Article 13(1)(c) regarding the purposes and legal basis for processing.

7. Therefore, based on violations of multiple GDPR articles, including Article 6, Article 7, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, and Article 28, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA conducted an ex officio investigation in relation to the telemarketing activities of real estate investor One United Properties SA (the data controller).

The investigation revealed several unsolicited commercial messages were sent to different data subjects over a prolonged time period. The controller was not able to prove the consent of the data subjects to the processing of their data for marketing purposes. Additionally, some data subjects requested multiple time to access their data and to have a confirmation of whether their data was being processed or deleted. The controller did not respond to such access request by the data subject.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17","1. The case involves a data controller (One United Properties SA) engaged in telemarketing activities, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) of the GDPR.

2. The controller sent unsolicited commercial messages without being able to prove valid consent from data subjects, violating Article 6(1)(a) which requires processing to be based on the data subject's consent for specific purposes, and Article 7 which specifies conditions for valid consent.

3. The controller failed to respond to multiple data access requests from data subjects, violating Article 15 which grants data subjects the right to obtain confirmation about whether their personal data is being processed and access to such data.

4. The controller's failure to respond to access requests also violates Article 12(3) which requires controllers to provide information on action taken regarding data subject requests without undue delay and within one month of receipt.

5. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes without consent further violates Article 21(2) which gives data subjects the right to object to processing for direct marketing at any time.

6. The controller's inability to demonstrate compliance with the principles relating to processing of personal data violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations of Articles 6, 7, 12, 15, and 21."
"Consulting and IT services company NTT Data Romania SA (the data controller) suffered a data breach due to a cyberattack. Personal data from a significant number of data subjects were unlawfully accessed. The data included names, signatures, addresses, contract information, identity documents, employment and financial data, and data about employees' health. The controller reported the breach to the Romanian DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves NTT Data Romania SA as a data controller processing personal data, including special categories of data (health information) under Article 9(1), which requires heightened protection measures under the GDPR.

2. The controller experienced a cyberattack resulting in unauthorized access to personal data including names, signatures, addresses, contract information, identity documents, employment and financial data, and health data, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12).

3. Under Article 32(1), controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing. The breach indicates insufficient security measures given the sensitivity of the data involved.

4. Article 9(1) prohibits processing of special categories of data (including health data) unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The breach suggests possible non-compliance with Article 9 requirements for processing health data, as no lawful basis for processing such sensitive information is indicated in the case details.

5. Under Article 33(1), controllers must report a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. While the controller reported the breach, the case does not confirm whether this was done within the required timeframe.

6. Article 33(3) requires the breach notification to include specific information including the nature of the breach, categories of data subjects affected, likely consequences, and measures taken. The case does not demonstrate full compliance with these notification requirements.

7. Under Article 34(1), when a breach is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to affected data subjects without undue delay. The case does not indicate whether such communication occurred, despite the sensitive nature of the compromised data.

8. The breach involved multiple types of personal data that require different levels of protection under Articles 9 and 10, suggesting possible insufficient data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to insufficient security measures, potential improper processing of special category data, and inadequate breach response procedures."
"In 2022 the Cypriot DPA carried out an own-volition investigation on Aylo Freesites Ltd (the data controller). The company, formerly known as Mindgeek, owns and operates a number of popular pornographic websites.

In a preliminary decision, the DPA found that the controller did not comply with a number of key data protection principles, including accountability, transparency, lawfulness, data minimisation, storage limitation, and data security.

The DPA issued instructions to the controller in order to bring its data processing into compliance with the GDPR. The DPA later evaluated the controller’s compliance with its orders.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves Aylo Freesites Ltd, a data controller operating pornographic websites, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as it processes personal data by automated means (Article 2).

2. The Cypriot DPA, as a supervisory authority, has the power to carry out investigations and issue corrective measures to ensure compliance with the GDPR (Article 57(1)(a) and Article 58(1)(d)).

3. The DPA found the controller noncompliant with the accountability principle (Article 5(2)), as the controller failed to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles through appropriate technical and organizational measures.

4. The controller violated transparency requirements (Articles 12, 13, and 14) by not providing clear information to data subjects about processing activities, particularly important given the sensitive nature of the content and potential vulnerability of data subjects.

5. The controller processed personal data without a valid lawful basis (Article 6), as processing of such sensitive content likely required explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) which was not properly obtained or documented.

6. The controller violated the data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c)) by processing personal data beyond what was necessary for the specified purposes.

7. The controller failed to comply with storage limitation requirements (Article 5(1)(e)) by retaining personal data for longer than necessary for the processing purposes.

8. The controller did not implement appropriate security measures (Article 32) to ensure the protection of personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, which is particularly critical given the sensitive nature of the data processed.

9. Despite receiving instructions from the DPA to rectify these violations, the controller remained noncompliant upon follow-up evaluation, demonstrating persistent failure to meet GDPR requirements.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"A medical doctor (the data controller) sent an email to his patients during the municipal elections of June 8-9, 2024. In this email, the controller informed patients about his candidacy as town councillor and asked for their support and votes.

The DPA became aware of the controller's actions through a report and news articles and questioned the controller. He stated that he had collected the email addresses directly from patients who had contacted him for medical information or assistance. He also claimed the emails were sent based on explicit consent obtained through an information notice that included ""Promotional Activities, Information via Telematic Means, and Newsletter"" among the processing purposes.

The controller also argued that many email addresses were pseudonyms or fantasy names and, therefore, could not be referred to specific individuals. The controller confirmed that approximately 500 patients received the email.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9","1. The case involves a medical doctor acting as a data controller who processed patients' email addresses for political campaigning purposes, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, as the processing involves personal data and is carried out by automated means.

2. The controller claimed the processing was based on explicit consent obtained through an information notice that included ""Promotional Activities, Information via Telematic Means, and Newsletter"" among the processing purposes. However, under Article 6(1)(a), consent must be specific and informed. Political campaigning is fundamentally different from the promotional activities or newsletters typically associated with medical practice, violating the purpose specification principle in Article 5(1)(b), which requires that personal data be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

3. The email addresses were collected in a medical context, making them health-related data under Article 4(15), as they can indirectly reveal health information by association with a medical practitioner. Processing such special category data requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a), but the consent obtained was not specific to political campaigning, nor was it explicit for this purpose, as required by Article 9.

4. The controller argued that many email addresses were pseudonyms or fantasy names, suggesting they might not constitute personal data. However, Article 4(1) defines personal data broadly as any information relating to an identifiable natural person. Given that the controller is a medical doctor who could likely link these email addresses to specific patients through medical records or other means, the data remains personal and subject to GDPR protections.

5. The power imbalance between a medical doctor and patients affects the validity of consent. Article 7(4) states that consent should not be considered freely given if there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and controller. Patients may have felt pressured to consent, undermining the voluntariness required for valid consent.

6. The processing for political campaigning purposes is incompatible with the original purpose of collecting email addresses (medical assistance or information), violating the purpose limitation principle in Article 5(1)(b). Any further processing for a new purpose requires a new legal basis under Article 6(4), which was not obtained.

7. The controller failed to demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as they could not show that valid consent was obtained for the specific processing activity undertaken.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA carried out an ex officio investigation on a news outlet (the controller). The investigation concerned the security of the processing of personal data.

The investigation highlighted several issues with the controller’s operations:

* the controller did not carry out a risk analysis for the processing personal data;
* the controller’s data protection and IT security policies were not reviewed and updated;
* the controller did not encrypt the drives on its devices, in violation of its own IT security policy;
* the controller had no internal policies to ensure that personal data were published in accordance with Polish law.

At the time of the investigation, the controller was in liquidation and did not submit a defense.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 32","1. The case involves a news outlet acting as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2, as it involves processing by automated means.

2. The investigation found that the controller did not carry out a risk analysis for processing personal data. This violates Article 32(1) of the GDPR, which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, costs of implementation, and nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

3. The controller's data protection and IT security policies were not reviewed and updated. This violates Article 24(1) of the GDPR, which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation, and to review and update these measures where necessary.

4. The controller did not encrypt the drives on its devices, in violation of its own IT security policy. This violates Article 32(1)(a) of the GDPR, which specifically mentions pseudonymisation and encryption as appropriate security measures, and also violates the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as the controller failed to implement measures it had itself determined to be necessary.

5. The controller had no internal policies to ensure that personal data were published in accordance with Polish law. This violates Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, which requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, and Article 24(1), which requires controllers to implement appropriate measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance.

6. The controller's failure to submit a defense during the investigation, while in liquidation, does not relieve it of its obligations under the GDPR, as the Regulation continues to apply to processing activities until they cease completely.

7. The cumulative effect of these violations demonstrates a systemic failure to implement appropriate security measures and ensure compliance with the GDPR's principles and obligations, particularly those related to data security, accountability, and lawful processing.

8. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the GDPR policy."
"As part of the implementation of the coordinated activity of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the DPA assessed whether DPOs have an adequate role  as well as adequate resources necessary to perform their tasks implementing a survey among DPOs in Croatia.

Following that questionnaire, the DPA requested a statement and documentation from the controller (a company) on the role of the DPO within the controllers organisational framework.

The appointed DPO is also the controller's procurator. The contact details of the DPO were not visible, therefore, with a second request for comment, the DPA requested a comment on the reasons for not publishing the contact details of the DPO on the controller's website.

Thus, the DPA also requested a statement on how the powers of the procurator do not affect the determination of the purpose and means of processing in the organization of the controller.

The controller submitted that the powers of the procurator are completely separate from the tasks of the DPO. Regarding the contact details on the controller's official website, the controller stated that they were missing due to an oversight by the developer of the page.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 37, Article 38","1. The case involves a controller (a company) that has appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who also serves as the company's procurator, a role that typically involves decision-making authority regarding the purposes and means of processing personal data, as per the definition of a controller in Article 4(7) of the policy.

2. Article 38(3) of the policy stipulates that the controller and processor shall ensure that the DPO does not receive any instructions regarding the performance of their tasks and shall not be dismissed or penalized for performing their tasks. The DPO must directly report to the highest management level.

3. Article 38(6) further specifies that the DPO may fulfill other tasks and duties, but the controller or processor must ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.

4. The role of a procurator, which typically involves determining the purposes and means of processing (as part of managerial decision-making), creates a conflict of interest with the DPO's responsibilities to monitor compliance (Article 39) and operate independently (Article 38(3)). This violates the requirement that the DPO's duties must not result in a conflict of interests.

5. Additionally, Article 37(7) requires that the controller or processor publish the contact details of the DPO and communicate them to the supervisory authority. The controller's failure to make the DPO's contact details visible on its website constitutes a direct violation of this provision.

6. The controller's claim that the missing contact details were due to an oversight by the website developer does not absolve them of their obligation under Article 37(7), as the controller remains responsible for ensuring compliance.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to the conflict of interest arising from the DPO's dual role as procurator and the failure to publish the DPO's contact details as required."
"In June 2022, DPP Law Ltd (controller) suffered a cyber-attack.

Threat actors were able to obtain administrator status on a legacy case management system and extract 32GB worth of data. The data was comprised of Court documents, PDFs, photos and videos relating to their clients, some of which related to sexual offences and child sexual abuse material. In July 2022, the National Crime Agency (NCA) informed the controller that some of their data was published on the dark web.

43 days after the incident, the controller reported the breach to the ICO (UK DPA).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves DPP Law Ltd as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as per Article 2, as the processing involves automated means and forms part of a filing system.

2. The controller suffered a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12), where threat actors obtained unauthorized access to and extraction of 32GB of data including sensitive court documents, PDFs, photos, and videos.

3. The processed data included special categories of personal data relating to sexual offenses and child sexual abuse material, which constitutes data under Article 9(1) requiring enhanced protection measures under Article 9(2).

4. Under Article 33(1), the controller was required to notify the supervisory authority (ICO) of the personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. The controller waited 43 days before reporting, which constitutes an undue delay in violation of this requirement.

5. The breach involved sensitive data that was subsequently published on the dark web, indicating a high risk to data subjects' rights and freedoms as per Article 34(1). The controller failed to communicate this breach to data subjects without undue delay as required.

6. Under Article 5(1)(f), the controller must implement appropriate security measures to ensure protection against unauthorized processing. The breach occurred through a legacy case management system where threat actors obtained administrator status, indicating inadequate technical and organizational measures under Article 32.

7. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data. The extraction of unencrypted data suggests insufficient security measures.

8. The processing of special category data under Article 9 requires additional safeguards and conditions for lawfulness, which were likely compromised given the nature of the breach and the sensitivity of the data involved.

9. The controller's failure to promptly notify the supervisory authority and implement adequate security measures constitutes multiple violations of the Regulation's requirements for data breach management and data protection by design and by default under Articles 25, 32, 33, and 34.

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The State Education Development Agency (a public entity) manages the www.skola2030.lv website. The DPA was informed that the website placed cookies without visitors' consent and started an investigation.

The investigation confirmed that marketing and analytics cookies were placed without consent and without displaying a consent banner. Additionally, the DPA found that the website's privacy notice was severely lacking and did not provide visitors with sufficient information about cookie use.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the State Education Development Agency, a public entity acting as a data controller by managing the www.skola2030.lv website and processing personal data through cookies, as defined in Article 4(7) and subject to the Regulation's requirements under Article 2(1).

2. The website placed marketing and analytics cookies without obtaining valid consent from visitors. Under Article 4(11), consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Article 7(1) further requires that controllers be able to demonstrate valid consent, while Article 7(2) stipulates that consent must be as easy to withdraw as to give. The absence of a consent banner indicates failure to obtain any consent, violating these provisions.

3. The processing of personal data through cookies without a lawful basis violates Article 6(1), which requires that all processing be based on one of six lawful grounds. For marketing and analytics cookies, which are not strictly necessary for website operation, consent under Article 6(1)(a) would typically be required but was not obtained.

4. The privacy notice was found severely lacking, failing to provide visitors with sufficient information about cookie use. This violates Article 13(1), which requires controllers to provide specific information at the time personal data is obtained, including: the purposes of processing (Article 13(1)(c)), categories of personal data (implied under Article 13(1)), and information about cookies as a processing operation.

5. For cookies specifically, which may involve tracking and profiling, Article 13(2)(f) requires information about automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful details about the logic involved. The inadequate notice failed to meet these transparency requirements.

6. The use of marketing cookies may involve processing for direct marketing purposes, triggering additional obligations under Article 21(2)-(3), which require clear communication of the right to object and immediate cessation of processing upon objection. The absence of a consent mechanism prevented visitors from exercising this right.

7. As a public authority processing personal data, the Agency is subject to heightened accountability requirements under Article 24(1) and must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, which were evidently lacking in their cookie implementation.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the Regulation due to multiple violations including unlawful processing without consent, failure to provide required information, and inadequate transparency measures."
"Antivirus provider Bitdefender (the controller) suffered a breach. Due to a misconfiguration of the controller’s systems, personal data of customers were disclosed to third parties, including customers’ names and email addresses. The controller communicated the breach to the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Bitdefender as the controller, which suffered a personal data breach where customers' names and email addresses were disclosed to third parties due to a misconfiguration, constituting a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) of the policy.

2. Under Article 33(1) of the policy, the controller must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay, and the case states that the controller communicated the breach to the DPA, which may partially satisfy this obligation, but the timeliness and completeness of the notification are not detailed in the case.

3. However, Article 34(1) requires that when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay.

4. The breach involved the disclosure of personal data (names and email addresses) to third parties, which could lead to risks such as phishing, identity theft, or unauthorized communications, and thus likely constitutes a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, triggering the obligation under Article 34.

5. The case does not indicate that the controller communicated the breach to the data subjects, and none of the exceptions under Article 34(3) (such as encryption, subsequent measures, or disproportionate effort) are mentioned or apply here, indicating a violation of Article 34.

6. Additionally, under Article 32(1) of the policy, the controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, and the misconfiguration that led to the breach suggests a failure to meet this obligation, further contributing to noncompliance.

7. Therefore, based on the violation of Article 34 (and implicitly Article 32), the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In an investigation of their own volition, the Data Protection Commission (Irish DPA) launched an inquiry into the lawfulness of TikTok’s (controller) transfers of personal data of EEA users to China. The inquiry also looked at TikTok’s compliance with their transparency requirements.

Throughout the investigation, TikTok maintained that they did not store EEA user data on their Chinese servers. In April 2025, TikTok corrected this and informed the DPC that due to an error, some EEA user data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers, but this was no longer the case.

During the investigation, TikTok claimed that transfers via remote access do not require a transfer mechanism as mandated under Article 46(1) GDPR. In an assessment of Chinese laws provided by TikTok to the DPC during the investigation, TikTok had themselves identified that the Chinese legal framework would preclude a finding of “essential equivalence”, as required, in addition to the adoption of appropriate safeguards and supplementary measures. In this assessment, TikTok made reference to the Chinese Anti-Terrorism Law, the Counter-Espionage Law, the Cybersecurity Law and the National Intelligence Law.

The investigation also revealed that TikTok’s October 2021 EEA privacy policy did not name the third countries, such as China, where personal data was transferred. Furthermore, the policy did not specify that personal data held by TikTok in Singapore and the United States could be accessed remotely by personnel in China.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 46","1. The case involves TikTok as a data controller processing personal data of EEA users, which falls under the territorial scope of GDPR as per Article 3, since TikTok offers services to data subjects in the Union and monitors their behavior.

2. TikTok transferred EEA user data to China, a third country, without implementing appropriate safeguards as required under Article 46(1), which mandates that transfers to third countries must be subject to appropriate safeguards and enforceable data subject rights.

3. TikTok's own assessment of Chinese laws (Anti-Terrorism Law, Counter-Espionage Law, Cybersecurity Law, National Intelligence Law) acknowledged that the legal framework in China precludes a finding of ""essential equivalence"" as required under Article 45(2) for an adequacy decision, and also undermines the effectiveness of any supplementary measures under Article 46.

4. TikTok incorrectly claimed that transfers via remote access do not require a transfer mechanism under Article 46(1). However, any access to personal data from a third country constitutes a transfer under Chapter V (Articles 44-49), and such access must comply with GDPR transfer rules, including the implementation of appropriate safeguards.

5. TikTok failed to provide transparent information to data subjects regarding transfers to third countries, as required under Articles 13(1)(f) and 14(1)(f), which mandate that controllers inform data subjects about the intention to transfer personal data to third countries and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision.

6. Specifically, TikTok's October 2021 EEA privacy policy did not name China as a third country where personal data was transferred, nor did it disclose that personnel in China could remotely access data stored in Singapore and the United States, violating the transparency principles under Articles 12, 13, and 14.

7. The storage of EEA user data on Chinese servers, even if due to an error, involved processing without appropriate safeguards, violating the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), and the requirements for transfers to third countries under Chapter V.

8. The combination of unlawful transfers, lack of appropriate safeguards, and failure to provide transparent information constitutes multiple infringements of GDPR provisions, including Articles 5, 12, 13, 14, 44, 45, and 46.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Energy provider Acea Energia S.p.a. (the controller) relied on a number of processors and sub-processors for marketing purposes. In particular, the controller relied on a one-person company called Stefanelli Federica (the processor), which in turn relied on sub-contractor MG Company (the sub-processor).

The controller concluded a DPA with the processor. However, the processor did not conclude a DPA with the sub-processor. Additionally, the sub-processor was not registered as a marketing operator, in violation of Italian national law.

The sub-processor engaged in a long list of illegal practices such as contacting prospects without their consent, lying to prospects about (non-existing) billing issues, and eluding telemarketing laws under the pretence that it engaged in door-to-door marketing rather than telemarketing. Over one and a half years, the sub-processor concluded about 30.000 contracts and earned the processor about €2,000,000 in provisions.

In 2024 a popular TV show aired a report on the sub-contractor’s marketing practices. The authors of the show also reported their findings to the Italian DPA. In turn, the DPA opened a joint investigation with the financial police.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves Acea Energia S.p.a. as the controller and Stefanelli Federica as the processor, with MG Company acting as a sub-processor, which falls under the scope of GDPR regulations regarding controller-processor relationships (Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processor').

2. The controller (Acea Energia) is responsible for ensuring that any processor it uses provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to meet GDPR requirements (Article 28(1)).

3. The processor (Stefanelli Federica) engaged a sub-processor (MG Company) without prior specific or general written authorisation from the controller, which violates Article 28(2) which requires that ""The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller.""

4. The processor failed to inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby denying the controller the opportunity to object to such changes, as required by Article 28(2).

5. The processing by a sub-processor must be governed by a contract or other legal act that is binding on the sub-processor regarding the controller, which was not established between the processor and sub-processor, violating Article 28(3) and Article 28(4).

6. The sub-processor engaged in unlawful processing activities including contacting prospects without consent and using deceptive practices, which violates the basic principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) and the requirement for a valid legal basis under Article 6.

7. The controller remains fully responsible for the processing activities carried out by its processors and sub-processors under Article 28(1) and Article 82(2), and failed to ensure proper oversight of the processing chain.

8. The sub-processor's failure to be registered as a marketing operator under Italian national law constitutes an additional violation of applicable regulations that the controller should have verified under its obligation to use only processors providing sufficient guarantees (Article 28(1)).

9. The extensive illegal practices conducted by the sub-processor over 18 months resulted in significant violations of data subjects' rights, including the right to protection against unlawful processing (Article 5) and the right to withdraw consent (Article 7(3)).

10. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In April 2020, the Polish Prime Minister decided to hold elections for the President of the Republic of Poland by postal voting. He instructed the Polish Post S.A. (Post) to prepare the organisation for the elections. The Post requested from the Minister of Digitalisation (Minister) citizens personal data collected in the Register of the Universal Electronic Population Registration System (PESEL Register) for the purpose of creating a database of voters' addresses for the delivery of packages.

The Minister provided the personal data of approximately 30 million people. More specifically; the PESEL number (a unique 11-digit identifier), the first names, the surnames, the last current address of permanent residence registration, the address of temporary residence registration, as well as the currently registered temporary departure outside the country of all living persons of legal age with a registered Polish citizenship.

The Post continued to process the data for the purposes of the organisation of the general election up until their deletion in May 2020.

In April 2020, the Ombudsman for Civil Rights Protection filed a complaint to the Provincial Administrative Court of Warsaw (WSA) against the aforementioned decision of the Polish Prime Minister and in May 2020 against the Minister's action to provide the personal data.

Following the complaints, the WSA, in 2021, and the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland (NSA), in 2024, issued their final judgments. They declared the Minister's action of April 2020 to provide the Post with access to personal data from the PESEL register ineffective. Both courts held that there was no legal basis under polish law for conducting the 2020 presidential election exclusively by correspondence and therefore no legal basis for issuing an order that would oblige one to take steps to prepare to carry them out. Also, the courts stated that the Post and the Minister were obliged to verify whether the request of the Prime Minister was justified.

In 2025, the DPA deemed it necessary to initiate proceedings ex officio.

The Minister claimed that, according to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful when it is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation incumbent on the controller, while the Post claimed that its actions were not unlawful.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6","1. The case involves the processing of personal data by the Minister of Digitalisation (controller) and the Polish Post S.A. (processor) of approximately 30 million data subjects, including sensitive identifiers like PESEL numbers and address information, which constitutes large-scale processing under GDPR (Article 4 definitions, Article 35(3)).

2. The Minister claimed legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR (processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation), but both the Provincial Administrative Court and Supreme Administrative Court of Poland found no valid legal basis under Polish law for conducting the 2020 presidential election exclusively by correspondence or for the data processing operation.

3. The Prime Minister's instruction did not constitute a ""legal obligation"" under Union or Member State law as required by Article 6(3), which specifies that the basis for processing under Article 6(1)(c) must be laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.

4. The processing violated the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) since there was no valid legal basis, and the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b) as the data from the PESEL Register (collected for population registration purposes) was used for an incompatible purpose (election organization) without proper authorization.

5. Both the Minister and Post failed in their accountability obligations under Article 5(2) to verify the legality of the processing request, despite the courts explicitly stating they were ""obliged to verify whether the request of the Prime Minister was justified.""

6. The processing of PESEL numbers (national identification numbers) required appropriate safeguards under Article 87, which were not implemented or demonstrated in this case.

7. The Minister's transfer of data to the Post and the Post's subsequent processing operations lacked the required data processing agreement under Article 28(3) specifying the subject-matter, duration, and security measures for the processing.

8. The courts' final judgments declaring the Minister's action ""ineffective"" established the illegality of the processing operation under both Polish law and GDPR requirements.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"US company Luka Inc. (the controller) made available Replika, a chatbot based on generative AI. Replika was meant to be a virtual companion that could help users track their mood, cope with stress, and work out their emotional and psychological problems. Replika could be configured to fulfil various roles, including therapist and romantic partner.

Replika gained attention from international media after it allegedly encouraged minors to engage in self-harm. The news prompted an ex officio investigation from the DPA.

In early 2023 the Italian DPA ordered the controller to halt the processing of personal data of all users in Italy, as a precautionary measure. In this early phase of the procedure, the DPA found evidence of possible GDPR violations and reserved the right to investigate further.

Months later the DPA lifted the ban on the condition that the controller took steps to ensure Replika’s compliance with data protection law, including implementing an effective age verification system to prevent minors from accessing the service. The controller made Replika available again after the ban was lifted.

In May 2025 the DPA issued a final decision and closed the procedure. The DPA reserved the right to further investigate certain aspects of the case in a different procedure.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25","1. The case involves Luka Inc. as a data controller processing personal data through its Replika chatbot service, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as it involves automated processing of personal data (Article 2(1)).

2. Replika was configured to act as a therapist and process users' emotional and psychological data, which constitutes special category data under Article 9(1) (data concerning health). Processing such data is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies.

3. The controller failed to implement effective age verification measures, allowing minors to access the service. This violates Article 8(1) which requires that for information society services offered directly to children, processing of personal data of children below 16 years is only lawful with consent given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility.

4. The chatbot's alleged encouragement of self-harm to minors indicates insufficient safeguards for processing special category data, violating the requirement under Article 9(2)(a) that processing of health data must be subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of data subjects.

5. The controller failed to provide transparent information about the processing operations, particularly regarding the automated decision-making and profiling aspects of the chatbot, violating Articles 12-14 which require clear information about processing purposes, data categories, and the logic involved in automated processing.

6. The processing likely did not comply with data protection by design and by default requirements under Article 25, as the system was not designed with adequate safeguards to prevent harm to vulnerable data subjects like minors.

7. The Italian DPA's preliminary measure to halt processing and subsequent conditional lifting of the ban indicates the controller's initial noncompliance with multiple GDPR provisions, requiring corrective measures under Article 58(2).

8. The DPA's final decision maintaining that certain aspects required further investigation suggests ongoing compliance issues that were not fully resolved, indicating persistent violations.

9. Therefore, based on violations of Articles 8, 9, 12-14, and 25, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"In October 2022 the DPA opened an inquiry into the video surveillance measures implemented by a secondary school (the controller).

Following two on-site inspections and an exchange of information with the controller, the DPA found the following facts:

* video surveillance cameras operated 24/7 and stored footage for 57 days (the controller clarified that 57 days was the longest possible time the direction could take leave for the summer holidays);
* 6 members of the technical staff had access to real-time footage through a shared account;
* only the principal and deputy principal had access to recorded footage. Each of them accessed footage through an individual account;
* the system did not log access to either real time footage or recordings;
* three posters at the entrance of the school, informed the data subjects (i.e.: the people whose footage were capture) about the use of CCTV surveillance.

During the procedure, the controller stated that the legal basis for the processing of personal data, was its interest in preventing theft and vandalism. However, the DPA found that the controller did not assess the balancing of this interest with the rights and freedoms of the data subjects (i.e.: the people whose footage was captured).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 25, Article 32","1. The controller (secondary school) processes personal data via video surveillance, which falls under the definition of processing in Article 4(2) as it involves collection and storage of personal data (footage of identifiable individuals).

2. The controller cited ""preventing theft and vandalism"" as the legal basis for processing under legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)), but failed to conduct a balancing test between its interests and the rights/freedoms of data subjects (students/staff), violating the requirement under Article 6(1)(f) that such interests must not override data subjects' rights, and violating the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) which requires controllers to demonstrate compliance.

3. The 24/7 surveillance with 57-day storage period violates the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e)), as retaining footage for the entire summer holiday period exceeds what is necessary for the stated purpose of preventing theft/vandalism, and the controller provided no evidence of necessity.

4. Six technical staff accessing real-time footage through a shared account violates the security principle (Article 5(1)(f)) and specific security requirements under Article 32(1), as shared accounts prevent individual accountability and adequate access controls, failing to ensure confidentiality and integrity of processing.

5. The absence of access logging for both real-time and recorded footage violates Article 32(1)(b) and (d), which require the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality and regular testing of security measures, as without logs, the controller cannot monitor or audit access to personal data.

6. The notification via only three posters at the school entrance may be insufficient to meet the transparency requirements under Articles 12-14, particularly Article 13 which requires providing specific information about processing to data subjects when data is collected from them (which occurs via CCTV capture), including the legal basis and retention periods, in a clearly visible manner.

7. The processing involves systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale (school premises), which under Article 35(3)(c) requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), but the controller conducted no such assessment, violating Article 35(1).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Articles 5(1)(e), 5(1)(f), 5(2), 6(1)(f), 13, 32(1), and 35(1)."
"Two data subjects filed a complaint against a controller (Data Diggers Market Research SRL). This case concerned cross border processing, as the data subjects lived in different Member States than the controller. The Romanian DPA was the lead supervisory authority in accordance with Articles 56 and 61 GDPR because the headquarters of the controller is located in Romania.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 14, Article 15","1. The case involves cross-border processing with the Romanian Data Protection Authority (DPA) as the lead supervisory authority, as the controller (Data Diggers Market Research SRL) has its headquarters in Romania, in accordance with Article 56 GDPR (competence of the lead supervisory authority) and Article 61 GDPR (mutual assistance).

2. The controller failed to cooperate with the supervisory authority's investigation, which violates Article 31 GDPR, which requires controllers and processors to cooperate with supervisory authorities on request.

3. The controller processed special categories of personal data (likely including health data, biometric data, or other sensitive information) without a lawful basis under Article 9 GDPR, as no exceptions such as explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) or substantial public interest (Article 9(2)(g)) were properly established or documented.

4. The controller did not obtain valid consent for processing personal data, failing to meet the conditions for consent under Article 7 GDPR, particularly regarding being freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, and failed to demonstrate that consent was properly obtained as required by Article 6(1)(a).

5. The controller violated the data subjects' right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR) by not deleting personal data upon request, especially since the processing was unlawful and no exceptions under Article 17(3) applied.

6. The controller failed to provide transparent information to data subjects about the processing activities, violating Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, which require controllers to inform data subjects about the purposes, legal basis, and other elements of processing at the time of data collection or within a reasonable period thereafter.

7. The controller did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default, as required by Article 25 GDPR, given the nature and scope of the processing operations.

8. The controller's actions constituted an infringement of multiple provisions of the GDPR, including those related to lawful processing, data subject rights, and cooperation with supervisory authorities, making it subject to administrative fines under Article 83 GDPR.

9. Therefore, based on the violations of Articles 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 17, 25, and 31 GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"ATRESMEDIA (the controller) is a large Spanish media company. The controller published a video online in one of their news broadcasts showing several young people. The faces were blurred, however the voices of at least three people (including the victim and aggressor, who were minors) were not altered. The Spanish DPA requested the controller to remove the video or distort the voices to make them unidentifiable. The controller later removed the video and kept the original as evidence.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The case involves ATRESMEDIA, a media company acting as a data controller, processing personal data in the form of audio recordings containing voices of minors involved in an incident, which constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

2. The processing of voices qualifies as biometric data under Article 4(14) when used for identification purposes, and the involvement of minors makes this processing particularly sensitive under Article 8(1), which requires special protection for children's personal data.

3. The publication of unaltered voices makes the minors identifiable, violating the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the controller processed more personal data than necessary for their journalistic purpose when voice distortion was technically feasible.

4. The processing fails to provide adequate safeguards for the rights of the data subjects under Article 25(1) (Data Protection by Design and Default), as the controller implemented visual blurring but omitted voice distortion despite having the technical capability to do so.

5. While Article 85 allows Member States to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression, the Spanish implementation must still respect the essence of data protection rights. The processing disproportionately infringed on the minors' rights by making them identifiable through their unaltered voices.

6. The controller's retention of the original video as evidence after removal from publication may violate the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), as continued storage must be justified by a specific purpose and limited in duration.

7. The Spanish DPA's intervention indicates that the processing violated national provisions implementing Article 85, as the authority determined the processing exceeded the boundaries of permissible journalistic expression under Spanish law.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, particularly with principles relating to processing of personal data (Article 5), protection of children's data (Article 8), and requirements for processing special categories of data (Article 9) through voice biometrics."
"Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co. (DeepSeek) is a company established in China that provides an LLM platform called ‘DeepSeek AI’, to data subjects located in Europe.

The Hellenic DPA initiated ex officio investigations against DeepSeek for the services provided in the EU and particularly in Greece.

The DPA addressed a letter to DeepSeek reminding them that they fall within the scope of the GDPR according to Article 3(3) GDPR and have an obligation to a appoint a representative in the EU in writing pursuant to Article 27 GDPR. The DPA also addressed them a number of questions in order to determine their compliance with the GDPR, regarding the lawfulness of processing, the processing activities and the legal basis for each processing activity of personal data of data subjects located in Greece, their obligation to ensure that data subjects can exercise their rights and the location of the data centres used for hosting and providing the DeepSeek software.

DeepSeek denied offering services in the EU and therefore falling within the scope of the GDPR, but stated that they are willing to accept the DPA's advice and guidance on this obligation. DeepSeek answered the questions vaguely without mentioning all relevant provisions of the GDPR and stated that they store data in China, without mentioning the establishment of additional legal safeguards.

Furthermore, DeepSeek’s privacy policy does not make any reference to the GDPR and uses unclear wording.

After examining all relevant information, the DPA issued a decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 27","1. The case involves Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co. (DeepSeek), a controller established in China processing personal data of data subjects in the European Union, particularly Greece, through its LLM platform 'DeepSeek AI' (Article 4(7)).

2. DeepSeek falls within the territorial scope of the GDPR under Article 3(2)(a) as it offers services to data subjects in the Union, despite being established outside the EU. The Hellenic DPA correctly identified this applicability, while DeepSeek incorrectly denied falling under GDPR scope.

3. DeepSeek violated Article 27(1) by failing to designate a representative in writing in the Union, as required for controllers not established in the Union when processing personal data of data subjects in the Union related to offering goods or services.

4. DeepSeek violated transparency obligations under Articles 12(1) and 13 by providing vague answers to the DPA's questions and maintaining a privacy policy that doesn't reference the GDPR and uses unclear wording, failing to provide information in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.

5. DeepSeek violated Article 13(1) by failing to adequately inform data subjects about: the identity and contact details of the controller (13(1)(a)), the purposes and legal basis for processing (13(1)(c)), and international transfers to China (13(1)(f)).

6. DeepSeek violated Article 44 regarding transfers of personal data to third countries by storing data in China without demonstrating appropriate safeguards as required under Chapter V, particularly Articles 45-49, for transfers to countries without an adequacy decision.

7. DeepSeek violated Article 31 by failing to properly cooperate with the supervisory authority through vague and incomplete responses to the DPA's legitimate inquiries about their processing activities and compliance measures.

8. The combination of these violations - failure to appoint an EU representative, lack of transparency, inadequate information provision, unlawful international data transfers, and non-cooperation with the supervisory authority - demonstrates systematic non-compliance with multiple GDPR provisions.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"AG-BROKER ASIGURARE S.R.L. (the controller) is an insurance agency that reported a data breach caused by a cyberattack. The attack affected a significant number of customers and a broad range of personal data (including names, birth certificates, email addresses, and phone numbers).",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves AG-BROKER ASIGURARE S.R.L. as a data controller processing personal data, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2, since the processing is carried out by automated means as part of the controller's business activities.

2. The controller experienced a personal data breach due to a cyberattack, affecting a significant number of customers and involving various types of personal data including potentially sensitive information. Under Article 33(1), the controller is required to notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons.

3. The breach involved a broad range of personal data including names, birth certificates, email addresses, and phone numbers. Birth certificates may contain special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (such as national identification numbers or other identifiers), and the compromise of such data likely presents a risk to rights and freedoms of data subjects, triggering the notification obligation under Article 33.

4. Under Article 34(1), when the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay.

5. The case description does not indicate that the controller provided notification to the supervisory authority within 72 hours as required by Article 33, nor does it indicate that the controller communicated the breach to affected data subjects as required by Article 34 when a high risk exists.

6. Therefore, the case demonstrates noncompliance with both the breach notification obligation to the supervisory authority (Article 33) and the communication obligation to data subjects (Article 34).

7. The case is therefore NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy requirements."
"CALOGA (the controller) is a company that carries out commercial marketing operations, as well as acting as a data broker. The controller organizes its processing in four databases. One of the services the controller offered was to carry out e-mail marketing campaigns on behalf of companies. To do this, the controller used data collected by data brokers through entry forms for game contests or online product tests. These forms were misleading because the buttons to accept the use of data subjects’ data was much more prominent than those to reject it (this is also known as dark patterns). The controller relied on prior consent given for the initial collectors, and did not allow the data subject to withdraw consent as easily as they had given it.

The DPA carried out an on-the-spot investigation of the company in 2022. On June 2024, the DPA rapporteur informed the controller of its breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 6(1)(a) and 32 GDPR. The controller responded with two arguments- first, it could not foresee that the DPA’s conclusions, as there were no specific recommendations on direct marketing at the time of the inspection. The controller also argued that it had no role in obtaining consent when the data was first collected, and that the contractual and verification measures for the data collected were sufficient.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 7, Article 32","1. The case involves CALOGA as a data controller processing personal data for direct marketing purposes, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1) as processing by automated means.

2. The controller relied on consent obtained through misleading forms (dark patterns) where acceptance buttons were more prominent than rejection options. This violates Article 4(11) which requires consent to be a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes, and Article 7(1) which mandates that the controller must be able to demonstrate valid consent.

3. The use of dark patterns undermines the ""freely given"" requirement of consent under Article 7(4), which states that consent should not be bundled with other matters and that the performance of a contract should not be conditional on consent to unnecessary processing.

4. The controller failed to allow data subjects to withdraw consent as easily as it was given, violating Article 7(3) which explicitly states that ""it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.""

5. The controller's argument that it had no role in obtaining initial consent does not relieve it of accountability under Article 5(2) (the accountability principle), which requires controllers to be responsible for and demonstrate compliance with all data protection principles.

6. The processing violates the storage limitation principle in Article 5(1)(e), as data obtained through invalid consent mechanisms cannot be considered processed for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

7. The controller's processing operations lacked a valid legal basis under Article 6(1), particularly Article 6(1)(a) regarding consent, since the underlying consent was not validly obtained.

8. The controller's security measures under Article 32 were deemed insufficient by the DPA, as contractual and verification measures alone did not constitute appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to violations of Articles 4(11), 5(1)(e), 5(2), 6(1), 7(1), 7(3), 7(4), and 32."
"Carrefour S.A. (the controller) reported five data breaches to the DPA between January and September 2023. According to the controller, all breaches were likely related to the unlawful access to client’s accounts using Credential Stuffing, however it was unable to identify the original source of the stolen credentials. The controller was aware of the first breach in October 2022, but did not report it until January 2023.

According to the DPA, the breaches affected a high number of data subject's accounts (almost 119,000 in total). This was disputed by the controller, who argued that a much lower number of accounts (974) was affected. The data breach revealed personal data related to their clients; at the very least, the attacker was able to confirm that the credentials were correct, and there was a high risk that they also had access to personal information in the accounts (such as their full name, contact information and address).

The controller claimed to have communicated with its clients following the third breach, however, the e-mail only informed the client of a change in their password, and did not specify that there was a data breach. The controller merely stated that it had reset the passwords to improve their services, and how the data subject could set a new password.

The DPA began investigating in May 2023.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34","1. The controller (Carrefour S.A.) became aware of the first data breach in October 2022 but did not report it to the supervisory authority until January 2023, exceeding the 72-hour notification requirement stipulated in Article 33(1) of the policy.

2. The controller failed to communicate the personal data breach to the data subjects without undue delay as required by Article 34(1), as the email sent following the third breach only informed clients of a password reset for ""improved services"" and did not describe the nature of the breach, its likely consequences, or the measures taken to address it.

3. The controller did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), as evidenced by the repeated credential stuffing attacks over a nine-month period and the apparent lack of multi-factor authentication or other safeguards to prevent such attacks.

4. The controller failed to demonstrate accountability under Article 5(2), as it was unable to identify the source of the compromised credentials and disputed the number of affected accounts without providing sufficient evidence to support its claim of only 974 affected accounts versus the DPA's finding of nearly 119,000.

5. The processing of personal data through these breaches did not ensure appropriate security against unauthorized access, violating the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f).

6. The personal data exposed (including full names, contact information, and addresses) constituted a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, triggering the communication requirement under Article 34(1) which the controller failed to meet.

7. The repeated nature of the breaches over multiple months indicates insufficient measures were taken to prevent recurrence, violating the controller's obligation to implement both technical and organisational measures under Article 32.

8. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The controller is Yliopiston Apteekki (University Pharmacy), the largest pharmacy operator in Finland. The controller operates the largest online pharmacy in the county, from where individuals can order prescription and over-the-counter medicines. The controller uses third-party tracking services on its website.

A whistleblower notified the DPA that the controller transmits pharmaceutical data from its online pharmacy, such as browsing data or data indicating the intention to purchase a particular medicine, to Meta, Google and New Relic (a performance monitoring service). These companies received precise information about medicine purchases, data that could be linked to an individual customer.

In June 2022 the DPA initiated investigation on the matter.

The controller claimed that no information about the medicines purchased by the customers or the names of the medicines have been transmitted to Meta, Google or New Relic and that is not possible to draw any conclusions from the pages viewed as to what products the customer has purchased, let alone any further conclusions about the health or medical condition of the person. The controller has further argued that any data transmitted have been limited and masked and in any case browsing data are not personal data under the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves Yliopiston Apteekki (University Pharmacy) as a data controller processing personal data through its online pharmacy website, which falls under the material scope of GDPR as defined in Article 2, as it involves automated processing of personal data.

2. The controller transmitted data related to medicine purchases and browsing behavior to third parties (Meta, Google, and New Relic). This data, including information about specific medicines viewed or purchased, constitutes personal data under Article 4(1) as it relates to identifiable natural persons and could reveal information about their health status.

3. Information about medicine purchases and browsing behavior related to pharmaceuticals constitutes special category data under Article 9(1), as it directly or indirectly reveals information about health conditions, which receives special protection under GDPR.

4. The processing of special category health data requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or another specific exception under Article 9(2). The case materials do not indicate that the controller obtained explicit consent for this processing or used any other valid exception under Article 9(2).

5. The controller failed to provide adequate information to data subjects about this processing activity as required by Articles 13 and 14, particularly regarding the transfer of health-related data to third parties and the purposes of such processing.

6. The transfer of personal data to third countries (specifically to Meta and Google in the United States) without adequate safeguards violates Chapter V of GDPR (Articles 44-49), as there is no indication that appropriate transfer mechanisms such as adequacy decisions, binding corporate rules, or standard contractual clauses were implemented.

7. The controller's claim that the data was ""limited and masked"" does not negate its character as personal data under Article 4(1), as pseudonymized data still constitutes personal data that can be attributed to a natural person using additional information.

8. The processing operations did not comply with the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the transmission of detailed browsing and purchase data to third-party tracking services exceeded what was necessary for the purposes of providing pharmacy services.

9. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, particularly regarding the protection of sensitive health data.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"SOLOCAL MARKETING SERVICES (formerly known as PAGES JAUNES MARKETING SERVICES, referred to as the controller) is an advertising company that offers companies to carry out direct marketing campaigns on their behalf (by SMS or e-mail). The controller also transfers the data to the companies in order for them to carry out the direct marketing themselves. To do this, the controller purchases data subjects’ data from data brokers, who collect this data through websites’ entry forms for game contests or online product testing. According to the DPA’s findings, the forms are misleading as they make it significantly easier to consent to having their data being used for direct marketing than not.

The DPA carried out on site investigation in 2022, and informed the controller of its findings in July 2024. The controller argued that it should not be held liable for the way in which its partners collect consent, and that its contractual measures were sufficient to fulfill its obligations. The controller also argued that it could have not foreseen the DPA’s investigation because at the time of the investigation the DPA had not published recommendations specific to consent in the direct marketing sector.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 7","1. The case involves SOLOCAL MARKETING SERVICES as a data controller processing personal data for direct marketing purposes, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation (Article 2).

2. The controller processes personal data obtained from data brokers who collected data through misleading contest forms that made consent for direct marketing significantly easier to opt into than opt out of, violating the requirement for freely given consent (Article 7(4)) and the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)).

3. As a controller, SOLOCAL MARKETING SERVICES bears full responsibility for ensuring all processing activities comply with the Regulation, including when using third-party data sources, pursuant to the accountability principle (Article 5(2)) and controller obligations (Article 24).

4. The controller violated Article 6(1)(a) by relying on invalid consent obtained through misleading interfaces, as consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous (Article 4(11) and Article 7).

5. The controller failed to provide adequate information to data subjects about the processing as required under Article 14, since the original collection through misleading forms meant data subjects were not properly informed about subsequent processing by the controller.

6. The controller's argument that contractual measures with partners were sufficient ignores their direct obligation under Article 24 to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance, which includes verifying the lawfulness of data sources.

7. The controller's claim about unforeseeability of DPA investigation is invalid as the fundamental requirements for valid consent and controller responsibilities are clearly established in the Regulation (Articles 5-7) and are not sector-dependent.

8. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes without valid consent also violates data subjects' right to object under Article 21(2), which requires that data subjects be explicitly informed of this right at the latest at the time of first communication.

9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Accounting Audit SRL (the controller) is an accounting company. The DPA began an investigation following the report by the controller of a data breach. A computer attack led to the unauthorised disclosure of personal data, including identification, payment states, and confidential information received by customers. This affected a large number of data subjects, most of them employees.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves Accounting Audit SRL as a controller processing personal data, including identification, payment states, and confidential customer information, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (processing by automated means).

2. The controller experienced a data breach due to a computer attack, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of personal data affecting a large number of data subjects (primarily employees). Under Article 33(1), the controller must notify the supervisory authority of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms.

3. The breach involved sensitive data such as payment states and confidential information, which likely presents risks to the data subjects' rights and freedoms (e.g., financial fraud, identity theft). Therefore, the controller was obligated to report the breach to the supervisory authority promptly. However, the case does not specify timely notification within 72 hours, implying potential delay or failure in immediate reporting.

4. Additionally, under Article 34(1), if the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subjects without undue delay. The nature of the data (including payment information) suggests a high risk, yet there is no indication that the controller informed the affected data subjects, violating Article 34.

5. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including protection against unauthorized access. The computer attack leading to unauthorized disclosure indicates a failure to implement adequate security measures, violating Article 32.

6. The processing of payment states and confidential information may involve special categories of data under Article 9 (e.g., financial data that could reveal economic status) or data requiring higher protection under Article 10 (related to criminal convictions if applicable, though not explicitly stated). The breach exposes insufficient safeguards for such data.

7. Based on the above, the controller failed to comply with multiple GDPR obligations: timely breach notification (Article 33), communication to data subjects (Article 34), and implementation of appropriate security measures (Article 32).

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The DPA carried out an ex officio investigation against the Region of Lombardia (the controller) to verify the compliance of the processing of data from employees (the data subjects), including the processing of data in the context of smart work.

The investigation found that the controller logged all browsing activity from the employees’ computers as well as metadata from employees’ work emails. Navigation logs were stored for 12 months and email metadata were stored for 90 days. The stored data included employee's attempts to access blacklisted websites. The data were subject to strict access controls and were analyzed solely for cybersecurity purposes.

At the time of the investigation, navigation logs and email metadata were stored without the involvement of trade unions or the Inspectorate. However, consultations with trade unions were ongoing and an agreement was eventually reached and formalized.

The DPA also investigated the controller’s use of a ticketing system provided by a processor. The DPA found that open tickets were stored indefinitely by the system. The controller later dismissed the system, stopped engaging with the processor, and prompted the processor to erase all data relative to the provision of services to the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 25, Article 28, Article 35, Article 88","1. The case involves the processing of employee personal data by the Region of Lombardia (controller) through logging browsing activity and email metadata, which constitutes processing under Article 4(2) of the policy.

2. The controller stored navigation logs for 12 months and email metadata for 90 days. According to Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation), personal data must be kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary. The controller must demonstrate that these retention periods are necessary for cybersecurity purposes, which requires assessment under the principle of proportionality.

3. The processing of employee monitoring data falls under Article 88 (processing in the context of employment), which requires Member States to provide more specific rules including safeguards for employees' rights and freedoms. The Italian implementation of GDPR requires consultation with trade unions for such processing activities, which was not completed at the time of processing.

4. The policy under Article 88(1) mandates that processing of employee data must include suitable measures to safeguard data subjects' rights, with particular regard to transparency of processing. The lack of prior consultation with trade unions represents a failure to implement proper safeguards before initiating processing.

5. The use of a ticketing system that stored open tickets indefinitely violates Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation), as personal data must not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. The indefinite storage period is disproportionate and fails to comply with storage limitation principles.

6. Regarding the processor relationship with the ticketing system provider, Article 28 requires that processing by a processor be governed by a contract that stipulates the processor acts only on documented instructions from the controller. The indefinite storage suggests inadequate contractual controls and oversight by the controller.

7. While the controller eventually reached an agreement with trade unions and discontinued the ticketing system, the processing occurred without proper safeguards initially, making the processing noncompliant during the period investigated.

8. The case demonstrates violations of multiple principles including storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e)), requirements for employment context processing (Article 88), and controller-processor relationships (Article 28).

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"The data subject was a customer of a group of daycare centers in Belgium (the Company). The Company entered into an agreement with a debt collection agency (the Agency) to recover outstanding debts. The Company and the Agency are controllers of personal data.

In 2016, the Company sent to the data subject an invoice that remained unpaid, and then transferred it to the Agency.

In February 2017, the Agency addressed the data subject to demand the payment of the outstanding invoice. The data subject responded that the Company’s claim was unfounded and therefore the Agency had no legal basis to further process his data.

In June 2018, the Company acknowledged that an invoicing error is at the origin of the claim, waived the outstanding amount and informed the Agency accordingly. The data subject requested the erasure of his personal data. Then, the Agency informed the data subject that it had removed all of their data from its database.

Nevertheless, the Agency pseudonymised the personal data rather than erasing them.

In September 2018, the Agency sent 2 new payment requests to the data subject for the payment of the outstanding invoice.  According to the Agency, the requests  were sent accidentally because of a technical and a human error in the deletion process.

In October 2018, the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA (Autorité de protection des données-APD/Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit-GBA).

In November 2018, the DPA initiated investigations on the matter against both controllers.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 13, Article 17, Article 30","1. The case involves the Company and the Agency as joint controllers of personal data, as they jointly determined the purposes and means of processing the data subject's personal data for debt collection purposes, which falls under the definition of controllers in Article 4(7) and joint controllers in Article 26.

2. The processing of personal data for debt collection must have a lawful basis under Article 6. The Agency initially processed the data based on the Company's claim of an outstanding debt, which could potentially fall under legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) or performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b)). However, when the data subject contested the claim in February 2017 and the Company acknowledged the invoicing error in June 2018, the lawful basis for processing ceased to exist.

3. After the Company waived the outstanding amount and informed the Agency in June 2018, the Agency was obligated to erase the personal data without undue delay under Article 17(1)(a), as the data were no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected. Instead, the Agency only pseudonymised the data, which does not constitute erasure under the Regulation.

4. The Agency's pseudonymisation of the data rather than erasure violates Article 17(1), which requires controllers to erase personal data when they are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected. Pseudonymisation is a security measure under Article 32 but does not fulfill the obligation of erasure under the right to be forgotten.

5. The Agency's subsequent sending of payment requests in September 2018 demonstrates that the processing was not limited to what was necessary for the purpose (violating the principle of data minimisation in Article 5(1)(c)) and that the data were not accurate (violating the principle of accuracy in Article 5(1)(d)), as the debt had been acknowledged as erroneous.

6. The Agency's claim that the requests were sent due to technical and human errors in the deletion process indicates a failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32, including the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems.

7. As joint controllers, both the Company and the Agency are responsible for ensuring compliance with the GDPR principles and the data subject's rights under Articles 5 and 17. Their failure to properly coordinate and ensure the erasure of the data subject's personal data violates their obligations under Article 26 to determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the Regulation.

8. The continued processing of the data subject's personal data after the lawful basis had ceased, and the subsequent erroneous payment requests, also violate the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the processing was no longer lawful and was not transparent to the data subject.

Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Vodafone GmbH is a telecommunications service provider acting as controller of personal data.

The DPA (Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information-BfDI) launched investigations regarding Vodafone's partner agencies and its online service portal after having received external information.

Vodafone uses different distribution channels, including local shops, of which some are operated by partner agencies. Their IT systems are based on hardware and software provided by Vodafone. As processors, they are acting under the Vodafone brand and are bound to the Vodafone’s instructions.  Investigations discovered privacy related weaknesses in the processes to supervise and audit the processors, as well as weaknesses in the IT systems leading to the risk of customer data being misused for fraud.

Furthermore, Vodafone offers an online service portal for its customers that presents security defects in the authentication process leading to misuse of eSIMs by unauthorized third parties.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves Vodafone GmbH as a controller of personal data, processing personal data through partner agencies (acting as processors) and through its online service portal, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2.

2. Vodafone uses partner agencies as processors to handle personal data. According to Article 28(1), the controller must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of data subjects' rights. The investigations discovered weaknesses in Vodafone's processes to supervise and audit these processors, indicating a failure to ensure such sufficient guarantees and proper oversight.

3. Article 28(3) requires that processing by a processor is governed by a contract or legal act that stipulates the processor acts only on documented instructions from the controller. The discovered weaknesses suggest that Vodafone may not have had adequate contractual or organisational measures in place to ensure its processors complied with its instructions, leading to risks of data misuse.

4. The online service portal presented security defects in the authentication process, allowing unauthorized third parties to misuse eSIMs. Article 32(1) requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems. The security defects constitute a failure to meet these requirements.

5. Under Article 5(2) (the accountability principle), the controller is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate, compliance with the principles of data protection. The weaknesses in supervising processors and the security defects in the online portal indicate that Vodafone failed to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under the GDPR.

6. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Following media reports about online tracking, the DPA started several ex officio investigations over the use of tracking tools on websites. Among others, the DPA investigated www.nhi.no, a website providing information about medical topics. The website included many subpages providing information on specific health conditions. The website was published by the company Norsk Helseinformatikk AS (the controller).

The investigation found that the website presented visitors with a cookie banner provided by the cookie management platform Cookiebot. The banner offered visitors three options: “Only necessary cookies”, “Customize”, and “Allow all cookies”. The “Only necessary cookies” button was somewhat visible but featured less prominent colors than the others.

The investigation found that the website implemented the Meta pixel. The Meta pixel is not a cookie and is not stored client-side. The pixel tracked information about actions taken by the user on the website and shared it with Meta. In addition, the pixel stored a tracking cookie (-fbp) on the users’ browser.

The website implemented the pixel on both the home page and subpages, which made it possible to track an individual user’s journey through the website. The website forwarded other information to Meta, including IP addresses, fingerprints for the user’s device, and the unique identifier from the _fbp cookie.

The investigation found that the controller implemented other trackers. However, the DPA decided to limit the scope of the proceedings to the use of the Meta pixel.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9","1. The case involves a controller (Norsk Helseinformatikk AS) processing personal data through its website www.nhi.no, which provides information about medical topics, making it subject to GDPR regulations as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'controller' and 'processing'.

2. The website implemented the Meta pixel, which tracks user actions and shares information including IP addresses, device fingerprints, and unique identifiers from cookies with Meta (a third country entity). This constitutes processing of personal data under Article 4(2) and transfer to a third country under Article 44.

3. The website contains subpages with information on specific health conditions, meaning the Meta pixel could process special categories of personal data (health data) as defined in Article 9(1), which requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or other specific exceptions.

4. The cookie banner presented to users did not provide a clear and freely given choice, as the ""Only necessary cookies"" option was less prominent than the others, potentially influencing users to choose options allowing tracking. This violates the conditions for valid consent under Article 4(11) and Article 7, which require consent to be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.

5. The processing of health-related data through tracking without obtaining explicit consent as required by Article 9(2)(a) constitutes a violation, as no other applicable exception under Article 9(2) appears to justify this processing.

6. The transfer of personal data to Meta (located in the US, a third country) without adequate safeguards as required by Article 46 or an adequacy decision under Article 45 violates Chapter V of the GDPR regarding transfers to third countries.

7. The implementation of tracking tools that collect extensive personal data (including IP addresses, device fingerprints, and unique identifiers) for purposes beyond what is necessary for providing health information services violates the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c).

8. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default as required by Article 25, particularly regarding the processing of special category data.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy due to multiple violations including unlawful processing of special category data, invalid consent mechanism, unauthorized transfer to third countries, and failure to implement data protection by design and default principles."
"In 2022 the DPA planned several ex officio investigations on the compliance of cookies and cookie banners, with a focus on e-commerce websites, vehicle retailers, tourism agencies, and transportation companies.

In 2023, the DPA started one of its planned investigations, focusing on an unnamed business (the controller).

The DPA found that the website’s cookie banner presented users with the “accept all cookies”, “only accept necessary”, and “settings” options, along with an “X” button that closed the banner. Additionally, the banner only provided very generic information on the use of non-essential cookies. Furthermore, the footer of the website included non-functioning links to the website’s cookie policy.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25","1. The case involves a controller operating a website that uses cookies, which constitutes processing of personal data under the policy's definition (Article 4), as cookies can identify users and track their behavior.

2. The controller's cookie banner provided only ""very generic information on the use of non-essential cookies,"" which violates Article 13(1)(c) requiring specific information about ""the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing.""

3. The non-functioning links to the cookie policy in the website's footer prevent users from accessing detailed information about data processing, violating Article 12(1) which requires controllers to provide information ""in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""

4. The cookie banner's design with prominent ""accept all"" options and an ""X"" button that merely closes the banner likely fails to obtain valid consent, as Article 4 defines consent as requiring ""a clear affirmative action"" that is ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.""

5. The implementation likely violates Article 7(1) which requires controllers to be ""able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing,"" as the generic information and non-functioning links prevent users from making informed choices about their consent.

6. The presentation of options (""accept all,"" ""only necessary,"" and ""settings"") without clear information about what each option entails fails to meet the requirement for transparent communication under Article 5(1)(a) which mandates that processing be ""lawful, fair and transparent in relation to the data subject.""

7. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
The DPA carried out an ex officio investigation on how medical tests provider UAB Diagnostikos laboratorija (the controller) handled access requests. The controller processed personal data for about 1 million individuals.,NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 24","1. The case involves a medical tests provider (UAB Diagnostikos laboratorija) processing personal data for approximately 1 million individuals, making it a data controller under Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

   - Not providing copies of personal data as required under Article 15(3)
   - Requiring identity verification when not necessary for the processing purposes, contrary to Article 11(1)
   - Failing to provide information about data sources as mandated by Article 15(1)(g)

3. The controller imposed fees for access requests without demonstrating they were manifestly unfounded or excessive, violating Article 12(5) which requires information to be provided free of charge unless requests are excessive.

4. The controller failed to respond to access requests within the required one-month timeframe specified in Article 12(3), and did not properly inform requesters about extensions as required.

5. The controller's actions regarding access requests violated the fundamental right of access under Article 15 and the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a).

6. The scale of processing (1 million individuals) indicates systematic failures in implementing proper procedures for handling data subject rights requests, contrary to the accountability principle under Article 5(2).

At the time of the investigation, the controller’s privacy policy did not mention the cookies and the pixels. The privacy policy was later amended to list cookies and tracking pixels more completely. However, the new privacy policy still failed to specify the legal basis for processing personal data, and the categories of data processed via the trackers.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 13","1.

2. The controller's initial privacy policy did not mention the use of cookies and tracking pixels, violating Article 13(1) which requires that when personal data is collected from the data subject, the controller must provide information including the purposes of processing and the legal basis for processing at the time of data collection.

3. Even after amendment, the privacy policy failed to specify the legal basis for processing personal data via the trackers, which is required under Article 13(1)(c) (purposes and legal basis for processing).

4. The amended privacy policy also failed to specify the categories of personal data being processed through the trackers, which is required under Article 13(1)(e) (recipients or categories of recipients) and Article 13(2)(a) (storage periods or criteria used), as the nature of tracking pixels typically involves processing categories such as online identifiers, behavior data, and possibly special categories of data if the website deals with sensitive topics like abuse of minors.

5. The use of tracking pixels without a clearly specified legal basis violates Article 6(1), which requires that processing must have a lawful basis such as consent, and the controller must be able to demonstrate this under Article 6 (conditions for consent).

6. Given that the website is a help line for abused minors, any processing of personal data of children requires special protection under Article 8, and the controller must verify that consent is given by the holder of parental responsibility if the child is below 16 years old, which was not addressed in the privacy policy or the case facts.

7. The failure to provide transparent information about the processing activities also violates the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under Article 5(1)(a), as the data subjects were not adequately informed about the processing of their personal data.

8. The use of tracking tools without proper disclosure and legal basis undermines the data subjects' rights under Articles 15-22 (rights of access, rectification, erasure, etc.), as they cannot exercise these rights effectively without knowing the full extent of processing.

9. Therefore, based on multiple violations of Articles 5, 6, 8, and 13 of the GDPR, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Vodafone Romania S.A. (the controller) reported a data breach to the DPA. The data breach involved the personal data of customers, including identification data, client codes, contact details and financial data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 26","1. The case involves Vodafone Romania S.A. as a data controller reporting a personal data breach to the Data Protection Authority (DPA), as required under Article 33(1) of the policy, which mandates notification to the supervisory authority without undue delay and within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach.

2. The breached data included identification data, client codes, contact details, and financial data, which are categories of personal data that could likely result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, particularly given the sensitivity of financial information.

3. Article 34(1) requires that when a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay.

4. The policy provides exceptions to this communication requirement under Article 34(3) only if: (a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures (e.g., encryption) that rendered the data unintelligible; (b) subsequent measures ensure the high risk is no longer likely to materialise; or (c) communication would involve disproportionate effort (in which case a public communication or similar measure is required).

5. The case description does not indicate that Vodafone implemented encryption or other measures that would render the data unintelligible, nor that subsequent measures eliminated the high risk, nor that communication to data subjects was attempted but would involve disproportionate effort.

6. Since the breach involved financial data and other personal information that could lead to identity theft or fraud, it likely presented a high risk to data subjects, triggering the obligation under Article 34(1) to communicate the breach directly to them.

7. The verdict of NONCOMPLIANT suggests that Vodafone failed to meet this obligation to communicate the breach to data subjects, as no evidence is presented that any of the exceptions in Article 34(3) applied.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to the controller's failure to communicate the personal data breach to data subjects when required under Article 34."
The municipality of Palma di Montechiaro (the controller) did not communicate the contact details of its DPO to the DPA. The DPA investigated and found that the controller did not appoint a DPO. The controller eventually appointed a DPO after the DPA notified it of the investigation.,NONCOMPLIANT,Article 37,"1. The case involves the municipality of Palma di Montechiaro as a data controller under the GDPR policy, which establishes obligations for controllers regarding data protection officers (DPOs) as outlined in Article 37.

2. Article 37(1)(a) requires controllers that are public authorities or bodies to designate a data protection officer, with the exception of courts acting in their judicial capacity. As a municipality, the controller falls under this category and is obligated to appoint a DPO.

3. Article 38(7) explicitly states that ""The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority."" This establishes a clear obligation to both appoint a DPO and communicate their contact details to the relevant Data Protection Authority (DPA).

4. The case facts indicate that the controller did not communicate the DPO's contact details to the DPA, and the DPA's investigation further revealed that no DPO had been appointed at all initially.

5. The controller's eventual appointment of a DPO after being notified of the investigation does not remedy the initial period of noncompliance where no DPO was designated as required by Article 37(1)(a), and where contact details were not communicated as required by Article 38(7).

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"In November 2018, the City of Dublin Education and Training Board (CDETB), the state provider of education and training services for the people of Dublin,  notified the Irish DPA (Data Protection Commission-DPC) that its webserver was retaining the personal data of student grant applicants who had uploaded information related to their grant applications through its website, as well as the discovery of malware on the webserver.  The CDETB processed personal data of approximately 13,000 data subjects, identifiable by email address, including special categories of personal data such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin and health data.

In July 2019, the DPA initiated ex officio investigations against the CDETB.

The DPA assessed CDETB’s technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of personal data that it processed on its website in light of the risk of unauthorised access or disclosure of personal data to third parties. It also examined CDETB’s compliance with its obligation to notify data breaches to the DPA promptly, as well as CDETB’s obligation to notify data subjects of the breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34","1. The case involves the City of Dublin Education and Training Board (CDETB) as a data controller processing personal data, including special categories of data (racial/ethnic origin and health data) of approximately 13,000 data subjects, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as per Article 2.

2. CDETB experienced a personal data breach involving unauthorized access through malware on its webserver, where personal data of student grant applicants was retained and potentially exposed. This constitutes a breach of security leading to unauthorized access to personal data, as defined in Article 4(12).

3. CDETB failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). The presence of malware on the webserver and the retention of unnecessary personal data demonstrate insufficient security measures, particularly given the sensitive nature of the processed data (special categories under Article 9) and the number of data subjects affected.

4. CDETB did not notify the supervisory authority (Irish DPA) of the personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, as mandated by Article 33(1). The breach was discovered in November 2018, but the DPA was only notified at that time, and the investigation initiated in July 2019 indicates a lack of prompt notification.

5. CDETB failed to communicate the personal data breach to the data subjects without undue delay when the breach was likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms, as required by Article 34(1). The breach involved special categories of data, which inherently poses a high risk, yet there is no indication that data subjects were informed promptly or at all.

6. The principles of data protection by design and by default under Article 25 were violated, as CDETB did not implement appropriate technical measures (e.g., pseudonymisation or encryption) to protect personal data, and retained data beyond what was necessary, contravening the data minimisation principle under Article 5(1)(c).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR, specifically with Articles 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality), 25 (data protection by design and default), 32 (security of processing), 33 (notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority), and 34 (communication of a personal data breach to the data subject)."
"23andMe is a US based consumer genetics and research company. It offers customers (data subjects) a genetic testing service by analysing a DNA sample provided by them to identify, among others, their ancestry composition, DNA relatives and health predispositions. To view and download the results of their DNA analysis (raw genetic data) customers must create an account.

Between 25 May 2018 and 31 December 2024, a threat actor was able to perpetrate a credential stuffing attack and obtain access to personal data relating to 155,592 UK-based customers of 23andMe.  Some of the data constituted special category personal data relating to health and genetic data, as well as data relating to the racial or ethnic origin.

In August and October 2023, the personal data exfiltrated by the threat actor was offered for sale on a number of online forums.

23andMe became aware of the data breach in October 2023 and notified the DPA (Information Commissioner's Office-ICO).

In June 2024, the DPA informed 23andMe of the launch of investigation into the data breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves 23andMe, a controller processing personal data, including special categories of personal data (genetic data, health data, and data revealing racial or ethnic origin) as defined in Article 4 and subject to the prohibitions and conditions in Article 9.

2. The personal data breach occurred due to a credential stuffing attack, where unauthorized access was obtained to the accounts of 155,592 UK-based customers, resulting in the exfiltration and sale of sensitive personal data on online forums between August and October 2023 (Article 4(12) defines a personal data breach).

3. Under Article 32(1), the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, considering the state of the art, costs, and nature of the processing. Given the sensitivity of genetic and health data (Article 9(1)) and the risks presented by processing such data, stronger safeguards were required.

4. The credential stuffing attack suggests that 23andMe failed to implement adequate technical measures to protect against unauthorized access, such as multi-factor authentication or robust monitoring for suspicious login activity, which would be expected given the high-risk nature of the data processed (Article 32(1)-(a,d) regarding confidentiality and resilience of processing systems).

5. Article 5(1)-(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing. The breach demonstrates a failure to meet this integrity and confidentiality principle.

6. Under Article 24(1), the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the Regulation. The occurrence of the breach indicates insufficient measures were in place to prevent such an incident.

7. Article 33(1) requires notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. While 23andMe notified the DPA (ICO) in October 2023 after becoming aware, the breach had been ongoing since May 2018, suggesting possible deficiencies in breach detection mechanisms.

8. The processing of special category data without sufficient safeguards violates Article 9(1), which prohibits such processing unless specific conditions apply (e.g., explicit consent under Article 9(2)-(a)). Even if a condition applied, the security failures undermine the lawful basis for processing.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to failures in security measures under Articles 5(1)-(f), 24(1), and 32(1), inadequate protection of special category data under Article 9, and potential delays in breach notification under Article 33(1)."
"The Department of Social Protection (DSP) processes biometric facial templates and uses facial matching technologies, as part of the registration process for the Public Services Card. This process is known as “SAFE 2 registration” and is mandatory for anyone who wishes to apply for a Public Services Card. Persons who do not submit to such processing cannot access DSP services, including welfare payments. The rollout of Safe 2 registration has resulted in the ongoing collection, storage and processing of highly sensitive personal data, including biometric data consisting of facial templates, on a large scale by the DSP.

In July 2021, the DPA (Data Protection Commission-DPC) initiated investigations ex officio to examine whether the DSP:

a.	had a lawful basis for collecting biometric data for the purposes of conducting facial matching as part of SAFE 2 registration,

b.	had a lawful basis for retaining biometric data for the purposes of conducting facial matching as part of SAFE 2 registration,

c.	complied with its transparency obligations, and

d.	had carried out an adequate Data Protection Impact Assessment",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 35","1. The case involves the Department of Social Protection (DSP) processing biometric facial templates, which constitutes special category personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, as biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person is explicitly classified as special category data.

2. For processing special category data to be lawful, it must meet one of the conditions in Article 9(2). The DSP claimed processing was necessary for reasons of substantial public interest under Article 9(2)(g), but failed to identify a specific EU or Member State law that authorized this processing and provided appropriate safeguards, as required by Article 9(2)(g) which states processing must be ""on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.""

3. The DSP made SAFE 2 registration mandatory for accessing essential services, effectively coercing individuals into providing biometric data. This violates the requirement for consent to be freely given under Article 7(4), which states that ""when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether... the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.""

4. The DSP failed to meet its transparency obligations under Articles 12, 13, and 14. Specifically, it did not provide adequate information to data subjects about the processing of their biometric data, including the purposes, legal basis, and retention periods, as required by Article 13(1)(c) and (2)(a).

5. The processing operation required a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(1) and (3)(b) due to the large-scale processing of special category data. The DSP failed to carry out an adequate DPIA that properly assessed the risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms and identified appropriate mitigation measures.

6. The processing violated the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c), as the retention of biometric data for facial matching purposes was not limited to what was necessary for the specified purposes.

7. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The DPA carried out an ex officio investigation of the Consulate General of Sweden in Istanbul (the controller) in order to assess its compliance with the GDPR and other Regulations (the VIS Regulation and the Borders Regulation).

During the investigation, the DPA carried out an on-site inspection of the Consulate. The DPA also assessed the operations of VSF Global (the processor), an external provider responsible for transmitting most of the VISA applications received by the Consulate. Applications were collected on the processor’s premises, which included an area reserved for the personnel of the Swedish mission. This area was secured via a biometric locking system that recognized the fingerprints of authorized personnel.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 32","1. The case involves the Consulate General of Sweden in Istanbul as the controller and VSF Global as the processor, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 4 (definitions of 'controller' and 'processor').

2. The controller (Consulate) engaged a processor (VSF Global) for processing VISA applications, which involves personal data. According to Article 28(3), processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or other legal act that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller, setting out specific requirements including subject-matter, duration, nature, purpose, type of personal data, categories of data subjects, and obligations/rights of the controller.

3. The case does not mention the existence of such a contract between the controller and processor, which violates Article 28(3) requiring that processing by a processor be governed by a binding contract with specific content.

4. The processor used a biometric locking system (fingerprint recognition) for access control to secured areas. Biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitutes special category data under Article 9(1), which is prohibited unless one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) applies.

5. The processing of biometric data (fingerprints) for access control does not appear to meet any of the exceptions under Article 9(2), particularly since there is no indication that explicit consent was obtained (Article 9(2)(a)) or that it was necessary for reasons of substantial public interest (Article 9(2)(g)), making this processing unlawful under Article 9.

6. The controller failed to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as required by Article 35(1) for processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons, particularly when processing special categories of data on a large scale (Article 35(3)(b)), which includes biometric data.

7. The arrangement where the processor had an area reserved for personnel of the Swedish mission suggests potential joint controllership, but there is no evidence of a transparent arrangement determining respective responsibilities as required by Article 26(1) for joint controllers.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of Article 28(3) (lack of proper processor contract), Article 9 (unlawful processing of special category biometric data), Article 35(1) (failure to conduct DPIA), and potentially Article 26(1) (lack of arrangement for joint controllership)."
"Alianța pentru Unirea Românilor (AUR, the controller) is a Romanian political party. The data subjects were natural persons who either registered on the controller’s campaign websites or used its mobile application.

In early 2025, the controller submitted two personal data breach notifications under Article 33 GDPR to the Romanian National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing (ANSPDCP). The DPA also received additional complaints from individuals regarding the controller’s data processing practices.

The first incident concerned the controller’s mobile application, aur.mobi. A misconfiguration allowed unauthorised third-party access to the app’s source code. As a result, personal data of users (including name, phone number, email address, home address, national ID number, date of birth, nationality, citizenship, sex, religion, profession, education history, political experience, and spoken languages) were accessible without authentication.

In parallel, the DPA investigated the controller’s operation of two campaign websites, semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org, used to collect personal data for political outreach and statistical analysis. The controller collected data such as name, national ID card number, address, date of birth, email, phone number, and handwritten signature from a large number of individuals. The controller did not provide a valid legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR, nor were the data minimised in accordance with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

During the investigation, the controller took both websites offline.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 25, Article 32","1. The case involves Alianța pentru Unirea Românilor (AUR) as a data controller processing personal data of individuals through its mobile application and campaign websites, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1).

2. The controller's mobile application, aur.mobi, had a misconfiguration that allowed unauthorized third-party access to personal data including sensitive categories such as national ID number, religion, and political experience. This constitutes a personal data breach under Article 4(12) and violates the security requirements under Article 32(1) which mandates appropriate technical measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

3. The processing of special categories of personal data (including religion and political opinions) through the mobile application occurred without meeting any of the conditions under Article 9(2), making this processing unlawful under Article 9(1).

4. For both the mobile application and campaign websites (semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org), the controller failed to establish a valid legal basis for processing under Article 6(1), as acknowledged in the case facts, thereby violating the lawfulness principle under Article 5(1)(a).

5. The controller collected excessive personal data (including national ID card number, handwritten signature, and extensive personal details) for political outreach purposes, violating the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) which requires data to be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary.

6. The combination of these violations (lack of security measures, unlawful processing of special categories, absence of legal basis, and excessive data collection) demonstrates systemic non-compliance with multiple fundamental principles of the GDPR under Article 5(1).

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"In 2022 Denmark replaced it digital post system with a new system, the Next Generation Digital Post (Næste generations Digital Post). The system was operated by the Danish Agency for Digitalization (Digitaliseringsstyrelsen- the controller).

The controller notified four data breaches to the DPA between 2022 and 2023. Additionally, the controller admitted a fifth breach in a statement explaining a system update.

In 2023 the DPA started an ex officio investigation. It found that all the breaches were caused by technical errors in the system’s implementation:

* In March 2022 about 15,000 users were accidentally granted reading right to other people’s mailboxes. The breach was due to a misunderstanding between the providers of the new and old systems during the migration of the database.
* In February 2023 a coding error caused the incorrect revocation of reading rights for a small number of users;
* Another migration error caused users to lose reading rights. The error affected about 7,000 users with reading rights for a large number of mailboxes;
* In November 2022 yet another migration error caused 42,000 citizens to be enrolled by mistakes. This sometimes prevented them from responding to official communication carried out via the digital post system.
* Finally, a bug in a 2023 system update resulted in the removal of more than 116,000 natural persons and 1,700 companies from the system and in the accidental enrolment of about 30,000 Greenland residents.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the Danish Agency for Digitalization as the data controller processing personal data through its Next Generation Digital Post system, which falls under the material scope of the GDPR as defined in Article 2(1), as it involves automated processing of personal data forming part of a filing system.

2. The controller experienced multiple data breaches between 2022-2023 due to technical errors in system implementation, including unauthorized access to mailboxes, incorrect revocation of reading rights, mistaken enrollments, and accidental removals from the system, affecting thousands of data subjects.

3. Under Article 5(1)(f), personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The repeated technical errors demonstrate a failure to implement adequate security measures to prevent such breaches.

4. Article 32 requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems. The migration errors, coding errors, and system bugs show insufficient technical safeguards.

5. Article 33 mandates that controllers notify personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of them. While the controller notified four breaches and admitted a fifth, the recurring nature of these incidents indicates systemic security deficiencies rather than isolated incidents.

6. The principle of accountability under Article 5(2) requires the controller to be responsible for, and able to demonstrate compliance with, the data protection principles. The repeated breaches across multiple years demonstrate an inability to maintain compliance with security obligations.

7. The breaches resulted in unauthorized access to personal data (violating confidentiality), incorrect processing of data (violating accuracy under Article 5(1)(d)), and prevented data subjects from accessing official communications (violating the integrity and availability principles under Article 5(1)(f)).

8. The cumulative effect of multiple serious breaches caused by technical implementation errors shows a pattern of non-compliance with the fundamental security obligations required by the GDPR, particularly Articles 5(1)(f), 32, and 33.

9. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy."
"A sports betting agency (the controller) verified users by requesting them to send a copy of their ID by e-mail. The DPA began an ex officio investigation after receiving a report on this, as it posed a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

The DPA found that the controller processed a wide range of personal data from the identity cards, including name, date of birth, address of residence and ID numbers. This was processed without sufficient technical and organizational measures in relation to the risk; for example, some employees used weak passwords that were three characters long. The program was also merged with an unsafe HTTP connection, which does not encrypt the data. Finally, the controller did not ensure the data was erased once the storage limit had passed.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5,"1. The controller (sports betting agency) processed personal data from identity cards, including name, date of birth, address, and ID numbers. According to Article 9(1), processing of such data is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The case does not indicate that explicit consent was obtained or that any other lawful basis under Article 9(2) was met for processing this special category data, constituting a violation.

2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, employees used weak passwords (three characters long) and data was transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection, failing to meet the security requirements including ""the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems"" and ""pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data.""

3. The controller did not erase personal data once the storage limit had passed, violating the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.

4. The processing of ID document data via unsecure email and HTTP transmission without encryption violates the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f), which requires processing in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized access.

5. The controller's failure to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25, particularly given the high-risk nature of processing identity document data, further demonstrates noncompliance with the Regulation's requirements to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures both at the time of determining the means for processing and at the time of processing itself.

6. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"The DPA received an anonymous report regarding a data breach regarding over one million vehicle owners from the Croatian vehicle register. The DPA investigated several organisations associated with the incident, such as the Croatian Insurance Bureau (HUO), Vehicle Centre and the Ministry of the Interior.

During its investigations, the DPA found that the data submitted through the anonymous report coincided with that of the HUO database. This allowed the DPA to establish HUO as the controller. The data included personal information of the owner of the vehicle (e.g. name and address), data on the vehicle (e.g. registration number), and insurance data (e.g. policy number, date of validity).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32","1. The case involves a data breach affecting over one million vehicle owners, with personal data including names, addresses, vehicle registration numbers, and insurance information being compromised, which qualifies as personal data under Article 4(1) of the policy.

2. The Croatian Insurance Bureau (HUO) was identified as the controller of the breached database, making it responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection principles under Article 5, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and integrity/confidentiality of processing.

3. The breach was reported anonymously to the DPA rather than by HUO itself, indicating a failure by the controller to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay and within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, as required under Article 33(1).

4. The nature of the breached data (including vehicle and insurance information) suggests processing activities that likely require appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 32(1) to ensure security, including protection against unauthorized access, which appear to have been inadequate given the scale of the breach.

5. The processing of vehicle registration and insurance data may involve special categories of data or large-scale processing, potentially triggering the requirement for a Data Protection Impact Assessment under Article 35(3), which the controller may have failed to conduct properly.

6. As the controller, HUO violated the accountability principle under Article 5(2) by failing to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, particularly regarding security measures and breach notification obligations.

7. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy due to violations of multiple provisions including Articles 5, 32, 33, and 35."
"The DPA received many complaints about aggressive marketing on behalf of energy provider Energia Verde S.p.a. (the controller).

Data subjects repeatedly reported similar issues:

* They received unwanted calls with no legal basis;
* They received calls despite having signed up for the Do Not Call registry;
* The controller did not honor their request. In its responses, the controller claimed that it was unable to grant requests because it relied on third party providers for marketing and could only forward the requests to those providers.

The DPA opened a broad investigation against the controller. The investigation also covered the collection of consent to direct marketing via a consent form on the controller’s website, as well as the marketing activities carried out via several processors and sub-processors.

During the investigation, the DPA required detaiedl information about all telemarketing contracts concluded during one specific week (“sample week”), including proof of consent to the initial marketing communication. The DPA found that about 6% of the contracts concluded during the sample week, related to numbers that were unlawfully called despite their inclusion in the Do Not Call registry.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 31","1. The case involves a controller (Energia Verde S.p.a.) processing personal data for direct marketing purposes, which falls under the scope of the GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and Article 4 definitions of 'processing' and 'controller'.

2. The controller made marketing calls to data subjects registered on the Do Not Call registry, which constitutes processing for direct marketing purposes where the data subject has objected to such processing, violating Article 21(2) and (3) which state that where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time, and where the data subject objects, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.

3. The controller failed to honor data subjects' requests to stop processing their data for marketing purposes, violating Article 12(3) which requires the controller to provide information on action taken on a request without undue delay and within one month of receipt, and Article 21(3) which specifically requires that when personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the right to object shall be explicitly brought to the data subject's attention and presented clearly.

4. The controller attempted to evade responsibility by claiming it relied on third-party providers for marketing activities, violating Article 28(1) which requires that controllers use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate measures, and Article 28(3) which mandates that processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract that requires the processor to process data only on documented instructions from the controller.

5. The controller's failure to properly manage its processors violates Article 24(1) which requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the Regulation.

6. The investigation revealed that approximately 6% of contracts during the sample week involved processing of personal data (calling numbers) that were registered on the Do Not Call registry, indicating a systematic failure to comply with data subjects' objections to processing, violating the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and the specific provisions regarding processing for direct marketing in Article 21.

7. The collection of consent via the website form may not have met the requirements for valid consent under Article 4(11) and Article 7, particularly given the aggressive marketing practices reported, but the specific details of the consent form are not provided in the case description.

8. The controller's overall approach demonstrates a failure to comply with the accountability principle under Article 5(2) and to implement appropriate measures to ensure compliance with data subject rights under Chapter III of the GDPR.

9. Therefore, based on multiple violations of the GDPR including Articles 5, 12, 21, 24, and 28, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Data Diggers Market Research SRL (the controller) processed personal data of natural persons (the data subjects) across EU borders. On 21 May 2025, the Romanian National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing (ANSPDCP) published its decision after concluding an investigation initiated in April 2025.

The investigation arose from complaints referred by two other EU DPAs, each lodged by an individual against the controller. Because the controller has its main establishment in Romania, ANSPDCP acted as the lead supervisory authority under [[Article 56 GDPR]] and [[Article 61 GDPR]].

ANSPDCP found that, upon receiving access requests, the controller did not provide complete information as required by [[Article 15 GDPR]] read together with [[Article 12 GDPR#1]]. It also failed, at first communication, to supply the information prescribed by [[Article 14 GDPR]] read together with [[Article 12 GDPR#1]], despite processing data obtained indirectly from sources other than the data subjects. Finally, ANSPDCP determined that the controller did not demonstrate any valid legal basis for its processing activities, in breach of [[Article 6 GDPR#1]].",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 14, Article 15","1. The case involves Data Diggers Market Research SRL as a controller processing personal data of natural persons across EU borders, which falls under the territorial scope of the GDPR as per Article 3, given the cross-border nature and the controller's establishment in Romania.

2. The Romanian National Supervisory Authority (ANSPDCP) acted as the lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1) because the controller has its main establishment in Romania, and the processing concerned cross-border data subjects, necessitating cooperation with other concerned supervisory authorities under Article 61.

3. ANSPDCP found that the controller did not provide complete information in response to access requests, violating Article 15(1), which grants data subjects the right to obtain confirmation of processing, access to personal data, and specific information including purposes, categories of data, recipients, storage periods, and other rights. This failure also breaches Article 12(1), which requires controllers to provide any communication relating to processing in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form.

4. The controller failed to supply the information prescribed by Article 14(1)-(3) at the time of first communication, despite processing data obtained indirectly from sources other than the data subjects. Article 14 mandates that controllers provide specific information to data subjects when personal data have not been obtained from them, including the identity of the controller, purposes of processing, categories of data, recipients, and other necessary details to ensure fair and transparent processing. This omission violates Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 12(1), which emphasizes the need for transparent communication.

5. ANSPDCP determined that the controller did not demonstrate any valid legal basis for its processing activities, contravening Article 6(1), which requires that processing be lawful only if it satisfies at least one of the conditions listed, such as consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or legitimate interests. The absence of a lawful basis undermines the fundamental principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a).

6. The failures to comply with Articles 12, 14, and 15 constitute infringements of the GDPR, as these provisions are essential for ensuring transparency, fairness, and the exercise of data subject rights, which are core objectives of the Regulation as stated in Article 1.

7. Given the violations of multiple articles, the controller's processing operations are not in accordance with the GDPR, and the case is therefore NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"Menarini Silicon Biosystem S.p.a. (the controller) is a life science research company and part of the Menarini pharmaceutical group. The DPA carried out an ex officio inspection of the company in order to assess the GDPR compliance of its research activity. In particular, the DPA focused on the development of CellFind, a software tool for screening cancer by analyzing blood samples.

At the time of the investigation and the following decision, CellFind was still undergoing research and development. The controller was considering making the tool available on the market, depending on the results of the experimental phase.

CellFind was based on image recognition algorithms that distinguished cancer cells from healthy cells. The controller developed these algorithms by training an AI image recognition system on data sets consisting of images of blood cells. The algorithm of CellFind was “locked”, in that deployers of the tool were not able to develop it further or change it in any way.

The controller was training CellFind on several data sets relating to different types of cancer. Each data sets consisted of images from both cancer patients and healthy individuals (serving as the control group). The data sets were provided by a number of processors and sub-processors, including a US branch of the Menarini corporate group.

All data subjects were provided with a privacy notice and consented to the processing of their data for developing the tool. Specifically, they were provided with one of two privacy notices, depending on whether they were cancer patients or healthy donors from the control group.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13","1. The case involves Menarini Silicon Biosystem S.p.a. as a controller processing special categories of health data (images of blood cells from cancer patients and healthy donors) for research and development purposes, which falls under the scope of GDPR as per Article 2 (material scope) and involves processing activities covered by the regulation.

2. The controller transferred personal data to a US-based branch (a sub-processor) without demonstrating appropriate safeguards for international data transfers as required by Article 44 (general principle for transfers) and Article 46 (transfers subject to appropriate safeguards). The case does not indicate the presence of an adequacy decision under Article 45, binding corporate rules under Article 47, or other valid transfer mechanisms, making the transfer noncompliant.

3. The processing involved special category data (health data) under Article 9(1), which requires explicit consent under Article 9(2)(a) or other specific conditions. While consent was obtained, the case does not demonstrate that it met the strict requirements for explicit consent or that alternative conditions for processing health data (such as public interest research under Article 9(2)(j)) were properly applied with appropriate safeguards.

4. The privacy notices provided to data subjects (both cancer patients and healthy donors) likely failed to include all required information under Articles 13 and 14, particularly concerning international transfers to the US branch (as required by Articles 13(1)(f) and 14(1)(f)) and the rights of data subjects in relation to such transfers.

5. The use of ""locked"" algorithms involving automated processing of health data for cancer screening may constitute automated decision-making under Article 22, requiring suitable safeguards including human intervention (Article 22(3)), which were not demonstrated in the case description.

6. The controller's reliance on consent for processing health data in a research context where participation might be perceived as conditional (especially for patients) raises issues under Article 7(4) regarding freely given consent, particularly as the processing involved international transfers to third countries without adequate protection.

7. The case does not demonstrate compliance with the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25, particularly regarding the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only necessary personal data are processed.

8. Therefore, considering the multiple violations including inadequate safeguards for international data transfers, insufficient basis for processing special category data, potential issues with consent validity, and lack of demonstrated compliance with data protection principles, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the GDPR policy."
"In 2023 the DPA started a number of ex officio investigations on the use of cookies and other trackers on the websites of a number of businesses. One of these businesses was car retailer Confalonieri S.r.l. (the data controller).

The DPA found that the controller’s website displayed a cookie banner with three buttons: “Accept all”, “Learn more”, and an “X” button that would close the banner. The website included links to a cookie policy, a privacy notice, and a page with cookie settings.

The investigation highlighted the following issues:

* If visitors clicked the “X” button, the banner was displayed again upon subsequent visits to the website;
* The website did not store unnecessary cookies when visitors clicked the “X” button. However, the cookie banner did not inform users that they could refuse cookies this way;
* The cookie policy did not list the recipients of personal data;
* The cookie policy and the privacy notice both contained outdated legal references.

The controller changed its website during the investigation. After the update, the website displayed a small footer that succinctly informed visitors that they “declared that they read the privacy policy (…) and consent to the processing of their personal data for the required service”. The only available buttons were “Accept” and “Privacy notice”. The cookie policy was no longer available on the website and the privacy notice contained no mention of cookies and other trackers.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13","1. The case involves a car retailer (Confalonieri S.r.l.) acting as a data controller processing personal data through cookies and trackers on its website, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as processing by automated means (Article 2).

2. The initial cookie banner with an ""X"" button that closed the banner but caused it to reappear on subsequent visits, without informing users that this action could refuse cookies, violates the principle of transparency (Article 5(1)(a)) and the requirement to provide clear information about the right to object (Article 21(4)), as users were not properly informed about how to exercise their rights.

3. The cookie policy's failure to list recipients of personal data violates Article 13(1)(e), which requires controllers to provide information about ""the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any"" when data is collected from the data subject.

4. The outdated legal references in both the cookie policy and privacy notice violate Article 12(1), which requires information to be provided in ""a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language,"" as outdated information undermines intelligibility and accuracy.

5. The controller's changes during the investigation introduced further violations: the footer's statement that users ""consent to the processing"" by implication, without an explicit action, violates Article 4(11) and Article 7, which define consent as requiring ""a clear affirmative action"" and being ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.""

6. The removal of the cookie policy and the privacy notice's lack of information about cookies and trackers violate Article 13, which mandates that controllers provide comprehensive information about processing purposes, legal basis, data categories, recipients, and other elements at the time of data collection.

7. The absence of a mechanism to refuse cookies easily (e.g., a ""Reject"" button) and the lack of a cookie settings page violate Article 21(2) and (5), which require that the right to object be ""explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject"" and presented ""clearly and separately from any other information.""

8. The cumulative failures to provide transparent information, obtain valid consent, and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights (e.g., right to object, right to information) result in non-compliance with multiple principles under Article 5, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and accountability.

9. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"An information and communication company (the controller) reported a data breach to the DPA, who began an investigation.  The data breach resulted from a hacking attack, in which a third party was able to access and move the entire information system. This gave them access to personal data of data subjects in the controller’s servers.

The controller took measures immediately after learning of the data breach, including initiating steps to recover the IT system.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a data breach where a third party accessed and moved the entire information system of an information and communication company (the controller), compromising personal data on its servers (Article 4, defining ""personal data"" and ""processing"").

2. The controller is subject to the obligation under Article 32 to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to protect against unauthorised access to personal data.

3. The fact that a hacking attack resulted in access to and movement of the entire information system indicates a failure to implement adequate security measures, as required by Article 32(1), which specifies measures such as encryption, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems.

4. Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The breach demonstrates a violation of this principle.

5. While the controller took measures after learning of the breach, including steps to recover the IT system, Article 32 requires proactive implementation of security measures to prevent such breaches, not just reactive measures after a breach has occurred.

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to the controller's failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of personal data as required by Article 32 and Article 5(1)(f)."
"The Hospital Board of the Region of Uppsala (the controller) is responsible for providing health care at the Uppsala University Hospital and the Enköping Hospital.

On 29 November 2022 the DPA received a report about a data breach regarding the controller’s processing of patients’ data. According to the report, personal data of patients (including their personal identity numbers and health data) were processed via insecure emails. The DPA started an ex officio investigation.

The investigation found that the controller implemented an email encryption tool (on top of standard, in-transit encryption) in order to secure internal emails. The controller required all its staff to use the tool to encrypt any sensitive data sent via internal emails. However, the staff did not always follow this policy: at least 15 emails were sent unencrypted between 2010 and 2022. The DPA noted that this practice potentially exposed personal data in certain situations: for instance, if a staff member accidentally forwarded an email to an unintended recipient, the recipients would be able to read it. The risk of unintended disclosure was especially high because the controller did not monitor traffic to and from the email accounts of its staff.

Additionally, DPA found that the controller used automated messaging system relating to identify number merging. These messages were unencrypted and contained personal data of patients.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves the Hospital Board of the Region of Uppsala as the controller processing patients' personal data, including special categories of health data and personal identity numbers, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation (Article 2).

2. The processing of health data and personal identity numbers constitutes processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1), which is generally prohibited unless specific conditions are met under Article 9(2).

3. The controller implemented an email encryption tool but failed to ensure its consistent use by staff, resulting in at least 15 unencrypted emails containing sensitive personal data being sent between 2010-2022 (violating Article 32(1) which requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk).

4. The controller failed to monitor email traffic to and from staff accounts (violating Article 32(1)'s requirement to implement appropriate measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems).

5. The automated messaging system for identity number merging processed personal data without encryption (violating Article 5(1)(f) requiring processing in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorised disclosure).

6. The controller's failures created risks of unauthorized access and disclosure of sensitive health data (violating Article 32(2) which requires taking into account the risks of accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data).

7. The processing of special categories of data without adequate safeguards violates the general principles of data protection under Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality) and the specific provisions for processing special categories of data under Article 9.

8. The controller did not demonstrate compliance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2), as it failed to implement and enforce adequate security measures despite having awareness of the encryption requirement.

Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy."
"Agricola International SA (the controller) is company that sells poultry and other foods. The controller reported a data breach to the DPA, who carried out an investigation. A cyberattack affected a significant number of employees, as well as their family members and customers. This included access to identity documents of employees and their spouses, information on the employee’s position (e.g. their department or employee status), as well as the employees' parents’ date of birth.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32,"1. The case involves a controller (Agricola International SA) processing personal data of employees, their family members, and customers, which falls under the material scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2(1).

2. The breached data included identity documents of employees and their spouses, information on employee positions, and employees' parents' dates of birth. Identity documents may contain special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs), and dates of birth constitute personal data under Article 4(1).

3. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1), given that a cyberattack resulted in unauthorized access to personal data.

4. The processing of special categories of personal data (potentially contained in identity documents) without a lawful basis under Article 9(2) constitutes a violation, as the case does not indicate any applicable exception such as explicit consent or necessity for employment purposes.

5. The breach affected data subjects beyond employees (including family members and customers), indicating potential violations of the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c), as the controller may have processed more personal data than necessary for its purposes.

6. The controller's failure to prevent unauthorized access through adequate security measures violates the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f).

7. While the controller reported the breach to the DPA (consistent with Article 33(1)), the occurrence of the breach itself demonstrates noncompliance with the security obligations under Articles 5(1)(f), 24(1), and 32.

8. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT with the policy."
"In April 2021, Birthlink, a Scottish charity that maintains Adoption Contact Register for Scotland, destroyed manual adoption records containing sensitive personal data of about 4,800 individuals without authorisation, breaching Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 5(2) UK GDPR.

The organisation also lacked required data protection policies and staff training, contravening Article 32(1) UK GDPR, Article 32(2) UK GDPR. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) was only notified in September 2023, two years late, in violation of Article 33 UK GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33","1. The case involves Birthlink, a Scottish charity acting as a data controller, processing sensitive personal data (adoption records) which falls under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) and special categories of data in Article 9(1).

2. The unauthorized destruction of manual adoption records containing sensitive personal data of approximately 4,800 individuals violates Article 5(1)(f), which requires that personal data be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.""

3. The organization's failure to demonstrate compliance with data protection principles violates Article 5(2) (the accountability principle), which states that ""The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, the principles of 'lawfulness, fairness and transparency', 'purpose limitation', 'data minimisation', 'accuracy', 'storage limitation', 'integrity and confidentiality'.""

4. The lack of required data protection policies and staff training contravenes Article 32(1), which mandates that ""the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,"" and Article 32(2), which requires that ""the controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller.""

5. The two-year delay in notifying the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) about the personal data breach violates Article 33(1), which requires that ""the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55.""

6. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy due to multiple violations of GDPR provisions including Article 5(1)(f), Article 5(2), Article 32(1), Article 32(2), and Article 33(1)."
