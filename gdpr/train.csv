The complainant has requested the disclosure of information about complaints in respect of a specified property over a defined period of time. Canterbury City Council (“the Council”) withheld the information because it considered that the information within scope was the personal data of third parties and that disclosure would breach the GDPR principles. The complainant challenged the decision before the ICO.,"The Commissioner’s decision is that, as the complainant and his family have either owned or occupied the land in question during the time period specified, all the information falling within the scope of the request is in fact the complainant’s own personal data. The ICO has therefore applied Regulation 5(3) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) which prevents disclosure to the world at large of information including personal data. Also, the ICO considered that the personal data at issue were criminal offence data about the complainant, as described by Article 10 GDPR, and not special category of personal data, as described by Article 9 GDPR.

The complainant requested information about members’ registers of declaration of interest. Snowdonia National Park Authority (‘the Authority’) withheld the information requested under section 40(2) of the FOIA. This provision applies as an exemption to the principle of disclosure, if there is third party personal data concerned. The Commissioner found that the Authority had incorrectly applied section 40(2) to the request. The Commissioner required the public authority to disclose the information requested by the complainant, namely, the previous copies of the members’ registered of declaration of interest. The Commission found that the information comprised declaration of personal interest forms completed by members of the Authority with the name of the members. However, the members named in these declarations of interest, are deceased. Thus, the information at issue cannot constitute personal data relating to a living identifiable individual as defined by the adaption law of the GDPR.

The complainant has requested a copy of an inspection report named kennels to the Pendle Borough Council (the Council). The Council refused as it considered it to be third party personal data under 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The complainant challenged the decision before the ICO.,"The ICO confirmed that the requested information was considered to be personal data pursuant to Section 3(2) of the Data Protection Act (DPA) and Article 4(1) GDPR. Pursuant to the FOIA and the GDPR, the ICO balanced the right to information and the protection of the personal data at issue in order to assess if the disclosure would contravene Article (1)(a) GDPR principle. It found that the access to information request did not override the third party right to privacy. The ICO found that the refusal of disclosure was justified and it was legitimate to withhold the information under section 40(2) of the FOIA by virtue of section 40(3A)(a) for transparency purposes.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6"
"The complainant submitted a request to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) under the UK Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeking access to a fax cover sheet sent to the Veterans Welfare Service regarding a claim for payment following the death in service of the complainant’s son.

The MOD provided the complainant with a redacted version of the document in question, but sought to withhold the redacted information on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA, which

The complainant challenged the decision before the ICO, in the ICO's capacity under the Freedom of Information Act.","The ICO first held, that ""the two main elements of personal data are that the information must relate to a living person and that the person must be identifiable.""

On the ""legitimate interest"" the ICO applied a three-part test:

* Legitimate interest test: Whether a legitimate interest is being pursued in the request for information;
* Necessity test: Whether disclosure of the information is necessary to meet the legitimate interest in question;
* Balancing test: Whether the above interests override the legitimate interest(s) or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.

While balancing legitimate interest in disclosure against data subject’s interest and fundamental rights and freedoms, the Commissioner considered that the public authority would have infringed Articles 5(1)(a) and 6(1)(f) of the GDPR in disclosing this information. It found that the disclosure was not necessary to pursue a legitimate interest and it would have caused unjustified harm to the data subjects. Overall, the interests and rights of the data subjects were likely to override legitimate interest in disclosure. Therefore, the ICO decided that the redacted information is exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6"
"The complainant has requested information from University of Leicester about external examiners for the department of engineering between the years 2010 to 2018. The University withheld the information, citing section 40(2) (personal information) of the FOIA.

The complainant challenged the decision before the ICO.","As per the applicability of Article Articles 40(2) FOIA, it must be determined whether the withheld information constitutes personal data and, in the affirmative, whether disclosure of that data would breach any of the data protection principles under the Data Protection Act.

According to the ICO the information at stake is personal data. The fact that information constitutes the personal data of identifiable living individuals does not automatically exclude it from disclosure under the FOIA.

The second element of the test is to determine whether disclosure would contravene any of the data protection principles. In the present case, the most relevant principle is the one protected under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR: ""Personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject"".

The Commissioner considers that the most likely applicable lawful bases is the legitimate interest of the controller under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. In considering the application of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR in the context of a request for information under FOIA it is necessary to consider the three-part test: (i) legitimate interest, (ii) necessity and (iii) balancing of conflicting interests.

The Commissioner accepts that the complainant has (i) a legitimate interest in seeing the requested information and that the disclosure is (ii) necessary for meeting a legitimate public interest. Such interest is to be (iii) balanced against the data subjects’ interests.

In carrying out the assessment under (iii) it is necessary to consider the impact of disclosure in terms of harm or distress, the reasonable expectations of the individual as well as whether the information is already in the public domain.

Within the University’s response to the Commissioner’s enquiries, it outlined that at the time of the request, the external examiners for that academic year had also been the external examiners for the previous two academic years. Therefore, the University argued, any student who had concerns about any conflicts of interest an external examiner might have had,would already have had two years in which to complain.

Based on the above factors, the Commissioner has determined that there is insufficient legitimate interest to outweigh the data subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms. The Commissioner therefore considers that there is no Article 6 basis for processing and so the disclosure of the information would not be lawful.

In conclusion, the ICO decided that the University was entitled to rely on the exemption at section 40(2) FOIA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6"
"The Department of Education (the DfE) was requested to provide the entire audio recording of a Professional Conduct Panel hearing into a case against five teachers - so called Trojan Horse affair. (This involved investigations into the alleged infiltration of Islamist extremists into the education sector in Birmingham. These hearings investigate whether there has been unacceptable professional misconduct by these five teachers) The hearing took place in public and was recorded by the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL).  The panel’s decision was announced on the government’s website.

The complainant argued with the DfE that the audio files contain important information not found elsewhere such as how statements were spoken including intonation and emotion. He further argues that this is essential for public scrutiny and transparency in this case.

The request was refused by the DfE under section 40(2) (personal information), 31(2) (law enforcement) and 14 (vexatious request) of the FOIA.

- Section 40 of the FOIA provides exemptions from the right to information if it is personal data as defined in the DPA.

-Section 14 states that the public authorities do not have to comply with vexatious requests.

The complainant filed a complaint against the DfE with the ICO about the way his request for information had been handled by the DfE.","The ICO  starts its ruling by stating that complying with the present request would not be a burden for the DfE, and moved on to consider if the requested information constituted personal data as defined  by the Data Protection Act 2018 (‘DPA’).

By referring to section 3(2) of the DPA, the ICO stated that the withheld information in the audio record falls within the definition of ‘personal data’, it relates to and identifies the data subjects concerned.  Audio recording would reveal the identities of individuals involved and would capture information related to religious views due to the hearing relating to alleged extremism.  Moreover, the requested data does include special category data. Here, the commissioner refers to article 9 of the GDPR.  ‘There will be clear references to the religious beliefs of some of the individuals’ and it would be difficult to separate out the special category data without rendering some of the remaining information meaningless, particularly as the request concerns audio recordings. As none of the conditions required by article 9 of GDPR for processing special category data are satisfied there is no legal basis for its disclosure.  Processing any special category data in the recordings would therefore breach principle of DP and so this information is exempt under section 40(2) of the FOIA.

The ICO has gone on to consider if there are conditions defined by an article 6 of GDPR (in this case art.6 (1)(f)) to allow for the lawful processing of the remaining personal data in the audio recordings that is not special category data. The ICO considered three-part test: Legitimate interest Necessity and Balancing tests. While the ICO acknowledges that the disclosure of the requested information is necessary to meet the legitimate interests identified by the complainant, it determined that that legitimate interest is insufficient to outweigh the data subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9"
"ICO examined a complaint submitted against the Northamptonshire Police regarding the way in which it handled a request for information. Namely, the complainant requested information from the Northamptonshire Police on whether it forcibly entered a property that he owns, but leases to a tenant, on suspicion that the property contained drugs. The complainant stated in the request that he could not obtain the information from the tenant itself. The Northamptonshire Police responded that it will neither confirm nor deny whether the entry took place, as sharing any information without the tenant’s consent would be contrary to the Data Protection Act 2018.","Regarding the first criteria, ICO concluded that confirming or denying whether Northamptonshire Police forced entry at a specific property would involve the disclosure of a third party’s personal data (i.e. the tenant’s). Although the request for information relates to the residential address and no individual is explicitly named, it is possible to identify the tenant as the occupant of the property. ICO therefore concluded that the information on whether Northamptonshire Police forced entry at the property is in fact information which relates to the tenant, withing the meaning of the GDPR.

As for the second criteria, ICO concluded that confirming or denying whether forced entry took place (i.e. disclosing data) constitutes data processing. Therefore, such disclosure must be done in a lawful, fair and transparent manner in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Specifically, ICO found that the processing in this case constitutes processing of ""criminal offence data"" within the meaning of Article 10 of the GDPR. This is because confirming or denying would disclose that that the tenant’s house either had, or had not, been raided by Northampton Police in connection with the presence of drugs in the property. Since such ""criminal offence data"" are sensitive data, they can only be processed (i) if there is a consent of the data subject, or (ii) if the data were made manifestly public by the data subject. None of these conditions were satisfied in the case in question (on the contrary, the tenant refused to provide the complainant with any information), which is why ICO found that there was no legal basis for the disclosure of data. Therefore, the Northampton Police had the right to rely on the ""neither confirm nor deny"" provisions.

Finally, although the Northampton Police had the right to rely on said provisions, ICO found that it nonetheless breached section 17(1)(b) of the FOIA by failing to specify, in its response to the complainant, the exemption on which it was relying.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 10"
"On 13 June 2019, the complainant asked the Council to have access to various kinds of information related to the LLFA department (funding, qualifications of the staff, headcount etc.). The Council provided some pieces of information, but it did not disclose any information related to the qualifications of the members hired for the LLFA function.

From the complainant point of view, this information would be useful for them to understand the level of experience and technical qualifications held by the LLFA experts, which sometimes provide pieces of advice to the complainant for critical planning decisions.

The Council provided more details on the request (in particular the job profiles for four distinct roles within the team) and confirmed the validity of the hiring process, however it did not grant the access to all the information requested on the exception laid out on section 40(2) of the FOIA.","First, notwithstanding the fact the complainant did not want the names of the LLFA members, the ICO confirmed that the information requested (number of officers in a specific team and which qualifications are held within the team) can be considered personal data related to them.

Then, the DPA evaluated if the disclosure of this information would have been lawful, fair and transparent, according to the Art. 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.

With regards to the lawfulness of the request, one of the legal bases listed in Article 6(1) of the GDPR must apply to the processing. In this case, the Supervisory Authority specified that the 'legitimate interest' (art. 6(1)(f)) would underlie as the most appropriate basis.

Therefore, the ICO proceeded to assess the three-part test (legitimate interest, necessity and balancing tests) to see what would be the outcome.

As mentioned above, the complainant was interested in the expertise of the LLFA staff, which provide support and advice for some critical situations related to the complainant's tasks ('legitimate interest test'). Also, in its view, disclosing this information would be the only way to have access to it ('necessity test').

However, moving to the 'balancing test', the ICO interpreted this to mean that the members of the staff would not have expected that their personal data would be released to the public, in particular after having gone through the Council recruitment process and checks. The Commissioner, therefore, considered that disclosure remains beyond their expectations and would cause them some level of distress.

Taking into account this evaluation, the Authority rejected the request of the complainant and confirmed the choice of the Council to withhold these pieces of information, in the light of the insufficient legitimate interest of the complainant to take priority over the data subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms and in line with its previous decisions (such as FS50819174, FS50849126, FS50668506 and FS50849126).",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The complainant requested information from the Cabinet Office about whether The Queen and the Prime Minister, Boris Jonson had discussed the topics of Brexit or the prorogation of Parliament at their weekly meetings, or had exchanged correspondence on these subjects under The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and The Environmental Information Regulations (EIR).  The Cabinet Office refused to confirm or deny whether it held any information on the basis of section 37(2) by virtue of section 37(1)(a) (communications with the Sovereign),arguing that confirmation or denial would reveal The  Queen's personal data.

The complainant challenged the Cabinet Office’s decision before the ICO.","The ICO held that the Cabinet Office can rely on the section 37 (2) FOIA to deny whether it holds information in the scope of the request; the former defines that information is exempt if it relates to 'communications with the Sovereign' and according to the section 37 (2), the duty to deny does not arise in relations to information which is exempt information defined by subsection 1.

The EIR provides that the duty to confirm or deny whether information is held does not arise if it would contravene any of the principles relating to the processing of personal data set out in Article 5 of the GDPR. The Cabinet Office could rely on that section of the regulation if two conditions are met: if the confirmation or denial  of having information would constitute the disclosure of a third party’s personal data; and providing this confirmation or denial would contravene one of the data protection principles.

The ICO ruled that confirmation or denial whether it held any information, would reveal The Queen’s personal data.  The ICO then has examined if providing The Queen personal data would contravene the data protection principles.  Based on the article 5(1)(a) and 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR, three part test were  considered by the ICO: (i) Legitimate interest test, (ii) Necessity test, (iii) Balancing test. Although, the legitimate interest tests and necessity tests are met, the Commissioner has concluded that The Queen’s interests and rights override the legitimate interests in confirming or denying whether information is held. The ICO has taken into account the consequences of disclosure and a the very significant expectation of The Queen that her communications with the government are confidential.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The Insolvency Services received a request to provide all information regarding two companies it holds on record.  The complainant believed that the Director of an insolvent company had set up a second company with a prohibited name and had requested information about both companies.

Article 216 Insolvency Act prohibits the Director of an insolvent company to use the name of that company in the 12 months leading up to the liquidation.

The Insolvency Service noted that the information it held was already public and that it could not disclose the remainder as it falls under the personal data of an individual (the Director). However, in its communication with the complainant, the Insolvency Services indirectly confirmed that it held more information, by mentioning that the legislation only prevented the directors of the insolvent company from being involved with another company using the same or similar name.

The complainant challenged the way his request was handled by the Insolvency Service before the Information Commission Office.","The Commissioner stated that the information, specifically the confirmation or denial about having more information, in the scope of the request, would fall within the definition of ‘personal data’ defined in section 3(2) DPA: “Any information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual”. The Commissioner explains that an identifiable living individual is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, location data, etc. The confirmation or denial that information was held by the Insolvency Service, not arleady in the public, either way, would involve the disclosure of something about the Director – who is indirectly identifiable from the request.

Providing a confirmation or a denial whether it holds information falling within the scope of the request, the Insolvency Service disclosed the personal data, and therefore, by doing so, it breached data protection principles. Here, the Commissioner referred to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

Moreover, the Commissioner also stated that confirmation or denial, would involve the processing of the criminal offence data in the scope of the request. Referring to Article 10 GDPR, as well as domestic legislation, the Commissioner underlined that by indirectly confirming or denying the information, it confirmed that it had taken steps to establish whether a breach of Section 216 had occurred, by doing so, the Insolvency Service processed and disclosed criminal offence data.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 10"
"A data subject asked the University of London to have access to the names of the examiners who assessed the PhD thesis of President Tsai Ing-wen, the President of the Republic of China, and the date on which the thesis was assessed.

From his point of view, this information would be useful to validate the legitimacy of President Tsai’s  thesis. He was concerned that the thesis was not filed with the LSE’s library until 2019 and that the filed copy appeared to be a 'draft document' and casted doubt on the thesis’ validity. Therefore his request should be accepted for a broad public interest.

The University of London confirmed the validity of the President Tsai’s thesis and provided a link to the copy of the thesis in question, however it didn't grant the access to the personal data requested to the individual under section 40(2) of the FOIA.","The ICO confirmed that the information requested (names of the examiners and date of the thesis' assessment) can be considered personal data related to the President Tsai Ing-wen.

Then, the DPA evaluated if the disclosure of this information would have been lawful, fair and transparent, according to the Art. 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.

With regards to the lawfulness of the request, one of the legal bases listed in Article 6(1) of the GDPR must apply to the processing. In this case, the Supervisory Authority specified that the 'legitimate interest' (art. 6(1)(f)) would underlie as the most appropriate basis.

Therefore, the ICO proceeded to assess the three-part test (legitimate interest, necessity and balancing tests) to see what would be the outcome.

As mention above, the data subject was interested in the legitimacy of President Tsai’s 1984 thesis (legitimate intest test) and, in his view, disclosing the names of the examiners who assessed the thesis, and the date when they ‘signed it off’, would have been necessary to support that the thesis was a valid piece of work (necessary test).

However, The Authority clarified that the fact that the thesis was officially listed in the publicly searchable University library provided the confirmation of a qualification of the President Tsai Ing-wen, thus the disclosure of the requested information would not be necessary for this purpose.

Furthermore, moving to the balancing test, the ICO interpreted this to mean that neither President Tsai nor the examiners would have expected their personal data to be released so many years before the introduction of the FOIA. Whilst President Tsai might reasonably expect this now, in particular in order to end the 'ongoing public controversy' on this topic, the Commissioner considered that disclosure remains beyond the examiners’ expectations. It is therefore possible that disclosing this information would cause them distress.

Taking into account this evaluation, the Authority rejected the request of the data subject and confirmed the choice of the University of London to withhold these pieces of information, in the light of the insufficient legitimate interest of the individual to take priority over the data subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The complainant requested information regarding a grievance process within the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland (the Department) under FOIA. The information included interview notes and statements as well as names, ranks and job roles of interviewees in the evidence gathering process. The Department refused disclosure for reasons of data protection, relying on section 40 (2) FOIA.","The ICO decides that the Department correctly refused to disclose the requested information under section 40(2) FOIA, by way of section 40(3A) a.

The requested information constitutes personal data and can not be anonymised to prevent identification of data subjects from the data released.

The ICO considers Article 6 (1) (f) as a potential basis for processing, confirms legitimate interest and necessity but concludes that the rights and freedoms of the data subjects outweigh the legitimate interest in disclosure. It takes into consideration the extent of a potential disclosure under FOIA (to the wider public), the data subjects’ reasonable expectation of confidentiality and potential stress in case of disclosure.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The complainant requested information relating to a recruitment process within a public authority (the Trust). The Trust withheld parts of the requested information, containing redacted application forms, citing  section 40 (2) FOIA.","The withheld information constitutes personal data and disclosure would be unlawful. Hence, the Trust was right to withhold the information requested under section 40(2) FOIA, by way of section 40(3A)(a).

The ICO saw the particular data subjects’ interests to be protected in the personal statements on the application forms. Even though the names would have been redacted, the candidates’ identity could be derived by a “motivated intruder” using other information publicly available (“mosaic argument”) and therefore constitute personal data.

As regards the breach of data protection principles the ICO refers to Article 5 (1) (a). It then elaborates on the applicability of a legal basis according to Article 6 (1) (f).

The ICO confirms a legitimate interest in that the complainant is concerned about having been discriminated against during the application process.

Furthermore, it deems the potential disclosure of the requested applications necessary to meet this interest.

However, it states that the interest is of a case specific rather than general nature, and concludes that this is easily outweighed by the interests of the data subjects, taking into account the data subjects’ reasonable expectation for their data not to be released and, connectedly, a degree of harm or stress induced by a potential release, in particular since releases under FOIA are releases to the general public.

As regards interests laid out in the Equality Act and fairness of the trial in question, the ICO considers the Trust’s cooperation in releasing all other requested information, which it didn’t deem to be protected by data protection principles, and this to be sufficient evidence of transparency in principle.

Addressing arguments brought by the claimant, the ICO finds that if there was a reasonable expectation by the data subjects for application details to be released, it would increasingly apply to higher ranking posts, and higher than the one in question, for increased relevance of public interest to be taken into consideration.

Furthermore, an analogy to the disclosure of the application forms to the recruitment panel, as brought by the claimant, did not hold, since the applicants would reasonably expect this and have therefore directly or tacitly consented. Also, disclosure to the recruitment panel was less invasive than a release to the wider public under FOIA.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
The complainant had received a letter from the Council regarding a complaint about his dog barking. He requested the name of the person who had submitted the complaint but was refused this information under regulation  13 EIR.,"The Commissioner finds that the Council was correct in withholding the requested information on the basis of regulation 13 EIR.

With reference to the principles laid out in Article 5 (1) (a) GDPR, the Commissioner seeks to determine the lawfulness of a potential disclosure by examining the conditions for legitimate interest according to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

The Commissioner confirms a legitimate interest of the complainant in receiving the requested information, albeit no wider one in the public accessing the information.

Disclosure would also be necessary, including being the least intrusive means to satisfy the legitimate interest specified, she finds.

Crucially, the Commissioner states that in her view “a key issue is whether the individuals concerned have a reasonable expectation that their information will not be disclosed” and whether “disclosure would be likely to result in unwarranted damage or distress to that individual”.

The Commissioner supports the Council’s consideration that complaints to the Council are generally submitted with the expectation of the submitter’s personal information not be released, noting also that a release under EIR would formally be a release into the public domain.

This be supported by the fact that there is no option to submit a complaint to the Council anonymously and that the submission form contains an assurance of confidentiality. This assurance was, in addition, reconfirmed personally to the submitter of the original complaint during the process of further internal investigations into the complaint.

The identity of an individual making a complaint must therefore, and due to the general rationale for and application of the practice of non-disclosure, be subject to the common law duty of confidentiality.

The individual explicitly denied consent for disclosure and, not solely based on this fact, disclosure of their identity would be  “highly likely to cause damage or distress to them […]”

The Commissioner concludes that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual whose data is concerned are not outweighed by the merely personal legitimate interest of the complainant and that accordingly, for lack of a legal basis of processing, and in particular Article 6 (1)(f), disclosure would contravene the principle of lawful processing. On this basis the Council correctly refused disclosure with reference to regulation 13 EIR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"

The Complainants were concerned in particular by the fact that those cameras could be recording images of their own backyard and house.

On 2 May 2019, Y and Z were invited to submit their views to the Icelandic DPA. They explained that the camera in question was a mock-up that could not record any images. After the Icelandic DPA further questioned Y and Z on this camera, the latter admitted that the camera was currently disconnected but that they intended to connect it, and add two additional cameras at least. Y and Z however stressed that they would ensure, at the time of the installation, that the cameras would neither record the public space, nor the private property of the Complainants.

Between October 2020 and August 2021, the Complainants notified the Icelandic DPA that at least four cameras had been installed by Y and Z.  Following further requests from the Icelandic DPA, Y and Z provided the Icelandic DPA with screenshots from all their cameras. Those screenshots showed that the field of vision of the concerned cameras did not extend beyond Y and Z's private property.","Given that the processing of personal data by Y and Z was limited to their private property, and did not extend to the public space of the private property of the Complainants, the Icelandic DPA considered that such processing was falling under the household exemption (Article 2(2)(c) GDPR), and that the GDPR therefore did not apply. For this reason, the Icelandic DPA dismissed the complaint.",COMPLIANT,Article 2

Nine days later, the Complainant was dismissed by Y. The Complainant considered that his dismissal was a direct result of the sharing of information between X (his former institutional employer) and Y (the municipality). Furthermore, his job application with a sub-agency of Y (hereafter, Z) was rejected on the basis of the same information.

The Complainant was of the opinion that X and Y should not have shared and used information about him for the purpose of deciding whether to dismiss him or reject his new job application with Z. In particular, the Complainant considered that X and Y did not have any valid legal basis for the processing of his personal data, and that X and Y had violated the principles of data processing as enshrined in Article 5 GDPR.","The Icelandic DPA considered the processing in question, i.e. the collection, sharing and use, between X and Y,  of the Complainant's personal data for the purpose of human resources management, complied with the applicable data protection law. The  Icelandic DPA therefore rejected the complaint.

In particular:

* the Icelandic DPA found that data relating to the dismissal of a former employee does not qualify as special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR. Hence, it was not necessary for X or Y to justify the processing of such data under Article 9 GDPR (i.e. legal bases for the processing of special categories of data). Rather,  Icelandic DPA found that X and Y could rely on Article 6 GDPR for processing the Complainant's data (i.e. legal bases for the processing of personal data in general).
* the Icelandic DPA rejected the idea that the processing of the Complainant's data should have been based on his consent, in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. Rather, the Icelandic DPA found that, under administrative law, decisions on dismissal of individuals from public offices are generally regarded as administrative decisions. Hence, X and Y could rely on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR for processing such data, in the sense that the processing was necessary for the performance of a task carried out by a public authority in the exercise of its functions. 
* the Icelandic DPA also found that the Complainant had received sufficient information about the fact that data relating to his previous position would be shared with Y. In particular, the Icelandic DPA noted that none of the parties disputed the fact that the Complainant attended a meeting with representatives of Y in June 2018, where the collection of information from X was discussed in the context of a potential dismissal of the Complainant. In addition, the Icelandic DPA considered that it should have been clear to the Complainant that the available information about him could also be used by Y when deciding on the application of the Complainant for a position with Z, i.e. an agency of Y.

The conclusion of the Icelandic DPA was therefore that the processing by X and Y had been conducted in compliance with the applicable data protection legislation.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"In Iceland, the processing of personal data relating to the creditworthiness of individuals is regulated, among others, by Article 2 of Regulation no. 246/2001 as well as Article 15 of the Icelandic Data Protection Act no. 90/2018. In particular, companies willing to publish information relating to the creditworthiness of individuals must first obtain an operating license from the Icelandic DPA, which sets out specific terms for the processing of personal data for the purpose of credit scoring.

Such a license was delivered by the Icelandic DPA to the company Creditinfo on 29 December 2017. According to the terms of this operating license, Creditinfo had to, prior to the publication of any financial data relating to individuals, inform them by sending an information notice by letter. The operating license does not require such letters to be registered letters. The information notice is supposed to give to data subjects the opportunity to present objections (for example, if the data are inaccurate or incomplete, or if a settlement had been reached).

On 28 December 2020, the Icelandic DPA received a complaint from a data subject (hereinafter the Complainant) regarding the publication of information about him in the default register of Creditinfo.  The Complainant claimed that he hadn't received any information prior to the publication of these data, and that, in spite of his erasure request, Creditinfo had refused to delete the concerned data.

Creditinfo, for its part, was arguing that a letter dated March 16, 2020, had been sent to the complainant, and provided evidence thereof  to the Icelandic DPA. Credit info further specified than in case the individual does no longer live at the indicated address, the letter is normally returned, and the address is corrected by taking into account the data of the National Registry. In that case, however, Creditinfo informed the Icelandic DPA that the letter had not been returned.","After analysing the facts of the case, the Icelandic DPA considered that Creditinfo had complied with Article 14 of the GDPR. In particular, the Icelandic DPA noted that Creditinfo had provided sufficient evidence that a letter containing an information notice had been sent to the data subject prior to the publication of the personal data, in accordance with its operating license. The Icelandic DPA therefore concluded that Creditinfo had respected the terms of its operating license, and had not infringed Article 14 GDPR.

With regards to the fact that the Complainant was claiming not having received the letter, the Iceland DPA simply noted that it was not in a position to resolve the dispute regarding this factual aspect of the case but that it could however take a position on whether Creditinfo had complied with the procedure set out in its operating license (which, here, proved to be the case).",COMPLIANT,"Article 14, Article 17"
"The parent of a teenage child (Parent A) filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA regarding the publication of pictures of the child in question on the Facebook page of the other parent (Parent B), as well as on the Facebook page of a third party (the Third Party). The pictures were published together with defamatory comments towards Parent A, due to a dispute between Parent A and Parent B regarding the custody of the child. Parent A wanted to have these pictures removed from Facebook.

In the course of these proceedings, the Icelandic DPA received the views of all the parties involved, including of the child. In particular, the Icelandic DPA contacted the child by telephone and invited him to express his opinion on the publication of the pictures in question on Facebook. The child admitted that he had not been in contact with Parent 2 since the publication of the pictures, but that he would prefer to have them removed from any Facebook's pages, whether public or private.","The Icelandic DPA first stated that the child was identifiable on the pictures, and that the publication of the pictures and the accompanying comments therefore consisted in the processing of personal data under the GDPR.

The Icelandic DPA then considered whether such processing of personal data could fall within the household exemption set in Article 2(2)(c) GDPR. In the affirmative, the processing in question would not be subject to the rules set in the GDPR. The Icelandic DPA pointed out in this respect that the household exemption can only apply in connection with the sharing of personal data on closed social media accounts directed towards the private sphere (that is, accounts which only include a limited number of persons, and are not directed towards the larger public). It was found from the case file and the conducted investigation that the photographs of the child were accessible to all Facebook users, without any specific restrictions. Hence, the exemption to the material scope of the GDPR set in Article 2(2)(c) GDPR could not apply in the case at hand.

The Icelandic DPA then analyzed the relation between freedom of expression on the one hand, and the right to privacy and data protection on the other hand. It considered in particular that, by publishing the pictures in questions, Parent 2 had exercised his/her right to freedom of expression, to alert the public on the difficult situation that he/she was going through with respect to the custody of the child. The Icelandic DPA noted however that freedom of expression is not an absolute right, but may be restricted by law where considered necessary for protecting the rights and interests of others, such as the right to privacy and data protection of Parent 1 and of the child.

By further looking into its tasks and missions as defined in the applicable data protection law, the Icelandic DPA considered that it did not have the power to render a binding decision on the limits of freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Icelandic Constitution, but that such disputes should be subject to judicial review instead.

Based on these considerations, the Icelandic DPA ultimately declared itself incompetent  to rule on whether Parent 1 or the Third Party had exceeded the limits of their freedom of expression when posting the photographs of the child and the accompanying comments on Facebook. The Icelandic DPA therefore rejected the complaint.",COMPLIANT,Article 2
"In 2017, an employee (the Complainant) had been subject to a formal reprimand by his employer (the Company), but had allegedly not been informed about it. Two years later, after being subject to a second reprimand, the Complainant learned about the first formal reprimand against him, and orally requested the Company to provide him with a written copy of it. The Company, however, did not provide him with a written copy of the first reprimand.

In that context, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA against the Company, arguing that the Company had never provided him with a copy of the first formal reprimand against him, despite his (alleged) oral request. The Complainant considered in particular that the Company had acted in violation of the principle of transparency and fairness set in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and of his right to access set in Article 15 GDPR.

In the course of the proceedings, the Company argued that the Complainant had never personally requested a copy of the reprimand, but that his union had done so in January 2021. The Company further explained to the Icelandic DPA that it had complied with that request on the same day, providing as evidence a copy of the e-mail communication between the Company and the union.","Regarding the potential violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, the Icelandic DPA considered that the question whether the Company should have more diligently informed the Complainant about the first reprimand was a matter of labour law rather than a matter of data protection law. Hence, the Icelandic DPA declared itself incompetent to assess whether the (absence of) communication of the first reprimand to the Complainant was violating the principle of transparency and fairness.

Regarding the potential violation of Article 15 GDPR, the Icelandic DPA noted that the Company was disputing the fact that the Complainant had ever submitted an oral request for receiving a written copy of the first reprimand. The Complainant, for his part, was unable to demonstrate that such oral request was ever made. In view of the situation (i.e. the Complaint's word against the Company's word), the Icelandic DPA decided that it was not in a position to appreciate whether there had been a violation of Article 15 GDPR on the part of the Company.

As a result, the Icelandic DPA did not find any violation of the applicable data protection law and closed the case.",COMPLIANT,Article 15
"On January 8, 2020, the DPA received a complaint regarding the claim of Landsbankinn for information on the year-end balance of the complainant's account with Kvika banki in connection with the complainant's request for certain transactions with Landsbankinn.

The complainant had transferred approximately ISK 4 million from Kvika banki hf. to Landsbankinn in December 2019. In January 2020, the complainant requested Landsbankinn to withdraw ISK 3 million in cash.  With reference to the Money Laundering Act, Landsbankinn demanded information on the origin of his funds and requested information on the complainant's account with Kvika banki from the last three years. The complainant considers that it would have been preferable, in order to ensure proportionality in processing, for him to be able to hand over to Landsbankinn, for example, confirmation of the legitimate origin of the capital from Kvika banki.","The DPA concluded that Landsbankinn's processing of personal information about the complainant was permitted on the basis of point 3. Paragraph 1 Article 9 Act no. 90/2018, to the effect that the processing was necessary to fulfill the legal obligation that rests with the responsible party.

In view of the above, the conclusion of the Data Protection Authority is that Landsbankinn's processing of the complainant's personal information was in accordance with Act no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal information.",COMPLIANT,Article 6

"Information on the complainant's legal domicile, contained in the Icelandic National Registry, was disclosed to three banks without the complainant's consent.  The complainant argued that she did not want her address to be made available to third parties on her behalf.  The banks argued that they had a legitimate interest to process this information, because it was necessary for the carrying out of certain activities by the bank, such as transferring money securely online or creating claims via online banking, and and that the data minimisation principle was upheld, i.e. that the personal data processed was adequate, relevant and limited to what was necessary for the purposes of the processing.","The Persónuvernd held that the banks had a legitimate interest to process the domicile information, because the security of the bank's operations online were ""urgently needed"" in light of the financial interest at stake.  The Persónuvernd then concluded that the complainant's interests did not override the banks' legitimate interests because data minimisation had been ensured by the banks' restrictions on who could access the domicile information.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"

The complainant based her complaint on the fact that Lögheimtun ehf. was not permitted to share her personal information with Creditinfo Lánstraust hf. for the purpose of having it registered on the default register and that Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. was not allowed to register the complainant on the default register according to the request of Lögheimtun ehf.","The Icelandic DPA held thatt Lögheimtun ehf. was not permitted to disclose personal information about the complainant from the judgment of the District Court to Creditinfo Lánstraust hf. when the appeal deadline had not expired.

The Icelandic DPA also held that the company could process the data lawfully because an Article 9(2) exception applied, namely Article 9(2)(f), where processing is necessary for the exercise or defence of a legal claim.  However, they rejected the company's contention that the exception of explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) could be relied on in this case, because of the ""clear difference in situation"" between the controller (company) and processor (complainant). In particular, the DPA considered that consent here could not be granted voluntarily, because the compensation settlement was conditional on the complainant granting the company access to their health data.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9"
"The DPA received a complaint from about the processing of personal information about him by Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. (Creditinfo) in connection with the preparation of reports on its creditworthiness.  The complainant had to agree to certain criteria for obtaining Creditinfo 'information in order to be able to view his own credit rating on the company's website, ie. mitt.creditinfo.is. The complainant considered that the information gathering by Creditinfo is too extensive.

Secondly, the complainant pointed out that  Creditinfo used information on obsolete claims and information from the company's debt position system when calculating the complainant's credit rating, including information on his bankruptcy that was already deregistered.

Thirdly, the complainant claimed that he had not received an explanation of his credit rating from Creditinfo and any information about changes in his credit rating during his communication with the company.","The DPA stated that is clear in this case that the preparation of reports on the complainant's credit rating by Creditinfo did not take place in connection with a loan or facility of any kind, but through the complainant himself. More specifically, the case file shows that the complainant logged in to the Creditinfo website, ie. mitt.creditinfo.is, approved the general terms of use and additional terms of the company during the period in question and received its credit rating. It is clear that the complainant agreed to the company's general terms of use on 6 December 2018 and on the same day he agreed to the additional terms of Creditinfo. F According to the DPA, the method used by Creditinfo to offer the complainant acceptance of the additional terms in question has been in an understandable, identifiable and accessible form. Creditinfo was able to show that the consent had been granted and the complainant was able to withdraw his consent at any time, in addition to which the assessment was recalculated according to the terms so that no additional information was used in the calculation. In view of the above, the DPA concluded that Creditinfo's processing of information about the complainant's bankruptcy when making a credit rating about him was in accordance with Act no. 90/2018.

Finally, the DPA assessed that the complainant's right to information according to Art. of the Regulation (EU) was respected when he was provided with information on his credit rating. The processing was therefore in accordance with the second paragraph. Article 17 Act no. 90/2018 and Article 15 of the GDPR.",COMPLIANT,Article 6

The complainant argued that because Creditinfo's rating was based on, among other things, information that was up to four years old, including information on the complainant's temporary financial difficulties, the processing involved in the making of the rating did not comply with data protection rules. Creditinfo disputed this argument.","The Persónuvernd held that the processing was lawful for several reasons. Regarding the GDPR, it held that Article 6(1)(f) applied as a lawful basis for the processing, on the basis that Creditinfo had a legitimate interest in processing the information for the preparation of a report on the complainant's credit rating. It also held that the Article 5(1) principles of transparency, purpose limitation and data minimisation were not violated in this case.

"On 18 December 2019, the DPA received a complaint from regarding the processing of personal information about a data subject by a credit rating company Creditinfo, in connection with the preparation of reports on his credit rating.

According to the complainant, for the purposes of the credit rating, Creditinfo stored and used information about his previous defaults with a bank, despite the fact that they have been settled for a long time. The complainant had requested a correction of the assessment, as he found information on his previous defaults unreliable and misleading. He demanded to stop the processing in the Creditinfo default register and requested information on the method used to calculate his credit rating.

According to Creditinfo, its current operating license states that information on individual debts should be deleted if it is known that they have been returned. Information from the register shall be deleted when it is four years old. The company may store information for additional three years and may use the information to comply with requests from registered individuals. The previous registrations that had affected the complainant's credit rating at the time the complaint was filed were dated 27 June 2017 and 14 June 2018 and were therefore less than four years old. Creditinfo's credit rating assesses the probability of default and registration in the default register over the next twelve months. Statistical predictions for future events must be based on historical information, such as returns and payment history.","The DPA had several times before that Creditinfo was permitted to use information on previous entries in the default register when preparing credit ratings for individuals. Creditinfo was not obliged by law to consider the income and assets of individuals when preparing reports on the creditworthiness of individuals. Regarding the complainant's demands to stop the processing of information about him by Creditinfo, the DPA had previously ruled that such a claim cannot be complied with.

In view of the above, the conclusion of the DPA is that Creditinfo's processing of information on the complainant's previous entries in the default register when making a credit rating about him was in accordance with Act no. 90/2018 on personal protection and processing of personal information.",COMPLIANT,Article 6

"The Bank obtained the Complainant's personal data in connection with the conclusion of an agreement between the aforementioned parties, for the purposes of creditworthiness assessment and risk analysis. The processing of personal data took place even before the entry into force of the GDPR, as it was necessary for the exercise of a right or fulfilment of an obligation arising from a legal provision. After the entry into force of the GDPR, the processing of the applicant's personal data by the bank took place on the basis of Article 6 (1)(b) GDPR and Article 6 (1)(c) GDPR. The Bank transferred the Complainant's personal data to the entity keeping the register of liabilities, on the basis of the Complainant's consent, in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law. The Bank processed the Complainant's personal data in the credit information bureau for the purposes of creditworthiness assessment and credit risk analysis. In view of the Complainant's failure to meet his obligations under the agreements concluded by the Complainant with the bank on time, the Complainant's personal data were also processed without his consent after the expiry of the obligation in question.

The Bank - in accordance with its explanations submitted in these proceedings - indicated that it is currently processing the Complainant's personal data resulting from the aforementioned agreement on the basis of Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR, for the purposes related to the assertion of claims and defence against possible claims related to the performance of agreements concluded by the Complainant with the Bank.

The Complainant argued that the Bank had no legal basis for processing his personal data without the complainant's consent, as the Bank had not lawfully informed him of its intention to process his personal data, which constituted bank secrets, after the expiry of credit obligations without his consent.","The President of the Office for Personal Data Protection refused to grant the request to order the Bank to restore the lawful state of affairs by ordering the Bank to cease processing the Complainant's personal data in third parties (credit information bureaus). At the time the case was resolved, the Bank was already processing the Complainant's personal data only for evidential purposes, resulting from the limitation period for claims. Thus, the basis for processing of the Complainant's personal data by the Bank is currently Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

The President of the Office for Personal Data Protection found that the transfer of the Complainant's personal data by the Bank to third parties took place in 2012 - to the extent resulting from the Applicant's obligation, and thus still during the period in which the previous legal regulation in the field of personal data protection was in force. Making the Complainant's data available to B. was supported by the prerequisite listed in Article 23 par. 1 point 2 of the Personal Data Protection Act of 1997, and for the legality of that making available, in accordance with Article 105 par. 4 of the Banking Law, the Complainant's consent was not required.

At the same time, however, the supervisory authority indicated that the Complainant was right in claiming that the Bank unlawfully processed the Complainant's personal data resulting from the obligations in question in those institutions after the expiry of those obligations. On the basis of the evidence gathered in this case, including in particular the Bank's explanations, it is impossible to conclude unambiguously that the Bank duly notified the Complainant of its intention to process his personal data, constituting banking secrecy, for the purposes of creditworthiness assessment and credit risk analysis also after expiry of the credit obligation.

Printouts from the bank's IT system presented by the Bank certainly cannot be evidence of proper transmission of the above information. In the absence of proof of posting the letter at the postal operator's office, as well as the lack of confirmation of its receipt or its return to the sender because it was not taken by the addressee, it is impossible to conclude that the Bank fulfilled its obligation. Thus, in the opinion of the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection, the processing of the Applicant's personal data after the expiry of the aforementioned obligations was not supported by the applicable provisions of law.

Irrespective of the above, however, it should be explained that at present - in view of the lapse of 5 years from the expiry of the above-mentioned obligations and the correction made by the Bank in B. in the form of the fact that the information concerning the above-mentioned agreement is no longer presented in the reports used for credit risk assessment - the fact of failure to comply with the information obligation towards the Applicant pursuant to Article 105a(3) of the Banking Law should be regarded as irrelevant in this case. Although the Bank's actions actually violated the provisions on personal data protection in this respect, on the basis of the evidence collected in the case, it should be concluded that the state of incompatibility of personal data processing with the law has been removed and is no longer continued.

In the absence of proof of posting the letter at the postal operator's office, as well as the lack of confirmation of its receipt or its return to the sender because it was not taken by the addressee, it is impossible to conclude that the bank fulfilled its obligation.

"Joannahuset (the controller) is a crisis center offering shelter and support to children and young people in vulnerable situations. On one occasion, in connection with obtaining consent for a child's registration for shelter, the controller requested to receive the child's name and social security number via SMS. The Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) became aware of this situation and started an ex officio investigation.

According to the controller, the event occurred in the evening, when the child's custodian was no longer in the office and therefore could only be reached via SMS, and not by secure mail or any other equivalent secure communication method. The controller argued that it was legally obliged to check the identity of the child and receive the custodian's consent before accepting the child to the shelter. If it would not have reached out to the custodian via SMS, the child would have been left to spend the night on the street.","The DPA held that the requirement of appropriate security pursuant to Article 32 GDPR normally implies that the controller must offer the data subject a sufficiently secure communication method when transmitting confidential information. Moreover, the DPA found that the obligations placed on the controller under Article 32 GDPR cannot be waived by the data subject consenting to the unsecure transmission.

However, the DPA found that under exceptional circumstances, data protection requirements can be outweighed by other considerations, including, for example, the need to urgently ensure life and health concerning particularly vulnerable groups of people. Therefore, the controller must conduct a specific assessment and document its considerations when balancing such conflicting interests.

Consequently, the DPA found that in this case it was acceptable to use SMS communication for receiving the child's name and social security number.",COMPLIANT,Article 32

Assuming that the defects were known to the BMW dealership (controller), the data subject requested information about the maintenance and repair history for the vehicle's entire lifecycle.

When assessing the controller's response, the Finnish DPA checked whether the vehicle's service history was personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR. It also analysed whether it would be the personal data of the new owner, giving them the right to access this information under Article 15 GDPR.","The DPA held that the vehicle maintenance and repair history might directly or indirectly describe the activities of the vehicle's owner or holder. For example, it may tell how the owner used the vehicle, including its running distance and the owner's driving style. In addition, although the service history usually does not indicate the owner's name, the person can be identified when combining information from other sources, such as a public transportation registry. Hence, the DPA considered that the vehicle service history information relates to an identifiable natural person and thus is personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR. Nevertheless, this information may also include non-personal data to which the GDPR does not apply.

Finally, the vehicle service history information cannot be considered the new owner's personal data due to the minimal effect this information has on them. Consequently, the DPA held that the new vehicle owner does not have the right to access this information under Article 15 GDPR when the information relates to another person. However, under other grounds, such as legitimate interest, the controller could still disclose this information to new buyers if it wished to.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 15"
"The controller is media outlet De Tijd. The data subject had an electric scooter business that was acquired by another company in 2018.

The controller published an article about the data subject and his (previous) business, which is now in its online archives. The data subject asked the controller to anonymize the article. The controller refused.

On 23 March 2021, the data subject submitted a request for mediation to the DPA about the controller's refusal to honor their right to be forgotten. The data subject stated that the article had a negative connotation (even after a revision of inaccuracies at their request). Furthermore, the article would pop up when you searched their same on a search engine, which hurt their professional career.

The controller stated that it is not obligated to remove or anonymize the article, based on the freedom of expression and the integrity of media archives. As for the negative connotation, it followed that the way an article is written falls under editorial freedom. Moreover, the data subject actively sought out and profited from the media attention.","The DPA noted that the right to be forgotten (Article 17(1) GDPR) is not applicable when processing is necessary to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information (Article 17(3)(a)). It explained that balance must be found between the freedom of expression of information and the right to protection of personal data.

The DPA agrees with the data subject that the inclusion of an article in name-based search results may constitute a more serious interference with the right to privacy, since it is more accessible and can play a decisive role in the spread of that information. However, the data subject did not address a search engine, but an online archive. The DPA will therefore only address the applicability of Article 17(1)(c) and it's exception laid down in Article 17(3)(a).

The DPA stated that the freedom of expression and  journalistic liberty (Article 10 ECHR) are an important pillar in a democratic society. Online archives specifically are of special importance because of their accessibility to the general public. Only very pressing reasons justify an intervention with these fundamental rights. The mere fact that an article has negative connotation is not sufficient to compromise the integrity of online archives. The DPA further noted that the article has societal relevance (for investors and entrepreneurs) contained no factual inaccuracies. In addition, the data subject could reasonably expect media attention, as he initiated contact with them. Lastly, access to the article was limited to subscribers. The DPA thus found the processing in line with the adequate measures of Article 89 GDPR.

The DPA therefore held that the controller lawfully refused the data subject's request for erasure pursuant to Article 17(3)(a).",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 89"
"The data subject complained to the Spanish DPA that a neighbor in their building had installed a doorbell camera that captured part of a common area. They did not know what their neighbor did with the recorded images but worried their 16-year-old daughter and another neighbor's 10-year-old grandson being recorded on the way to lay out or hang laundry on the landing.

The owner of the camera claimed to have installed it in response to their door being vandalized, and the complainant themselves acknowledged that the door had suffered various scratches.","The DPA held that there was no data processing in the facts presented and that intervention would only be necessary if improper use of the recordings infringed on data privacy rights. The DPA analogized the doorbell camera to a traditional front door peephole, noting that such peepholes are not generally seen as invasive. Because there was no expectation of privacy in the common area immediately outside a neighbor’s front door, a doorbell camera was a reasonable and proportional step to deter further vandalism.

The DPA recommended that the neighbors resolve their disagreements according to “the minimum rules of good neighborliness” or else settle them in an appropriate judicial framework.",COMPLIANT,Article 5
"The controller is the Belgian tax authority (Algemene Administratie van de Bijzondere Belastinginspectie). The complainant provides tax advice services. The data subjects are (1) the complainant (hereinafter: Tax Advisor) and its (2) customers (hereinafter: Customers).

The Tax Advisor was involved in a criminal investigation into tax fraud, forgery of documents, and the use of false documents. The investigation was still pending when the DPA issued the decision.

The controller used the Tax Advisor’s criminal records for an investigation into tax evasion of his Customers. These documents only contained personal data of the Customers. The controller’s notice to the Customers of the investigation contained the Tax Advisor’s personal data (full name; address; data of birth).

The Tax Advisor issued a complaint with the DPA for unlawful processing of personal data. He stated that it damaged his reputation and breached his clients' confidentiality, which cost him customers.

Regarding the data from his criminal records, the Tax Advisor stated that it did relate to him because (1) he processed it in the context of his independent professional activity and (2) it was obtained from his criminal records. He further argued that customer data is covered by professional secrecy and thus cannot be processed for tax purposes.

The controller stated that the notice to the Customers, on its own, did not fall under the definition of 'filing system' under Article 4(6). Therefore the GDPR was not applicable.","The DPA noted that a complaint by someone other than the data subject can be admissible if they have a sufficient interest (Article 58 WOG). Sufficient interest is present if the complainant's interest in some way relates to the interest of the data subjects (mere commercial interest is not enough). The DPA found that the Tax Advisor's interest was purely commercial and thus, not sufficient.

The DPA also disregarded the Tax Adviser's argument that the data obtained from his criminal records is covered by professional secrecy. The DPA noted that only the judge on the merits can decide on a breach of professional secrecy. As this did not happen (yet), it cannot examine whether the acquisition of data by the controller was in accordance with the GDPR.

Regarding the controller’s notice to the Customers, the DPA held that, contrary to the controllers argument, the GDPR was applicable. The notice is part of a tax file that is managed by controller, which makes it part of a filing system as described in Article Article 4(6). However, the DPA refrained from ruling on the lawfulness of the processing of that data, as they were already the subject of pending legal proceedings as part of the main dispute.

The DPA therefore held that the complaint was inadmissible.",COMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 4, Article 55, Article 57"
"The controller was a local pub with surveillance cameras on its exterior. The complainant alleged that the controller had these cameras installed for ""many months"" without putting up signs that warned passersby and disclosed the contact details of the controller. The controller had been the subject of previous claims for the same alleged violation.

The controller responded that the complaint was filed by the same neighbor who had filed the first complaint, and it was filed the same day their GDPR-compliant signs had been stolen. The signs had been stolen three times. Because of the minimal value of the signs (roughly €7), the controller had not filed a police report, but they provided invoices from the copy shop where they had replacements printed.","The DPA noted that, in cases of video surveillance, Article 22.4 LOPDGDD provides that the duty of disclosure in Article 12 GDPR may be fulfilled by placing a sign near surveillance cameras that identifies the existence of data processing, the identity of the controller, and the possibility of exercising the rights forseen in Articles 15 to 22 GDPR. Failure to provide this information constitutes a ""serious infraction"" per Article 83.5 GDPR.

However, the DPA held that the controller could not be sanctioned per Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Regime Legal of the Public Sector (Responsibility), which requires that only parties responsible for an adiminstrative infraction by way of fraud or negligence be subject to sanction. The DPA reasoned that because the controller had failed to comply only as a result of repeated acts of vandalism and had quickly acted to remedy the infraction after each incident, there was no fraud or negligence on the part of the controller.",COMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 12"

Articles were published about these legal matters, which were found in search results in association with the data subject's name. The data subject asked the DPA to order the controller to remove these URLs, exercising his right to be forgotten (Article 17(1) GDPR).

The data subject claimed that the court proceedings were fully settled, resulting in an acquittal. Furthermore, he stated that they were outdated. The data subject therefore argued that there was thus no public interest concerning the right to freedom of information and journalism with regard to this articles.

The Controller stated that there was a public interest in the articles, as they related to conduct of serious criminal relevance committed by the data subject and in respect of which 'the outcome of the trial is unclear.'","The DPA found that, other than the data subject argued, the acquittal only related to a part of the charges. Furthermore, the articles in question also referred to other allegations against the data subject, in respect of which the judicial proceedings had not yet been concluded.

"The controller was an insurer, and the data subject was one of their policy holders. In 2012, the data subject subject suffered a whiplash injury in a car accident and was later diagnosed with ""post-traumatic depressive adjustment disorder with somatization."" In 2014, the data subject filed a claim with the controller for occupational disability; the data subject had been self-employed as a management consultant and energy technician. The controller rejected the claim on the basis that the data subject had not provided adequate proof of disability. On October 28, 2015, the data subject applied to the district court of Wels for a conditional payment order to be issued against the controller. At the time of the DPA's decision, the civil proceedings were suspended. In 2016, the controller offered the data subject a one-time payment of €25,000, which the data subject rejected. The insurance contract between the two parties was terminated in October 2017.

On May 13, 2019, the data subject emailed an access request, requesting specifically the ""risk assessment"" associated with her contract and the ""reserve amount"" associated with her disability claim. In a response dated Nobember 27, 2019, the controller asked the data subject for an explanation of what she meant by those terms. On April 26, 2020, the data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA alleging that the controller had violated her right of access and additionally requested all of her personal data processed by the controller. The controller responded that it had answered the data subject's access request to the best of its ability and that the terms she used were not meaningful to the firm. The controller claimed the data subject believed she was entitled to an insurance payout and was abusing data protection law for her benefit in the related civil procedure. As the complaint was the first time the data subject had requested all her personal data, the controller sent a 200-page response including among others her tariff type, the surrender value paid out, her responses on a medical questionaire, and payment history.

The data subject disagreed that this information was comprehensive, insisting that, because the controller had offered her a settlement, it must have calculated a case-related accrual amount. The controller denied this, explaining that accrual amounts were calculated in aggregate, not on a specific, case-by-case basis. On June 7, 2021, the DPA rejected the data subject's complaint because it had responded to her access request with all the information available to it; the missing information she continued to request was never available to the controller. The data subject appealed, requesting an on-site investigation of the data held by the controller.","The DPA rejected the data subject's appeal. It concluded that the data subject's complaint was based on the alleged incompleteness of the controller's response to her access request, missing an assessment of the subject's health. The DPA noted that, in regards to the missing health data, the controller had supplied the data subject with the only information it had, which were the questionaires and medical documents she had personally submitted.

Regarding the calculation of the offered settlement, the DPA held that these calculations were trade secrets under the DSG because they were secret, had commercial value, and were protected with appropriate confidentiality measures. Article 15(4) GDPR provides that the right to access is not absolute and that access requests shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, and Article 4(6) DSG specifically makes exception for business or trade secrets. The DPA held that the controller had in fact provided all the personal data it had on the data subject and was not obliged to share the process by which it assessed this information and calculated the settlement it offered her.

The rejection of the data subject's appeal was deemed final, as the legal situation was sufficiently clear as to not cause any difficulty in interpretation.",COMPLIANT,Article 15
"The data subject gambled online on the website of a gambling company (hereinafter: company B), established in Malta. When the data subject lost some money, he demanded a refund from company B, claiming that the company's online gambling services were illegal, at least in Austria from where the data subject accessed the online casino. Company B then refunded the money.

The data subject later opened account with a different online gambling company (hereinafter: company C), which was a part of the same group of companies as company B. The data subject once again demanded a refund of his losses. He based it on the same claim as before: alleged illegality. However, company C refused to give a refund. The data subject then brought the dispute to court.

Company C wanted to defend itself in the legal proceedings by demonstrating that the data subject abused his rights by claiming refunds whenever he lost money. For this reason, company B transferred the data subject's personal data to company C. The personal data concerned the data subject's previous refund claim at company B. Company C then transferred this data to the law firm representing it in the legal proceedings (the controller).

As a result, the data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA against the controller about the use of his personal data in the court proceedings. He stated that the exchange of personal data from company B to company C was neither covered by the privacy policy of company B nor did he give consent to it. The data was therefore unlawfully processed by the controller in the court proceedings against company C.","The DPA held that the processing of the personal data by the controller was lawful pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as it was necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by a third party. The court used Article 9(2)(f) GDPR to interpret legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as including the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

When conducting the balancing test under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, the DPA pointed out that the data subject had an interest in the confidentiality of his data and and in preventing the controller from making a factual submission that could damage his own success in the proceedings. These interests of the data subject had to be balanced against the legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by a third party, being the interest in access to evidence and the right to present it. In the case at hand, the DPA concluded that the interest of the controller outweighed the interest of the data subject. Consequently, the controller could rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for processing.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9"
"The data subject exercised their right to erasure by requesting Google LLC (controller) to de-index search results of four URLs that contained their personal data. The controller rejected this request twice. The data subject then filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA. During the investigation, the controller reconsidered and removed two of the four URLs. The two remaining URLs concerned an employee selection process at the State General Administrative Body. A provisional list of candidates and assessments relating to the selection process were published on the body's website.

The controller stated that the two remaining URLs referred to information that was of public interest. It argued that institutional websites play an important role in keeping citizens informed on matters of interest to them. The information there should therefore be accessible without restrictions. The controller further argued that the CJEU had held that search results should only be de-indexed after a balancing test of the rights at stake, namely the right to be forgotten and freedom of information. The right to be forgotten cannot imply a retrospective censorship of information correctly published at the time.","The DPA noted that under Article 17(3)(b) GDPR, personal data shall not be erased if their processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation imposed by Union or Member State law. Pursuant to Spanish Law 39/2015 on administrative procedures, administrative acts shall be published (1) if this is laid down in the rules of procedure or (2) when the competent body deems it appropriate for reasons of public interest.

The DPA held that the accessibility of publications on the website of a public institution guarantees legal certainty and administrative transparency. Therefore, it may be in the public interest to not de-index the URLs. Thus, Google LLC could reject the de-indexing requests on this basis.

The DPA consequently dismissed the data subject's claim with respect to the two remaining URLs.",COMPLIANT,Article 17
"On 17 January 2022, A.A.A. (the complainant) filed an access request against ESCO EXPANSION, S.L.. On 18 January 2022, the complainant received a call informing that their request would be transferred to CAIXABANK, S.A (the controller) who was responsible for the corresponding procedure.

The complainant requested access to the phone call, to whose recording they could not object. In response, the controller provided only a transcript of the phone conversation. Consequently, the complainant sent another letter specifically requesting a ""copy of the call"".  The controller explained that the recording could not be provided and must be requested from superior instances.

Since the requests of the complainant were not fulfilled, on 26 January 2022, they started a claim against the controller before the Spanish DPA. The complaint was based on two grounds. First, in what format should the copy of the phone call be provided. Second, whether the controller had lawfully recorded the call.","First, the Spanish DPA emphasised that the voice constitutes personal data as it renders a person identifiable and, therefore, is protected under the GDPR and Spanish law. At the same time, recordings of phone calls also contain information about third parties, which cannot be disclosed without a valid legal basis. The DPA concluded that since the controller provided a transcript of the recording, the right of access as provided for in Article 15 GDPR and Article 13 LOPDGDD was exercised.

Secondly, the DPA noted that a valid legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR is required in order to record a phone call without the consent of the data subject. In the present case, the recording was necessary for the performance of a contract.  Hence, the recording of the phone call with the complainant was lawful and did not require their consent.

"The Croatia DPA received a complaint in which, in essence, the complainant pointed out that a real estate agency (the controller) published their photograph taken during a viewing of an apartment that was advertised for sale, without their consent and knowledge. The photo was available on a public website via an URL link.

At the request of the Croatian DPA, the controller stated that they deleted, in good faith, the disputed parts of the photo allegedly representing the complainant. At the same time, the controller argued that they did not believe that, in this case, it was about the complainant's personal data, since the person in the initial photograph was camouflaged in a jacket and a protective face mask. Moreover, the person voluntarily entered the frame during the photo shoot.","The Croatian DPA rejected the complaint as unfounded. It pointed out that it was not possible to determine the data subject's identity from the contested photo. In particular, the assessment of identity should be based on objective and reasonable factors so that the average person could determine in an unequivocal way (directly/indirectly) the identity of an individual.

The DPA concluded that the identity of the applicant was impossible to determine by objective factors available to the average person, who was not an acquaintance of the complainant, from just looking at the attached photo. The photo was not clear and the face was not visible (mostly covered by a surgical mask).

Therefore, the photograph in question could not be referred to as personal data in the sense of Article 4(1) GDPR, so there was no obligation of the controller to delete the photograph. It was only about publishing a photo of a property intended for sale and did not contain personal data.",COMPLIANT,Article 4
"On 12 December 2020, the Icelandic DPA received a complaint from a Danish organization ""Patientforeningen,"" representing a data subject. The complaint  concerned a letter from the Danish Biobank addressed at the data subject, which stated that the body tissues collected from the data subject were sent to deCode Genetics in Iceland to be processed and stored by deCode Genetics.  The complaint pointed out that according to the website of the research project, the Capital Region of Denmark is the controller and deCode Genetics is the processor of the processing.

The complaint contended the following:

1. The processing of personal data in Iceland is without authorization.

2. The personal data in question is outside the scope of data protection impact assessment (DPIA) carried out in Denmark. Moreover, it is unclear whether deCode Genetics carried out any DPIA.

3. The genetic information is processed without the permission of the Central Scientific Ethics Committee in Iceland.

4. The processing of genetic data is done without permission from the Icelandic DPA.

The complaint claimed that although the agreement between Danish Biobank and deCode Genetics stated deCode Genetics to be the processor, it was in fact acting as a controller and thus had to be responsible for the obligations of a controller. This claim was on the basis that the articles published regarding the research identified individuals from deCode Genetics as first and last authors. Usually in the scientific community, the first author is the real contributor, and hence the main decision authority.

In reply, deCode Genetics claimed that it is the Danish DPA which has the jurisdiction since the data subject is Danish and the data is primarily registered and stored in Denmark. deCode Genetics submitted that the Danish DPA was already looking into similar cases and hence is the most appropriate authority. deCode Genetics cited its other collaborative research projects and claimed that it was recognized as a processor in them. It claimed that this project, for which it is the processor, was approved by the Danish Scientific Ethics Committee. It also stated that it had carried out its obligations as a processor as mentioned in Article 28 GDPR, and had submitted the requisite information to the appropriate medical facility in the Capital Region of Denmark. With respect to the lack of approval from Icelandic authorities, deCode Genetics claimed that in multinational research, permission is sought from those authorities where the research population and the person responsible for research are located. It submitted that this principle is applicable even when a part of the processing is carried out in another country.","The Icelandic DPA held the following:

First, the data is personal data as per Article 4(1) GDPR despite the fact that the data is associated with artificial identifiers, because it is known that artificial identifiers can be connected with real individuals at the medical facilities of the capital region of Denmark.

Second, the processing by the personnel of deCode Genetics for the research projects with the Capital Region of Denmark, will be governed by Danish law because Danish law allows scientific research in collaboration with others and because the studies had received permission from the Danish Scientific Ethics Committee.

Third, persons who study data and draw conclusions from it cannot be impliedly held responsible for its processing. A person responsible for medical research, might not be the responsible person under the data protection law. The agreement of the Capital Region of Denmark with deCode Genetics identified deCode Genetics as the processor. The fact that personnel of deCode Genetics are authors of scientific articles pertaining to the research will not make deCode Genetics a controller. deCode Genetics carried out its duties as a processor, and the DPIA as per Article 35 GDPR has to be carried out by the controller and not the processor.

Thus, the processing of personal data is compatible with GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 28"
"The data subject previously served as a board member and a managing partner in two companies (controllers). After the sale of the companies, the acquiring entity initiated a civil lawsuit against, among others, the data subject. The dispute concerned alleged manipulation of accounting and thus overrated value of the acquired businesses.

On 16 February 2021, the data subject exercised their right under Article 15 GDPR and requested access to information about them from the controllers. The request related to information about the data subject's work and the ongoing legal proceedings.

First, the controllers extended the request processing time by two months because of the high volume and complexity of the requested information. Later, on 18 May 2021, the controllers provided the data subject with 66 documents relating to travel planning, practical matters related to the board meetings, know-your-customer (KYC) information, separate documents with e-mail logos and a few personal e-mails regarding dinner and sports. Unsatisfied with the response, the data subject complained to the DPA on the same day.","The DPA limited its decision to the content of the controller's reply to the data subject access request and did not consider whether they replied within the time limits set out in Article 12(3) GDPR.

Then, the DPA held that the large number of documents which could contain information about the data subject essentially related to the controllers where the data subject worked as a board member and a managing partner, as well as to ongoing legal proceedings. In this respect, the DPA assumed that any personal information from those documents appeared to be an ""accessory"" to the processing purpose (in this context, business operations) and thus must be considered as describing the function that the data subject performed.

Moreover, the data subject did not specify their request enough for the controller to reduce the number of documents to check. As a result, responding to the request would require the identification, collection, review and assessment of more than one million documents distributed among different controllers to determine whether personal data about the data subject would have to be handed over.

Consequently, the DPA held that the controllers were not obliged to search for and review the documents to identify and hand over information about the data subject because the request was excessive, according to Article 12(5)(b) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,Article 12
"A construction company, the first controller, carried out work in the warehouse of the data subject. In order to show the results of its work, the first controller uploaded on its website photographs published on another ocmpany's, the second controller, website, which portrayed the construction site. In one of the photographs, the data subject was sitting behind a glass door with coloured squares partially covering their face and body. The photo was published by the first controller without the data subject's consent.

Subsequently, the data subject requested access to their data from the first controller. However, since they did not receive a response, the data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA. The first controller claimed that the photograph tried to show the result of the works of construction carried out in a building owned by the data subject. To do so, it re-used the photos from the second controller's website, with its consent. Accordingly, it was the second controller who should have asked the data subject for consent before further processing.

The Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the second controller who claimed that the publication of that photo did not involve processing of personal data and that they had not authorised the use of that photograph nor communicated any personal data belonging to the data subject to the first controller.","First, the DPA recalled that according to Article 4(1) GDPR the image of a person constitutes personal data because it reflects distinctive features, such as height or style, that help the association with a concrete individual. Moreover, a photo can inform about the age, gender or ethnicity, making the identification of a person easier. The DPA referred to Article 4(2) GDPR which defines the concept of processing. Publishing a person's image on websites must be regarded as processing of personal data.

Second, it was noted that the photograph did not portray the data subject entirely. With regards to this, national case law (Judgement of the Supreme Court of 12 July 2004, 1702/2000) interpreted that a photo of someone whose face is not visible but could still be identified by their contour may lead to a breach of their fundamental right to privacy.

Finally, since the photos were removed from the website as a result of another proceeding involving the controller, the Spanish DPA recalled Article 19 GDPR, which sets out the obligation to notify the rectification or erasure of personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed. In this case, the second controller had deleted the data in the course of the proceedings but did not inform the first controller, as a recipient of the photo, about the erasure.

Having analysed the case, the Spanish DPA dismissed the complaint against the second controller as there was not enough evidence of the first controller communicating to the second controller the publication of the photographs on its website. However, the DPA noted ex officio that the second controller acted in violation of Article 19 GDPR by not informing the recipients that the photo had been deleted.",COMPLIANT,Article 19
"The data subject was the patient of a gynecologist (the controller), who owned a private practice, and requested access to their medical records. The requested documentation related to the data subject's maternity care and pregnancy, which ended in the death of the fetus. Within a span of two months, the data subject sent two letters requesting a copy of the records, both with no response. Consequently, they lodged a complaint with the Hungarian DPA in order to obtain access to the data.

The DPA initiated a procedure and asked the controller to clarify the facts of the case. The controller responded that it managed the practice without any administrative help and due to the Covid-19 pandemic, struggled with minor administrative shortcomings. Consequently, it did not become aware of the data subject's request on time. The controller largely relied on paper records rather than an electronic patient database and only maintained the statutory mandatory electronic records. At the request of the DPA, the controller provided a copy of the documents, signed and sealed, to the data subject. However, the file was not complete as several medical test results were missing. The data subject requested the DPA to order the controller to send a copy of the missing records.

The DPA examined whether the controller acted lawfully in considering the request for access to medical records. The DPA also examined ex officio the general data management practices of the controller.","First, the DPA recalled that the GDPR defines data relating to the health and healthcare of a data subject as personal data, including special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR.

Second, the DPA noted that maintaining paper records is still considered processing of personal data under the GDPR if the data are part of a filing system, in line with Article 2(1) GDPR. Article 4(6) GDPR defines a filing system as ""any structured set of personal data, which are accessible according to specific cirteria"". Accordingly, the DPA held that, in the present case, the patient files maintained by the controller in the context of providing private healthcare fell within the scope of the GDPR.

Third, the DPA noted the obligations of the controller under Articles 12(2) and 15 GDPR to provide the details of the right to access as well as a copy of the requested data. Respectively, the copies of medical records sent to the data subject were not complete and the controller did not respond at all to two consequtive requests. The DPA pointed out that, according to the principle of accountability in Article 5(2) GDPR, the controller is responsible for compliance with the GDPR and must be able to demonstrate it.

Fourth, the DPA noted that, contrary to the requirements of Article 13(1)(a)(b) GDPR, it was difficult to find the correct address for submissions of access requests because the controller's Privacy Notice with contact information was not provided to the data subject.

Fifth, the DPA took a closer look at the controller's documentation practices. In this context, the DPA indicated that the controller was unclear about how it stored patients' data. First, it had stated that it did not keep electornic records. Later, the controller stated that it created electronic records when required by national law. Therefore, the controller was not transparent with regards to the means of processing personal data, in breach of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

The Hungarian DPA had to reject the data subject's request to order the controller to submit the missing documents as they turned out to be missing from the medical documentation overall. However, on its own initiative, the DPA concluded that the controller did not ensure an effective exercise of data subject rights in violation of Articles 12(2) and 13(1)(a)(b) GDPR. The controller also did not process personal data in a transparent manner in violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The DPA imposed a €1,400 fine for these violations.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 15"

The LSA Sweden conducted the investigation and the cooperation procedure in accordance with Article 60 GDPR and proposed a Draft Decision which dismissed / rejected the complaint. In accordance with Article 60(8) GDPR, the Berlin DPA, as the supervisory authority with which the complaint was lodged, adopted the Swedish decision.

According to the Swedish decision, Klarna, the controller, received an access request by the complainant on 6 June 2021. Klarna's customer service requested the complainant to complete their request with information regarding the complainant’s identity and requested the complainant’s telephone number in order to send a data access verification code. The complainant then provided the information regarding identity without giving a telephone number. On 17 June 2021, the complainant requested that the request be dealt with by 19 June 2021.

The register extract with password was sent to the complainant on 12 July 2021.

The complainant is of the opinion that Klarna did not follow their duties according to Article 15 GDPR by replying to the request in time. Klarna was late in responding to the access request. Klarna considers that the extract of the register has been submitted within the time frame set out in Article 12(3) GDPR after the complainant has provided the necessary information regarding their identity.","The Swedish DPA pointed out that Article 12(3) GDPR requires the controller to provide the data subject, upon request, without undue delay and in any event no later than one month after receiving the request, with information on the actions taken pursuant to Article 15 GDPR. Further, the one-month time limit may be extended by a further two months where the request is particularly complex or the number of requests received is high. If the time limit of one month is extended, the controller shall inform the data subject of the extension.

However, the DPA also noted that, as is clear form Article 12(6) GDPR, where the controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the natural person making a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 21 GDPR, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject. In light of the facts, the DPA considered that Klarna had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the appellant and had adequately requested proportionate information without undue delay. Since the complainant did not submit that information until 24 June 2021, the time limit did not start to run again until then. Furthermore, the PDA considered that Klarna has handled the request without undue delay through the total 23 days.

The DPA held against this background that the investigation in the case does not show that the controller has processed the complainant’s personal data in breach of Articles 12(3), 12(6) and 15 GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 60"
"On 24 November 2021 and 15 February 2022, a data subject complained to the Icelandic DPA regarding the processing of personal data by a controller, Íslandspóstur, i.e. the Icelandic postal authority. The data subject alleged that the controller maintained a special register of stamp collectors, including the data subject. The  allegation was based on the claim that all postage to the data subject from abroad was subjected to customs check, regardless of whether it was general or traceable letters. In reply, the controller stated that it was not maintaining a special register. It also stated that, as per law, all shipments to Iceland are subject to customs duties and, as a customs broker, the postal authority is required to do customs processing. In addition, the controller added that with experience the employees of the postal authority gain knowledge about assessing high-value items.","The Icelandic DPA noted that Article 4(1) GDPR applies to ""the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system."" It added that there was no evidence of a special register for stamp collectors and that, therefore, also no evidence existed for GDPR-infringing personal data processing. Thus, the DPA rejected the complaint. The DPA did not consider it necessary to use its additional powers to carry out any further investigations.",COMPLIANT,Article 2
"The data subject’s parent (claimant) submitted a complaint before the Spanish DPA stating that images of the data subject, a minor below 16 years old, were published on a pornographic website. The claimant added that those photos were manipulated by taking the data subject’s face and putting it on naked bodies. In addition, the claimant had already reported the facts to the police and requested the deletion of the material from the website with no answer from them.

The Spanish DPA started an investigation proceeding according to Articles 57(1) and 58(2) GDPR for the processing of personal data without the consent of the data subject, as foreseen in Article 6 GDPR.

Firstly, the DPA found out that the request to the website did not expressly asked for the exercise to the right to erasure of Article 17 GDPR, however, the photos were deleted from the website.

Secondly, the police sent the file to a court which started an investigation and finally closed the case due to the lack of evidence to assign the authorship of the crime to a particular person. The court had requested information regarding the IP addresses from the website, whose representative stated that they acted as an archiving service for content and public information from another website without keeping any type of information from their users except for an email address. However, they were able to delete the content in question. After visiting the other website, no material related to the investigation was found.

Finally, the DPA proceeded with the search on Google for all the photos from the investigation with no results.","Having analysed the case, the Spanish DPA dismissed the complaint since, as a result of the investigation, it was not possible to assign the authorship of illegal processing to a particular person, considering that the investigating court closed the case for the same reason. Furthermore, the DPA held that the request to exercise the right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR) was observed since the photos had been deleted from the website.

In addition, the DPA highlighted that the publication of images of persons in videos or news available on the internet constitutes the processing of personal data and the person who does it must rely on one of the legal basis of Article 6 GDPR. Consent being the most common legal basis, the controller must hold evidence of that consent.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17"
"The data subject logded a complaint with the Spanish DPA against Banco de Sabadell, the controller, whose main establishment is located in Spain. The complaint was based on the right of access executed by the data subject and the fact that the controller handed over a copy containing only the personal data from the data subject’s file and not the detailed transactions from the account.

Next, the complaint was sent to the Spanish DPA through a system aimed for cross-border administrative cooperation and mutual assistance between the Member States and according to Article 56(1) GDPR, due to the cross-border character of the complaint and the competence of the Spanish DPA as lead supervisor authority.

Under Article 60 GDPR, the following DPAs were identified as “concerned supervisory authorities” under Article 4(22) GDPR: the Netherlands, Italy, France and Portugal, since data subjects who reside on their territory might be substantially affected by the processing analysed in this case. On the other hand, the Polish DPA also claimed interest since the controller operated on its territory.

The controller claimed that the data subject did not specify the extent of the request in the sense of detailing either the data, purpose or processing operation which they wanted to access. Additionally, the controller interpreted the request as a demand for the “personal data used by the bank”, considering firstly, the information already provided on the website and in the contract according to Article 13 GDPR and, secondly, to avoid that the right to access results in excessive data disclosure, considering the amount of data handled.

Furthermore, in the same document, the controller provided information regarding the application “Banca a distancia” (long-distance banking) which allows to visualise and check the movements and operations on the account. The controller also stated to be at the client’s disposal to extend or clarify the request. Finally, the controller proceeded to hand over a copy containing all the information requested by the data subject.","In the first place, the Spanish DPA proposed the dismissal of the complaint to which the French DPA objected.

However, the Spanish DPA confirmed that the data subject did not specify the personal data expected, the controller attended to the request by providing a copy containing the personal data from the data subject’s file, and the same document communicated the possibility to extend the information. Moreover, the data subject had access to a secure and easy-access tool to get the information requested. The French DPA did not object this time.

The Spanish DPA also observed that with the second communication, on 1 September 2020, the controller satisfied the access request. Therefore, in case of a violation of Article 15 GDPR, that would be prescribed according to Article 74 of the national data protection law as the complaint was submitted on 7 February 2020.

Finally, the complaint was dismissed as unfounded. The Spanish DPA ordered to notify the controller of this outcome.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 15, Article 56, Article 60"
"A picture of the data subject's house was used in a news article about a 'lock-down' party. This article was posted on the website of a newspaper (controller). The data subject first contacted the newspaper and requested the removal or correction of the article. According to the data subject, it contained several mistakes, such as the fact that the lock-down party had not taken place in this house. He also stated that the publication of the photo was in essence the same as the publication of his address. As a result, he was discredited by the local community and received hateful messages on social media.

The data subject also contacted the controller's DPO, requesting it to either delete the published information or to correct it. The data subject specifically requested the deletion of the photo of his house, as he felt that it was disproportionate and not necessary for the article. The controller responded that after looking into the matter with the journalist, it confirmed that the information was in the article was in fact accurate.","The DPA dismissed the complaint for reasons of expediency pursuant to Article 95(1)(3) LCA (Act establishing the data protection authority). Despite the presence of elements that could lead to a sanction, the DPA did not deem further investigation of the case appropriate in the light of the priorities as illustrated in its Discontinuance Policy.

The DPA stated it would balance the personal impact for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject against the effectiveness of action taken by the DPA, in order to decide if it was expedient to continue the proceedings.

Erasure request and balancing exercise

The DPA stated that the request of the data subject was a request for erasure from an online archive, belonging to a press organisation. The DPA reiterated that Article 89 GDPR acknowledged the importance of processing personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest. The DPA also stated that, according to the case law of the CJEU, internet archives were protected under Article 10 ECHR and Article 11 of the Charter. The DPA also added the GDPR provided an exception to its own, specifically Article 17(3)(a) GDPR, ⁣ which prescribes that Article 17(1) GDPR is not applicable when processing is necessary for the freedom of expression and information. For this exception, a balancing exercise has to be conducted between the freedom of expression and the right to data protection. The DPA also referred to the Google Spain case and stated that the rights of privacy and data protection (Article 7 and 8 of the Charter) usually prevail in this balancing test. However, this balancing exercise can in special cases depend on the nature of the specific information and the sensitivity of this information for the privacy of the data subject, as well as the public’s interest in having access to this information, which can vary depending on the role of the data subject in public life. (C-131/12, par 81).

The DPA determined that the sole wish from data subject to be removed from the online archive was not sufficient. Digital archives contain valuable information for which accessibility must be preserved. Archives also contribute to democratic opinion-forming. Any measure preventing access to these archives must be justified with particularly compelling reasons. The DPA also added that the ECHR had stated that there is more room for balancing conflicting interests when the archived information relates to past events than when it relates to current or recent events.

The DPA stated that the photo of the house constituted personal data, because the data subject was the owner of the house, which made him indirectly identifiable. Therefore, the data subject was entitled to use Article 17 GDPR to request removal, if any of the requirements in Article 17 GDPR were applicable. However, the DPA determined that the processing in this case fell under the journalistic exception. The controller could have a legitimate interest for the processing of this information. In general, erasure request were also thoroughly reviewed by the controller using journalistic ethical rules, especially regarding the truthfulness of the information and confidentiality of used sources.

The data subject's position was that the lockdown party did not take place in his building, but he did not provide any evidence. The controller stated that this was incorrect, after checking this fact with the responsible journalist internally. The DPA determined that the positions of both parties were opposites. Without decisive evidence, a balancing act pursuant to Article 17(3)(a) GDPR was deemed impossible.

The DPA continued by stating that at first glance, the complaint was not precise enough and provided too little evidence to enable the DPA to make a decision without starting an investigation. The DPA determined that it was not expedient to enlist the help of its investigation service. An investigation would not be proportionate, looking at the resources necessary to make the investigation a success. Also, at first glance, the DPA determined that it would not be able to gather evidence in this case, unless it would interview the journalist and ask him to reveal his sources. This kind of investigation is normally not a priority for the DPA.

The DPA suggested the option to data subject that he could select a more appropriate legal remedy.",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 89"
"On 27 April 2021, Landsbankinn hf., a bank and the alleged controller, received an access request from the complainant, the data subject, regarding personal data which the bank may have. More specifically, the data subject requested access to the email communication of the bank's employees that had him as a subject. The communication took place through office email addresses but did not concern the bank's operations.

The bank provided the data subject with a copy of all the personal information processed in the bank's activities. However, it rejected the request to the extent that it concerned the e-mail communication of its employees, stating that another controller is concerned, namely, a workers' union. The data subject is a former member of the union and, in the bank's opinion, the data subject's request for access to the emails of employees of the bank, related to their confidential duties for the union, is not made in good faith. The bank speculated that the complainant is trying to access personal information from the activities of a third party through the bank.

The data subject responded that the bank's arguments for refusing his access request do not stand up to scrutiny. The data request is directed to the bank because it is known that the bank's email address was used for the processing and distribution of information about the data subject and, therefore, the request is rightly directed to it. In the opinion of the data subject, it is unreasonable that he was advised to contact an unrelated non-governmental organization in order to gain access to data stored in a mailbox operated by the bank.","The Icelandic DPA held that the bank was not the controller for the purposes of the email communication requested by the data subject.

According to Article 4(7) GDPR, ""controller"" refers to an individual, legal entity, government or other entity that alone or in cooperation with others determines the purposes and methods of processing personal data.

In the data subject's right of access request to the bank, two of its employees are listed, who are also board members of a workers' union. The data subject requested a copy of their e-mail communications with third parties concerning the him. It is clear from the documents of the case that the aforementioned e-mail communications which discussed the data subject concerned the work of the persons in question for the union.

The DPA held that similar considerations apply to the e-mail communications in question as apply to the handling of employees' private e-mails that are not related to the employer's activities. Taking into account Article 9 of the Icelandic regulations no. 837/2006 on electronic monitoring and handling of personal information generated during electronic monitoring, employers are prohibited to view employees' personal e-mail unless it is absolutely necessary, such as due to a computer virus or a similar technical incident.

Accordingly, the e-mail communication in question is irrelevant to the bank, as they do not concern its operations. The bank cannot assess the data subject's right to access about this data since that assessment falls under the union as the controller of the data.",COMPLIANT,Article 4

The complainant states that the FPS Finance did not communicate to him comparables for the recording of the cadastral income of his property. According to the complainant, he was not informed that such communication is a legal obligation.

FPS Finance maintains its position, as ""comparables"" can be considered personal data and therefore a legal basis is required to process or provide this information to third parties. Specifically, the communication of comparables has its legal basis under  Article 6(1)(f)","The Disputes Chamber proceeds to dismiss the complaint in accordance with article 95 , § 1, 3° WOG, giving three motives underlying its decision as to why it does not wish to pursue the case in question. The Disputes Chamber finds that the complaint does not concern any processing of personal data concerning the complainant or affecting the complainant according to the specific criteria developed by the Disputes Chamber. Furthermore: the Disputes Chamber brings forward the fact that a request for inspection under Article 15 GDPR cannot lead to or be misused for the purpose of disclosing personal data of third parties. To this end, the Disputes Chamber stipulates that it cannot conclude that there has been a breach of the GDPR and data protection regulations.

Moreover, the files brought by the complaint concerns an ancillary dispute with the defendant, concerning the calculation of the cadastral income of a property owned by the complainant, to which the Disputes Chamber concludes that its intervention is not necessary and that the main dispute should be brought before a competent court.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 15"
"An employee (data subject) was unable to work for more than six weeks within a year due to illness, and the employer (controller) was liable for continued pay during absence. The controller invited the data subject to occupational integration management (BEM) by letter. The aim of BEM is to determine the health restrictions that have resulted in absences from work and to find possibilities of reducing them in the future to avoid dismissal. The data subject did not respond to this invitation, and the controller terminated the data subject's employment.

The data subject complained about the correctness of the BEM initiation as they had not received the enclosures named in the invitation letter. The data subject requested that the employment relationship would not be terminated, and the controller was of the opinion that due to the continued payment of wages, it could no longer be reasonably expected to continue the employment.

The court found that termination of employment relationship had not occurred, and the controller was ordered to continue employing the data subject. The controller appealed as they considered the judgment to be in error.","The court found the termination to be socially unjustified under §1(2) KSchG, which underlines steps for determining the social justifiability of dismissal. The balancing of interests was disproportionate as the controller did not initiate the BEM in an appropriate manner.

The court applied Article 9(2)(a) GDPR, according to which the data subject could have voluntarily disclosed their health data defined in Article 4(15) GDPR to the site manager who was not involved in the BET. The court emphasised that in such a case, the data subject should be informed explicitly that the consent is voluntary becuase it is not necessary for implementing the BEM pursuant to Article 7(4) GDPR. However, the site manager was not on the list of members to whom the health data was disclosed. Thus, the data subject could not have known from the invitation letter that the disclosure of his health data to the site management could take place only with additional consent and within the BEM procedure and purpose.

The court concluded that the requirements for proper information about the use of data were not met and that the data subject's employment interest outweighs the interests of the controller.

Also, that installations of this type of device must be accompanied by mandatory informative signs. The DPA held that there is no violation of data minimisation, Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. No fines can be imposed against the controller and Article 83(5) GDPR can therefore not be imposed.

"On 22 January 2022, the complainant disclosed the official e-mail address and the official telephone number of a data subject to the Austrian data protection authority (DPA) via a form made available by the DPA. Subsequently, the complainant filed a complaint against itself in order to clarify by way of an official decision whether a data protection violation could technically occur by sharing personal data with the DPA and whether such a violation had actually occurred in practice.","The DPA noted that Article 77 (1) GDPR grants a data subject the right to lodge a complaint if there is a breach of the processing of personal data relating to him or her and that the European Court of Justice has held that Article 8 (1) and (3) of the Charter of the EU also grants a data subject the right to submit a petition to the national supervisory authorities for the protection of his or her fundamental rights (see judgment ""Schrems I"" of the ECJ of 6 October 2015, para. 58 et seq.).

However, the DPA also stated that one of the necessary preconditions for asserting the right to lodge a complaint is that the person lodging the complaint is personally affected by the processing. Therefore, Article 77(1) enshrines a right that a data subject is entitled to, but not, for example, a controller or processor. In this case, it was clear to the DPA from the complainant's submissions that he was not himself a data subject, but rather that he may have unlawfully disclosed the personal data of another individual - as the actual data subject - and was then lodging a complaint against himself.

"The data subject contacted the Norwegian DPA on 18 December 2020 due to a belief that unlawful entries had been made on her son's welfare record at the Child Welfare Service (the controller).

The Norwegian DPA found no basis for conducting investigations in this area and recommended that the data subject re-direct any questions about municipality controls and routines for handling personal data to the municipality Data Protection Officer (DPO) and closed the case on 29 April 2021. The data subject was granted access to the child welfare records and proceeded to complain one more time to the DPA, asking to reassess the controller's handling of confidential personal data in an e-mail on 7 December 2021.

The DPA held in its assessment that they did not possess the competence to assess who in the controller' office had legitimate access to the child welfare record and who did not. In particlar, the DPA did not have the competence to assess whether employees of the controller had acted in breach of the Child Protection Act. Moreover, the DPA did not have the necessary professional expertise in child protection to assess which employees of the controller had an official responsiility to make entries in the journal. In practice, the DPA had no opportunity to review the controller's own assessment of the legality of the posting. Therefore, the DPA decided not to carry out investigations in this case because it fell outside the scope of the their area of responsibility outlined by Article 57(1)(a) GDPR.

The data subject complained about the closing of the case to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board.","The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board (the Board) assessed the DPA's closure of the case due to lack of competence as a decision on rejection. A decision on rejection gives the right to appeal, according to cf. Section 28 of the Public Administration Act, cf. section 2, third paragraph.

First, the Board recalled that all processing of personal data by a child welfare service must have a valid legal basis in Article 6 GDPR. If the information also includes sensitive data specified in Article 9(1) GDPR, there must be a basis for processing in Article 9(2) GDPR. The Board assumed that the controller had a legal basis for processing children's health data under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR (exercise of official authority) and Article 9(2)(b) GDPR (fulfilling its obligations in the area of social law), to the extent that it was permitted under national law. The tasks and duties of child welfare services are regulated by several national laws. The most central provisions are given in the Child Protection Act and the Public Administration Act. Child welfare services are given an explicit authority to process personal data in the Child Protection Act § 6-7 leter c.

Further, the DPA noted that it is the State Administrator who, in accordance with the Child Protection Act § 2-3 first paragraph letter a, must supervise that the law and the regulations are applied correctly and in a way that promotes the law's purpose. Therefore, the Board agreed with the DPA that it was not the right authority when it comes to assessing which of the controller's employees had legal access to the data subject son's welfare records.

The camera is 1.2km from the gas station, has a range of 60 meters and is installed in the upstairs apartment, which does not belong to the controller, but to his relatives.  The complaint has been denied because it was proven that the camera was directed only towards the access door to the garage. Although it affects the sidewalk, the dimensions are limited to a scope that is considered essential to preserve the persons and property that are in the purpose for which the camera is installed. In addition, the Spanish DPA resolution considered that there were several informative signs, indicating not only that it was a video-monitored area, but also the person responsible for the treatment. Moreover, there was no evidence of any data processing of the data subject, nor was there any control of the access to the house, so that the resolution indicated that the presumption of innocence must prevail in this case.","The Spanish DPA considered that the controller has not exercised a control of the entrances and exits of the property, nor has it processed the personal data of the data subject and/or third parties in violation of the content of art. 5 (1) GDPR, which provides that personal data shall be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. According to the AEPD, since the camera only reached a sidewalk of limited dimensions and containing informative signs, there was no violation of art. 22 (2) of the Spanish local law (LOPDGDD), according to which images of the public road can only be captured to the extent that it is essential for the purpose of preserving people and property.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA alleging a breach of her right to data protection and secrecy by recording and disseminating a phone call conversation without her consent.","First, the Austrian DPA had to determine whether the GDPR was applicable. The DPA checked whether the material scope was met, in particular whether the case fell under the household exception found in Article 2(2)(c) GDPR. According to this provision, the GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data by natural persons to carry out exclusively personal or family activities. The absence of any reference to a professional or economic activity was considered as an important factor.

The DPA held that the concept of ""family"" was not to be interpreted strictly in accordance with family law, but also included other relationships considered as ""family"" by the general public, regardless of marriage and parenthood. In this respect, it was irrelevant whether there was a formal bond or whether personal relationships between the parties existed on a purely informal basis. The DPA noted that Recital 18 GDPR describes the use of social networks and online activities as part of a personal or family activity. In this case, the data subject had a phone call over the private messaging platform, Whatsapp.

Despite extensive investigations, the DPA found no indications that this data processing was in any way connected to a professional or economic activity. The decisive factor was that the data processing was an exclusively private matter within a limited circle of acquaintances.

Further, the DPA decided whether Section 1(1) DSG, the national data protection law, applied but the conclusion was the same as for the GDPR - the material scope was not met.

The DPA concluded that the GDPR was not applicable because of the house exception under Article 2(2)(c) GDPR and dismissed the complaint.",COMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 5"

The data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA stating that the controller did not carry out any checks to validate the change of ownership, allowing the change despite the existence of an outstanding debt on the vehicle. They also alleged that the controller processed their data without a legitimate basis.","The DPA held that there was a legal basis to process the data: the documentation was required under the General Vehicle Regulation for the notification of the sale of the vehicle (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR), and, the entry in the vehicle register was made in the performance of a contract to which the data subject was a party (Article (6)(1)(b) GDPR).

Moreover, Google LLC argued that the press coverage was still considered to serve the public interest since it was published a short time ago.

Although the exact circumstances are not further elaborated in the decision, the DPA acknowledge that the data subject had a role in public life.","The DPA first held that the controller processed the data legally on the basis of legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 GDPR. Although the data subject had an interest in the protection of their personal data, Google LLC's financial interests and the interest of the public to access information on the Internet outweighed it.

Moreover, in its second analysis, the DPA also held that the data subject could no rely on their right to be forgotten according to Article 17 GDPR to remove the search results in the Google search engine. The DPA noted that, according to Article 17(3)(a) GDPR, the right to be forgotten may not apply to the extent that it conflicts with exercising the right of freedom of expression and information. In the case at hand, it was of particular significance that the concerned data subject held a public role. The DPA elaborated that public figures may enjoy a lesser degree of privacy protection than private persons due to the importance of being able to freely discuss issues that may be relevant to the public. Moreover, the DPA considered that the press coverage was only about the data subject's job and the conditions at their workplace but not about their personal conduct in private life.

The data subject argued that a third party had acquired access to personal data, such as text messages that could have been received at the phone number after it was reassigned. Additionally, the third-party would have been capable of accessing personal data of the data subjects on websites and smart apps that use the phone number as an identifier.

The controller argued to the contrary that no security breach occurred.  The incident was caused by a human error on the part of the relevant employee who handed over the phone number to an unauthorized party. No information about previous calls, text messages or other information was made available when the phone number was transferred. The controller also does not see itself responsible for other personal data that may be connected to the data subject's phone number, such as the use of authentication methods in services unrelated to the controller. Furthermore, the controller believed that its current processes minimize the risk of mistakes like this occurring and pointed out that incidents like this have only occurred three times since 2015. The controller therefore assessed that its technical and organizational measures are in accordance with the security standards required by Article 32 GDPR.","The DPA made two holdings: First, it held that the controller did not ensure an appropriate security of the data subject's personal data pursuant to Article 32 GDPR. Second, it also held that the controller did not appropriately notify the security breach as required by Article 33(1) and Article 34(1) GDPR.

Regarding its first decision, the DPA pointed out that a phone number in itself constituted personal data according to Article 4(1) GDPR. Moreover, it noted that all processing of personal data has to comply with Article 6 GDPR and the principles of Article 5(1) GDPR, which also included the obligation to uphold appropriate security standards (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR). Additionally, Article 32 GDPR requires that controllers shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing personal data.

The DPA considered it clear that a weakness in the controller's security system led to the third party gaining access to the data subject's phone number. The third party was therefore able to access additional personal information about the complainant, i.e. they could access the data subject's personal data on websites and smart applications that use a phone number as an identifier. The DPA considered it irrelevant whether such an access had occurred in practice. Rather, it pointed out that it is likely that the nature of the information that could be accessed in such smart applications and websites may be extensive and may even contain sensitive personal information within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR, including information on the data subject's sexuality. The DPA held there was a significant risk from such an access. therefore, the controller had a special duty to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent the accidental reassignment of already used phone numbers. Consequently, the DPA held that the controller breached Article 32 GDPR.

Concerning its second holding, the DPA pointed out that the incident involved a lack of security within the meaning of Article 4(12) GDPR. In such cases, Article 33(1) GDPR and Article 34(1) GDPR require controllers to, respectively, notify the competent supervisory authority as well as the affected data subject. The DPA elaborated that in establishing whether there is a notification obligation, it must be considered, among other things, that the security breach notifications are intended to give the affected data subjects the opportunity to take the necessary precautions in order to reduce the risk of damage that may result from a security breach.

However, as was clear from the facts of the case, the controller did not report the security breach as it did not believe it was obligated to do so. With reference to what has already been discussed, the DPA considered it clear that it and the data subject should have been notified of the security breach in accordance with the GDPR provisions. It was clear to the DPA that such notifications should have taken place and that the controller had thereby breached the GDPR.

As a consequence of its two holding, the DPA ordered the controller, pursuant to the powers awarded to it by Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, to introduce measures concerning its distribution of phone numbers which would create an appropriate level of security.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 32"
"There was a dispute as to whether a controller, a school administrator, was allowed to refer to the results of a teaching evaluation concerning the data subject's teaching at a meeting, in which other school staff was present.

The data subject argued that the controller had breached the GDPR when it shared information about the results of the teaching evaluation without consent. Such teaching evaluations were highly confidential and only the controller and the relevant teacher should have received a copy and discussed the results of the evaluation.

The controller replied that the data subject was invited to the meeting for the purpose of discussing complaints of a parent regarding the data subject's behavior and assessment towards the students. No unauthorized parties had attended the meeting and all participants were bound by the statutory duty of confidentiality of government officials or employees regarding what was discussed. The controller also referred to the fact that the case only concerned the verbal communication of personal data, which was based on memory at the time. Therefore, it would not constitute ""processing"" of personal data in the sense of the GDPR.

The controller further elaborated that teaching evaluation is an important part of the school's dashboard on teacher performance and necessary for quality management. The purpose of it is, among other things, to achieve the goals laid down in Icelandic law on secondary schools, to ensure that the school's activities are in accordance with the applicable regulations, the main curriculum and to increase the quality of learning and school work and to ensure that students' rights are respected and that they receive the services they are entitled to.","The DPA first assessed whether the case fell within the scope of the GDPR. It mentioned that according to Article 4(2) GDPR ""processing"" means "" means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means. The DPA concluded that the oral transmission of personal information, on its own, generally does not fall under the scope of the law. However, it also noted that, in the present case, the information discussed during the meeting must have originated from a digital or recorded form (i.e., the teaching evaluation). From this fact alone, the DPA concluded that processing must have taken place and that the case, consequently, fell within the scope of the GDPR.

Secondly, the DPA analysed whether the personal data was lawfully processed. The DPA described that lawful processing must be based on a legal basis of Article 6 GDPR and follow the principles of Article 5 GDPR. The DPA noted that based on the legal obligations of the controller in its duty to operating a secondary school, it is necessary to process personal data for the day-to-day operation of the secondary school. This also includes including that task to provide specific employees with information about the results of teacher evaluations. Consequently, the processing was lawful based on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. Moreover, the DPA was also of the opinion that the controller did not share personal data of the data subject with unauthorized parties. Therefore, the complaint was rejected.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The controller was a company based in the United States without an establishment in the European Union (EU). This controller offered an extension for computer browsers, which allowed users of this extension to obtain and verify professional contact details (telephone number and e-mail address) of a data subject who had a profile on LinkedIn or Salesforce.com. Users of the extension had to navigate to the profile of the data subject in order to get the contact data. The controller stated that the purpose of this extension was to prevent online fraud. Besides retrieving the contact information, the extension checked whether the profiles belonged to real people and whether these people actually practised the profession described in their profiles. For this purpose, the controller used its own database with professional contact data to double check if the results produced by the extension matched with contact data in this database.

The controller had collected the data for this database from its three smartphone applications that it also offered. When users installed any of these apps on their smartphone, the controller was able to collect the contacts saved on the smartphone for its database. The controller stated that it had mechanisms in place to only collect and store 'professional' contact data and to filter out contact data of a personal nature.

The French DPA (DPA) started an investigation into the controller. It also later received two complaints regarding the controller, received on 22 October 2018 and 14 February 2019.","The DPA started by clarifying that the data subjects in this decision were the people whose profiles were visited by users of the controller’s extension. The DPA also stated that the ‘professional’ nature of the data stored by the controller did not take away the personal nature of this personal data (CJEU, 9 November 2010, Volker and Others, Case C-92/09 and C-93/09, pt. 59). The DPA confirmed that the controller was processing personal data and was responsible for the processing operations regarding the browser extension and the smartphone applications.

Despite the fact that the DPA acknowledged that the controller was processing personal data of data subjects in France, it determined that the GDPR was not applicable. The controller did not have an establishment in the EU (Article 3(1) GDPR) and the controller did not offer services to data subjects in the EU (Article 3(2)(a) GDPR).

The DPA concluded that Article 3(2)(b) GDPR was also not applicable. The DPA mentioned that the online collection or analysis of personal data of data subjects in the EU was not enough to automatically be considered 'monitoring'. It was necessary to take into account the purpose for which the data was processed by the controller and, in particular, if there were any subsequent behavioural analysis or profiling techniques conducted by the controller. According to the DPA, the monitoring of data subjects on the internet, including the potential further use of profiling techniques (Article 4(4) GDPR) was an important factor for determining whether data subject's behaviour was monitored (Recital 24 and Guidelines 3/2018).

The DPA concluded that it was not established that the behaviour of data subjects was monitored by the controller. According to the DPA, the creation of a database with professional contact data (telephone and e-mail address), for the purpose of the identification of data subjects on LinkedIn and Salesforce.com, was not a form of processing that consisted of analysing or predicting a person's behaviour. The controller also did not use personal data processing techniques that consisted in profiling of data subjects.

The DPA concluded that the GDPR was not applicable and that the DPA was therefore not able to impose a penalty.

"On 11 May 2019, the data subject bought an unspecified item from the company Asus on EBay, an online market place. Asus is a company that mainly sells consumer electronics, such as smartphones, laptops and accessories.

On 3 February 2020, the data subject received an e-mail from noreply.invitation@trustpilot.com. In this email, the data subject was asked to evaluate his buying experience with Asus. On 4 February 2020, the data subject requested access to his personal data by sending an e-mail to Trustpilot using a different e-mail account. Trustpilot replied on 6 February 2020 that it was not able to identify the data subject using this e-mail address. On 8 February 2020, Trustpilot sent the data subject another similar e-mail to the data subject.

On 10 February 2020, the data subject filed a complaint at a German DPA (Bavaria DPA), which forwarded the complaint to another German DPA (Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit (Berlin DPA). The latter transferred the complaint to the Danish DPA (DPA), which was the lead supervisory authority in this decision (Article 56 GDPR).

According to the data subject, Trustpilot was not allowed to process personal data about him. He also stated that Trustpilot had not responded to his access request. Trustpilot stated that it was a processor for other companies in relation to the sending of such emails. Trustpilot based this assessment on the fact that companies decided to use Trustpilots software and also decided whether and when invitations were send out using Trustpilots software. In addition, it were the companies, in this case, Asus, that provided the personal data used for the invitations. Therefore, Trustpilot was the processor.

In this decision, a data processing agreement of Trustpilot was also disclosed. It was stated that Trustpilot would assist in any handling of requests from data subjects under Chapter III of the GDPR and, where commercially practicable, under any other Applicable Data Protection Law. This could include requests for access, rectification, blocking or deletion, which related to Trustpilots processing of relevant data.","The main issue of this decision is whether Trustpilot was the controller or processor. The DPA stated that it assumed, based on the information available in the case file, that Trustpilot acted as a processor for Asus when it was processing personal data by sending an e-mail on behalf of Asus. Therefore, it was not the responsibility of the processor to handle and respond to access requests pursuant of Article 12 and 15 GDPR.

However, the DPA stated that it was regrettable that the processor did not have a consistent practice to search for relevant information, such as the name and address of the data subject who submitted the access request. If this had been the case, the processor could have been able to identify the data subject and thus, in its role as processor, could have assisted the controller to the extent as agreed in the data processing agreement.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 28, Article 60"
"The controller maintained the website ""Íslendingabók"". The website was a database containing genealogical information about the inhabitants of Iceland, dating back more than 1,200 years. A data subject sent a request for deletion of her and her minor child's personal data to the controller. The controller rejected the request, prompting the data subject to complain to the Icelandic DPA. The data subject asked the DPA to decide that the controller was not allowed to register, save, process, publish, and share personal information about her and her child in any possible way.

The data subject argued that she did not give her consent for personal information about her and her minor child to be recorded and published in the Íslendingabók. In addition,she was not informed about that in advance.

The controller, on the other hand, responded that since the database concerned genealogical research, which is a type of scientific and historical research, its data processing could be conducted under the legal basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. The controller also argued that it had a legitimate interest in processing the personal data which overrode the interests of the data subjects to have their data deleted. The controller pointed out that they promote genealogical research in Iceland by running the database: ""Genealogical research, which has been carried out in Iceland for centuries, is very popular with the public and is one of the main pillars of the nation's cultural heritage. In addition, genealogical research is one basis and prerequisite for extensive research in the field of human genetics in this country.""

In its rejection of the data subject's erasure request, the controller relied on Article 17(3)(d) GDPR. The provision allows controllers to reject erasure requests if the personal data concerned is processed for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, historical research or statistical purposes","The Icelandic DPA rejected the complaint.

The DPA held that processing for the benefit of the field of genealogy may rely on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. It noted that the provision stated that personal data may be processed if it is necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, that require the protection of personal data, outweigh the other interests. In its decision to declare that the interests and fundamental rights of the data subjects are not outweighing the legitimate interests of the controller, the DPA relied on one of its former decisions (case no. 2004/568), which came to the conclusion that the publication of general demographic information (such as name, social security number, names of descendants, parents and current spouses) in genealogical and biographical publications is hardly avoidable.

As regards to the right to erasure of data subjects granted by Article 17(1) GDPR, the DPA noted that Article 17(3) GDPR provides an exception to the right. Namely, as already stated by the controller, when the continued processing is necessary for archiving in the public interest, research in the field of science or history, or for statistical purposes. The DPA held that the exception applies in the concerned case. In its reasoning, it solely referred to its decision on the same issue in the case no. 2021020473 which was published on January 25, 2022.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17"

The parent attached a court form confirming the right to access information about the data subject. Although not clear from the decision itself, it seems that the controller refused to comply with the rectification and deletion request. Subsequently, the parent filed a complaint with the Finnish DPA.

During the course of the opened proceedings, the DPA contacted the controller but did not request more information from the parent.","The Finnish DPA recalled that Article 16 GDPR provides for the data subject's right to have incorrect data rectified while Article 17 GDPR grants the data subject the right to have incorrect data deleted.

The DPA referred only to national law when establishing who has the right to exercise data subject rights on behalf of a minor child. In this regard, the DPA noted that Section 4 Subsection 4 of the Child Custody Act stipulates that, as a general rule, the legal guardian represents the child in a matter concerning that person. However, according to Chapter 2, Section 9, Subsection 1, Clause 3 of the Child Welfare Act, the court can decide that a parent who is not the legal guardian, has the same right to receive confidential information about the child from authorities and private service providers.

In this case, the DPA held that data subject rights under Articles 15-22 GDPR can only be exercised on behalf of the minor child by their legal guardian. The DPA noted that, although the parent had a court form confirming the right to access the data subject's personal data, this right did not extend to the right to request rectification or deletion of said personal data.

"Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (the controller) allegedly used facial recognition programmes to confirm the identity of students (data subjects) taking online exams during the Covid-19 pandemic. The controller used an IT tool from Smowl Tech (the processor) which had to be installed on the data subjects' devices. This app used the front camera to register the data subject's face while taking the exam, but it also captured the computer’s desktop. An additional camera had ot be installed on the students’ devices, as a mandatory condition to sit an exam. The second camera captured the data subject's work environment, focusing on their hands, body and work screens. A failure to install and use these cameras would result in failing the exam.

A Students’ Association, 11 individuals and several other associations submitted complaints to the Spanish DPA against the controller's prcoessing activities. The complaints regarding the second camera sustained that it was disproportionate since it could also capture third parties. Regarding the software, the consent required was not valid because students who had a high-risk profile for Covid-19 did not have a choice. Others argued that the controller did not have a legitimate interest in obliging data subjects to install a software on their devices where they keep their agendas, bank apps, private communications, keywords, etc.

The controller claimed that none of the cameras used facial recognition techniques (which was supported with an attestation of the processor as evidence). Thus, consent was not mandatory as a legal basis but ‘necessity for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest conferred by the national law of Universities (Ley Orgánica de Universidades). The controller denied that any software was installed for the use of the second camera on the data subject's devices. Furthermore, the software installed for the frontal camera did not access data subjects' personal information unless they showed the data on their screen when the desktop was recorded. However, the controller provided data subjects with the information that screenshots taken by the tool were taken if the data subject accessed a tab not compatible with the exam. These screenshots were evaluated by the controller and deleted in case that no fraud was found. The controller also applied a variety of technical and organisational measures: a proportionality test, assessment of the security provided by the processor, implementation of the principles of privacy by design and default, risk assessments, and DPIAs.","Firstly, the Spanish DPA recalled that facial recognition systems use biometric data, which constitutes sensitive personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR. However, the DPA held that, in the present case, no sensitive data had been processed by the controller. The DPA accepted as evidence the certificate signed by the processor, confirming that the controller did not process biometric data. Furthermore, the DPA stated that it was important to differentiate between the collection of desktop screenshots or their review by professional staff and the use of facial recognition techniques which use biometric software to verify the identity of a person. The DPA agreed that the legal basis for verification of identity during exams was not consent but rather the processing was necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(e) GDPR), in this case university education.

Secondly, the DPA confirmed that the software installed for the use of the front camera and the desktop does did not access data subject's personal data unless the data subject's manifestly showed it during an exam.

Thirdly, the DPA also confirmed that there was no installation of software for the activation of the second camera. Rather, access to this camera by the controller happened through an URL which requested permission from the data subject first.

Additionally, the desktop screenshots were reviewed manually by the university staff, thus, with no automated decision-making involved. Furthermore, the risk assessment performed by the controller showed that the use of the second camera did not increase the risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms and there was no other effective measure to achieve the same purpose. Finally, the DPA considered that the information provided to data subjects was complete and in accordance with the transparency principle of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

"On 20 May 2021, a Spanish natural person (the data subject), filed a complaint to the AEPD because of the video surveillance system installed by its neighbour (the controller). The surveillance system of the controller entailed a set of four cameras that, according to the data subject, covered part of the public road and went beyond what could be considered adequate for the surveillance of the property. Accordingly, this would constitute a breach of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.","First, the AEPD recalled that, in accordance with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, private surveillance cameras should be oriented towards private space, and not intimidate adjacent neighbours nor control the local transit without justification. Unless permitted by specific legal provisions, private individuals are not allowed to capture images of public space. In the case at hand, the AEPD found that the cameras used by the controller aimed at recording the controller’s property, within the limits of the legal data protection provisions. In its analysis, the AEPD held that the first camera used by the controller also captured the surroundings, which was done in proportionate manner and thus was not illegal. The second and third cameras captured a very small portion of the community yard. Finally, the fourth camera located on the controller’s rooftop did not capture direct images of the data subject’s property. The AEPD concluded that the images captured by the surveillance system were not disproportionate or excessive, and did not constitute of a breach of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

Second, the AEPD recalled that, compliant with Article 13(1) and (2) GDPR, and Article 22(4) of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (Ley Orgánica 3/2018 de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales - LOPDGDD), the data controller should display a sufficient visible sign informing data subjects about the video surveillance of the area.

"Background

About a month after the ""Schrems II ruling"" by the CJEU (CJEU - C-311/18 - Schrems II) the NGO noyb filed 101 complaints regarding data transfers from EEA based websites to Google LLC and Facebook Inc. in the U.S (see here and here). In order to coordinate the work of all involved DPAs, the EDPB created a special task force.

Complaint

On 18.08.2020, a data subject (represented by noyb) filed a complaint with the DSB against both the website provider (in its role as data exporter) and Google LLC (in its role as data importer), arguing that both respondents violated Articles 44 et. seqq. GDPR in light of the ""Schrems II"" ruling by transferring their personal data to Google LLC. As Google LLC qualifies as ""electronic communication service provider"" under 50 U.S. Code § 1881(b)(4), it is subject to surveillance by U.S. intelligence services and can be ordered to disclose data of European citizens - such as the data subject - to them.

The complaint was filed against the Spanish Royal Academy (Real Academia Española, ""RAE"").

The controller alleged that it is a public law institution that uses Google Analytics tools solely and exclusively for fulfilling the general interest purposes that constitute its ultimate goal, which is to ensure the development, dissemination, proper use and update of the Spanish language; in order to achieve that, it is necessary to have access to statistical data related to the access and use of these instruments, and also to know its evolution and adaptation to the reality of the use of the language at any given moment (e.g. statistics related to the use of terms not included in the dictionary can allow a better knowledge of the evolution in the use of the language and the possible inclusion of such terms in the future).

Through the use of Google Analytics, the controller can know essential information related to the use of the language and its diffusion worldwide.

The controller also alleged that it only had access to aggregated data that did not allow for identification of users. The controller had no access to personal data whatsoever, nor IPs or any other information. Hence, no personal data was processed.

The controller also indicated that it had subscribed a contract with Google LLC (Conditions for the Processing of Data) and that therefore the RAE was a controller while Google was a processor.

Furthermore, the controller alleged that it had only used the most basic functionalities of Google Analytics, guaranteeing the minimization of the use of data, so only aggregated data was processed.

Only the following data was gathered:

1. Identification of the geographic area (city and country) from which the user of the user accessed the website and statistics by country.  
2. Language.  
3. Source from which the visit originates.  
4. Statistical flow of visits to the Web Site.  
5. Statistical analysis of visits, offering percentages of recurrent or first access visits.  
6. Browser used for access.  
7. Type of mobile device used.  
8. Screen resolution of the device and its operating system. 

Nor Google Signals nor Comparatives were activated.

On 08.09.2020, the AEPD verified that the code of the website included the creation and storage of Google Analytics cookies.

On 27.10.2021, the AEPD confirmed that such code was not on the website anymore.","The AEPD decided to accept the allegations of the controller and considered that the controller had not violated Article 45 GDPR nor any of the subsequent Articles from Chapter V of the GDPR. The AEPD took into account that the controller had stopped using Google Analytics short after the Schrems II ruling and that it had never used the obtained information to identify specific users.

Therefore, the DPA concluded that, at the time of issuing the decision, the controller was not in breach of the GDPR under the competential scope of the AEPD.",COMPLIANT,"Article 45, Article 46"
"The data subject is a computer gamer. The controller Reto Moto ApS, a Danish game developer.

During the game experience, the data subject displayed an undesirable behaviour and was accused of breaking the game's code of conduct. In other words, according to the controller, the data subject was suspected of cheating. It is not clear from the decision if the data subject was banned from the game.

On 30 May 2019, the data subject filed an access request at the controller pursuant to Article 15 GDPR. It is not clear from the decision what the data subject specifically requested. In its response, on 26 June 2019, the controller clarified that data about game replay, anti-cheat related information, server logs and in-game chat messages would not be disclosed to the data subject. On 28 June 2019, the data subject informed the controller that the reply was incomplete in his opinion. According to the data subject, anti-cheat information was usually really private information, since anti-cheat software usually contains techniques that are used to get an exceptional level of access to a computer. The data subject had no control over the software once it was installed. The data subject was also of the opinion this anti-cheat information contained personal data, and was therefore subject to the GDPR. On 26 June 2019, the controller confirmed that it had answered to the access request. The controller also confirmed that it did not provide the Game replay data, Server logs, anti-cheat information and In-game chat messages.

The controller stated that it did not provide a copy of the game replay data and the server logs because the controller had deleted these before receiving the data subject's access request.

The controller also explained that it did not provide access to the anti-cheat information, because this could harm the controller and other players. This information, it was argued, constituted a technical log with data explaining why the data subject should be excluded from the game because of supposed cheating. The controller also stated that these logs included very few personal data. According to the controller, the data subject had been provided with the reason for his exclusion and was also made aware of the time of the cheating, which was in violation with the game terms of service. The technical log also included information about the software used by the data subject to cheat. The controller meant that this did not constitute personal data and was also of the opinion that this information was strictly confidential, since disclosing this information might reveal how players could cheat in the game, which would harm the controller itself and other players of the game.

With regard to the in-game messages, the controller explained it's reasoning for not including in-game chat messages in the copy. The controller explained that it could not remove personal data of other data subjects in these chats, since these messages contained several different languages that the controller did not understand. According to the controller, these chat messages were also written in jargon, which made it even harder for the controller to understand the proper context of the messages. Due to these factors, the controller stated that it could not guarantee that a copy of in-game messages would not result in the disclosure of personal data of other players. For this reason, the controller was of the opinion that the protection of rights and freedoms of other players outweighed the interest of the data subject in receiving access to personal data.

On 17 July 2019,  the data subject filed a complaint about the controller's answer at the DPA. The DPA continued to review the case.","First, the DPA reprimanded the controller for not providing a copy of in-game chat messages sent directly to - and by the data subject in accordance with Article 15(3) GDPR. Although this is not explicitly mentioned in the decision, it is reasonable to conclude that these are private messages between the data subject and other players. There was no legal basis which the controller could have used to deny the data subject this information. The DPA also emphasised that the data subject would already have knowledge about the content of these messages.

Second, the DPA found that the controller was entitled to deny a copy of other in-game chat messages, pursuant to Article 15(4) GDPR. Despite the fact that this was also not specified in the decision itself, it is reasonable to assume that the controller was allowed to deny group messages in the copy under Article 15(4) GDPR. The DPA considered the fact that chats were conducted in different languages and sometimes contained jargon. It could therefore not be ruled out that the controller would disclose information about other data subjects. In addition, other players of the game should be able to rely on a certain degree of confidentiality with regard to messages sent ""in the heat of the moment"".

Third, the DPA also determined that the controller was entitled to deny a copy of any personal information in relation to anti-cheat measures, pursuant to cf. section 22(1) of the Danish Data Protection Act (DDPA). This provision stated that Article 15 GDPR did not apply if the data subject’s interest in this information was overridden by essential considerations of private interests. The DPA emphasised that this anti-cheat information could reveal how players could cheat the game and its underlying logic, which would harm the controller and other players. The data subject’s interest in obtaining this information was overridden by the controller's interest in not disclosing information how it identified cheating.

Lastly, with regard to the server logs and replay data, the DPA did not find any reason to doubt the controller, which stated that it had deleted this information before receiving the access request from the data subject.",COMPLIANT,Article 15
"The controller is the Icelandic Office of the National Medical Examiner. The controller was established by national law and supervised health services and health workers and dealt with complaints from the public regarding health services. The data subject was the head of a medical department. At an unspecified time, ""association X"", a non-profit organisation representing the interests of patients, sent a message to the controller which criticised the management of the data subject's department and made suggestions to its improvement. Considering the suggestions, the controller started an official investigation case.

According the Icelandic administrative law, the complainant is a party to the investigation. Further, based on law no.  37/1993 on ""The Right to Information and the Duty to Provide Guidance"", the parties to a case enjoy the right to be informed about it. Therefore, after the association sent multiple inquiries, the controller shared personal information about the data subject (the head of the department) in a letter which included, among other things, information that the data subject had been placed on indefinite leave and another person had taken over his job.

Subsequently, the data subject issued a complaint the Icelandic DPA and argued that the controller had no legal basis for the processing. The data subject believed that the comments of the controller in the letter, regarding his indefinite leave, were presented as if they were specific sanctions due to what was stated in the criticism of association X. Moreover, the data subject believed that the association X was not a party in the investigation case and, thus, disclosure of such information could not have been possibly based on a law. (The data subject's arguments, as presented by the decision, do not go further in depth. However, it can be presumed that the data subject is, in effect, arguing the following: First, if the processing of the personal data can not be based on a law, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR cannot be used as a legal basis. Second, there is no apparent legitimate interest present for the processing which would overwrite the data subject's interests in the personal data not being disclosed, as would have been required for Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Therefore, there had been no legal basis for the processing which made it unlawful.)

Conversely, the controller responded that it had been legally obliged to share the personal information in the letter in question after repeated inquiries by the association X about the status of the investigation.","The DPA rejected the complaint and held that the controller had processed the personal data in line with its legal duties and thereby had observed all principles of the GDPR.

First, it noted that all processing had to be based on Article 6(1) GDPR. In the case at hand, processing would, mostly likely, be based on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, which stipulates that personal data may be processed if it is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation that rests on the controller. According to national law, the main role of the controller was, among other things, to supervise health services and health workers and to deal with complaints from the public. Moreover, the controller was authorized to process personal information to fulfil statutory duties according to the law.

Second, the DPA assessed whether association X was entitled to information concerning the investigation case. The data subject argued that since association X did not act on behalf of specific patients, it could not have been involved in the investigation. On the other hand, based on the arguments of the controller, association X acted on behalf of all its members and, therefore, was an interested party to the case. The DPA pointed out that participation to an administrative case, such as the concerned investigation, depend on having a direct, unique, significant, and legally protected interest in the resolution of the case. Moreover, although non-profit organisation may act on behalf of parties in an administrative case, it is also recognized that they can be a party to proceedings for the sake of their members if a significant part of the members have a unique and significant interest in the resolution of a case and if the interest is a declared purpose of the organization. The DPA considered that the association was a party due to the latter conditions being fulfilled. Therefore, the association had a right to access documents and other data related to the investigation. The concerned letter sent by the Office to the investigation intended to summarize the existing case file. Consequently, the processing was legal pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) as it was necessary for the controller to fulfil its legal duties.

Third, the DPA had to assess whether the controller complied with the principles set out in Article 5(1) GDPR, such as lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. The personal data must have been processed in a sufficient and appropriate manner in a way which would not go beyond what was necessary based on the purpose of the processing. The DPA held that the controller had complied with these principles. As the subject matter of the investigation concerned the management of the department, of which the data subject was the head of, the controller could hardly redact all information concerning him. Moreover, the personal data included in the letter was materially limited and directly concerned the measures that had been taken in connection with the criticism of association X. Therefore, the DPA decided that the controller had complied with all principles of Article 5(1) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The controller was a secondary school. The data subject had been a teacher at the school.

In November 2018, the data subject requested a meeting with her fellow teachers to discuss the case of another teacher (teacher C) who, according to her, had been bullied for years. The data subject defended teacher C and, among other things, requested that a psychologist was brought in to assess the situation. According to the school administrator, the data subject had been insulting and shown a lack of respect for her colleagues in view of the sensitive topic of discussion during the meeting. Following the incident, the administrator received emails from the data subject's fellow teachers concerning the improper behaviour of the data subject.

In February 2019, the controller was informed by the Ministry of Education about a complaint by the data subject, in which she argued that she had suffered mental abuse in the  November 2018 meeting.

The same year, the school was required to rearrange its employment structure in the course of which the data subject and teacher C were dismissed.  In November 2019, the school received a letter from the Parliamentary Ombudsman, requesting the school's opinion regarding the joint complaint of the data subject and teacher C, who argued that their dismissals had been illegal.

In 2021, the data subject sent a complaint to the Icelandic DPA. She argued that after she had sent her complaint to the Ministry, the school administer started collecting her personal data through her former colleagues and shared it with the Ministry. Both happened without her consent (see Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) and without informing her of the existence of the data (see Article 14 GDPR). The illegally processed personal data would be used against her in the proceedings in front of the Ministry and the Ombudsman.

The administer of the school denied having actively collected information about the data subject from other teachers. The existing information was sent by other teachers to the administrator as a reaction to the data subject's behaviour in the 2018 meeting. All emails containing personal data, to which the data subject's complain related, were dated between January and February 1, 2019. However, the Ministry did not inform the controller about the complaint procedure until February 11, 2019. The controller also argued that the personal data was created due to the administrator's work activities and was therefore not obtained from a third party. As a result, Articles 13 and 14 GDPR would not apply and the controller would be absolved of its information obligation to the data subject.","The DPA rejected the data subject's complaint.

First, it assessed based on what legal basis the school administer had processed the personal data. It noted that Article 6(1)(c) GDPR allows the processing of personal data if it is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation. Based on a national law, it was the role of the school administrator to manage the day-to-day operation and work of the school. Moreover, the DPA considered that to receive e-mails and messages from their subordinates, including regarding their well-being at work and communication with other staff, regardless of who initiates such disclosure, falls within the work cycle of a school administrator. Therefore, the DPA held that the controller had processed the personal data on a valid legal basis.

Second, the DPA considered whether the controller upheld the Article 5(1) GDPR principles ""fairness and transparency"" and whether the data subject was adequately informed pursuant to Article 14 GDPR. The DPA argued that if processing of personal data was based on the nature of the working relationship between the supervisor and subordinates, as outlined above, the personal data would not be considered to be obtained from a third party. However, Article 14 GDPR would only apply if personal data had been collected from a third party. Consequently, the information obligations of controllers pursuant to Article 14 GDPR would not have to be upheld in order to meet Article 5(1) GDPR's requirements for fairness and transparency.

Lastly, the DPA held that the controller was also under a legal obligation to share the concerned personal data with the Minister of Education and Culture, as the school falls under the supervision of the Minister. Consequently, there was a legal obligation to hand over documents after a relevant request. Here as well, the personal data was processed lawfully pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 14"
"The controller in this case was a department of the King's office that deals with social affairs. A data subject had a dispute with a public authority, more precisely, the Government of the German-speaking Community (hereafter, the ""Government"") which had only partially responded to his request for information. The data subject wrote several complaint letters to the King. These letters contained personal data: his surname, first name and address. In an attempt to solve the matter, the King's office (controller) that had received these letters transferred them to the Government.

The data subject became aware of such disclosure and subsequently submitted an access request with the controller in accordance with Article 15 GDPR. Among the other things, he specifically inquired about the transfer of his data to the Government. The controller did not respond to his requests. The data subject also doubted the overall lawfulness of the processing. In particular, he argued that the transfer of his data was not necessary, since the controller could have simply interceded with the Government to remind it to respond to the requests for information.

He therefore filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA. During the investigation, the controller argued that the King's Office and its services benefit from the immunity from jurisdiction granted to the King under Article 88 of the Belgian Constitution.","Lawfulness

The DPA examined the existence of a legal basis on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, which requires that the processing operation is carried out in the public interest and that it is necessary for the performance of that task.

On the subject of the public task, the DPA referred to a report which states that the King has a duty to form an opinion on the case brought to his attention. The controller was part of the King's services and was responsible for the task of dealing with requests for social assistance addressed to the King. Since the data subject sent his request to the King, he must have been aware of the King's possibility to intervene in citizens' requests, the DPA argued.

Regarding the necessity criteria, the DPA recalled that Article 6(3) requires that the purposes of the processing must be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest. Referring to the case law of the CJEU, the DPA also recalled that if there are realistic and less intrusive alternatives, the processing is not ""necessary"". In this case, the DPA considered that the personal data contained in the letter that the controller transferred were related to the explanation of the dispute and that it was not realistic or effective to pseudonymise them. In response to the data subject's view that the controller could have contacted the Government without transferring his data, the DPA considered that this was in contradiction with its aim of effective intervention. It therefore considered that the processing was necessary to resolve the conflict between the data subject and the Government.

On lawfulness, the DPA therefore concluded that there was no breach of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1).

Rights of the data subject

The DPA recalled that compliance with transparency and information provisions is a precondition for the data subjects to exercise their rights. Noting that a privacy policy was available, the DPA explained that this policy only applied to the personal data of visitors of the website, not to the personal data of data subjects who have sent requests for assistance to the King. By not providing information about the processing of the data in the context of requests for help, the controller breached Articles 12 and 13.

As regards the request for access under Article 15, the DPA did not, however, consider this article as violated. It explained that the data subject's request was for the controller to acknowledge his failures to comply with the GDPR and was therefore not valid.

Immunity from jurisdiction

After noting that the controller failed to comply with Articles 12 and 13, the DPA explained that the King enjoys immunity on the basis of the Belgian Constitution. Whether this immunity extends to his collaborators, however, was controversial. ""Despite the absence of an indisputable and irrefutable normative basis to support it, and despite the fact that the right to data protection is a fundamental right"", the DPA considered that the majority doctrine was in favor of extending immunity. It therefore declared the complaint inadmissible, noting that this did not remove the illegality of the conduct, and invited the controller to comply with Articles 12 and 13.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 15"
"After suffering mental abuse and threats, person A (controller) recorded telephone calls from her ex-partner (and father of her child) B and forwarded the evidence to the police, lawyers and the public prosecutor. B, the data subject, stated that these recordings were made without his knowledge and consent. He therefore lodged a complaint with the Icelandic DPA.","The DPA distinguished between two operations: the recording of phone conversations and their transmission to the police. For the recording of the phone calls, the DPA explained that the processing of data by an individual that only concerns his or her private interests or those of his or her family is not subject to the GDPR.

However, the transfer of the recordings to the police was subject to the GDPR as they were outside the private sphere. The DPA considered that it was necessary to transfer the recordings to the police for A's safety. A therefore demonstrated a legitimate interest in the processing in accordance with Article 6 GDPR which superseded B's interest in protecting his privacy.

The DPA also found that the principle of minimisation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR was respected. As regards the right to information under Article 13 GDPR, the DPA balanced B's interest in receiving this information against the controller's (A) urgent interest in informing the police. It concluded that Controller A was not obliged to provide the information under Article 13.

In conclusion, no violation was found and the complaint was therefore rejected.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13"
"This case is an appeal of a decision in which the DPA fined a municipality (the controller) about €352,555 (NOK 4,000,000) for violating Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 24 GDPR and Article 32 GDPR after a serious ransomware attack led to highly sensitive personal data being irreparably lost and sold on the dark web.

The controller disagreed with the DPA on the part of the decision pertaining to the fine and asked them to reconsider their position. After the DPA had reviewed the case again, they found no grounds to change their decision and so, as per Norwegian procedures, referred the case to the Privacy Appeals Board.

In their comments to the Privacy Appeals Board, the controller argued that the grounds for an administrative fine were non-existent. They also held that they had implemented sufficient technical and organisational measures available to them as per their internal resources and in line with Article 24 GDPR and Article 32 GDPR.","The Privacy Appeals Board reviewed the case, both parties' arguments, grounds for imposing an administrative fine as per the GDPR, as well as the objective and subjective grounds for assessing if personal data breaches took place.

After assessing the controller's personal data practices, the Privacy Appeals Board held that they agreed with the DPA in that the various deficiencies represented fundamental shortcomings in the controller's information security, resulting in violations of Article 24 GDPR and Article 32 GDPR.

When assessing the subjective grounds, however, the Privacy Appeals Board noted that the DPA had taken an incorrect legal standpoint and interpreted the legality inaccurately. They disagreed with the DPA's interpretation that the Chief Municipal Executive was objectively responsible for the personal data breaches, regardless of him acting negligent. In the Privacy Appeals Board's view, the insufficient IT security must be sees against a lack of focus over time, long before the Chief Municipal Executive was employed only about half a year before the personal data breaches. The Privacy Appeals Board thus assessed if one or more employees responsible for IT security in the municipality had acted negligent and found that this was indeed the case. Consequently, they held that also the subjective grounds imposing a fine were present.

Finally, the Privacy Appeals Board agreed with the DPA's assessment regarding the grounds for, and level of, an administrative fine, thus rejecting the controller's appeal and upholding the DPA's decision to impose a fine of €352,555 (NOK 4,000,000).",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83"
"The controller in this case was Meta Platforms Technologies Ireland Limited (hereafter Meta).

Following a suspected data leakage concerning around 3,000,000 Belgian Facebook users, on 7 April 2021, the Belgian DPA called on Belgian citizens to check on the website https://benikerbij.be whether their data were part of the data leakage and if necessary to lodge a complaint with the DPA. Following this call, 1,113 complaints were lodged.

On 14 April 2021, the Irish DPC opened its “own volition inquiry” to determine whether Meta complied with its privacy obligations with the functionalities Facebook Search, Facebook Contact Importer, Messenger Contact and Instagram Contact. On 29 July 2021, the Irish DPC was notified of the existence of complaints regarding the events under investigation with the Belgian DPA.

In September 2022, under Article 60(3) GDPR, the DPC submitted a draft decision to various DPA’s, including the Belgian one who communicated their objections. In particular, in contrast to what the DPC had held, the Belgian DPA considered that data scraping should have been considered a data breach and that Meta had a duty to inform its users of the data leakage.

On 25 November 2022, the DPC adopted its final decision. Its investigation revealed that in the Facebook search tool, the default settings allowed all users to find each other's profiles via their phone numbers or email addresses (with a possibility to deactivate it manually). It therefore concluded that there was a strong risk that the phone numbers and email addresses would be scraped and linked to the identity of their owners. It also held that after the leakage, Meta did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures and failed to demonstrate that it had conducted a risk analysis.

Therefore, the DPC found a violation of  Article 25(1), 25(2), 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(f) GDPR, ordered Meta to comply with the provisions and imposed a Є150,000,000 and a Є115,0000 fine respectively for the violations of Articles 25(1) and 25(2).","The complaints in Belgium were related to a possible violation of Articles 32 to 34 GDPR and the DPC decision focused on Article 25. The key question, according to the DPC, was not whether there was an unauthorized disclosure of personal data or some other form of data breach, but to what extent appropriate measures had been taken to ensure that the data protection principles were observed when implementing the choices of Meta users. For this reason, the DPC's investigation focused on Article 25. The Belgian DPA considered that the focus on Article 25 did not cause any prejudice to the complainants.

In the context of the cooperation procedure of Article 60 GDPR, the DPA considered to be bound by the DPC’s decision, which was exclusively competent. Therefore, it rejected the complaints in Belgium.",COMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34, Article 60"
"The data subject made a request under Article 17 GDPR for erasure of their personal data from submitted applications for social security assistance to the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration at municipality X (NAV). NAV refused to delete the personal data and cited the Norwegian Archives Act which requires storing the information for archival purposes. After this refusal the data subject contacted the State Administrator, which was stated on NAV's initial decision, to be the competent appeal body. The State Administrator rejected the complaint and informed that the Norwegian DPA is the correct complaint body in the case.

The data subject contacted the DPA, but the DPA disagreed with the State Administrator, and viewed the State Administrator is the competent appeal body in the case. The DPA viewed that a dispute about what is the correct inerpretation of the Norwegian Archives Act must be reported to the State Administrator.

The data subject then again contacted the State Administrator, which maintained its original view. The State Administrator also provided guidance on his understanding of the applicable rules. The data subject the again contacted the DPA requesting clarification on who is the competent appeal body but the DPA maintained its own view.

The data subject appealed against this decision, but The DPA rejected the complaint on the grounds that it had been submitted after the appeal deadline of three weeks and did not find any special reasons that made it reasonable for the complaint to be nevertheless processed. The data subject also contacted the Civil Ombudsman which rejected the case and referred the data subject to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board.","The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board held that the conditions for trying the appeal had clearly been met after the appeal deadline being missed and gave the data subject compensation for missing the appeal deadline.

The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board emphasized, firstly, that the DPA is the competent supervisory authority when it comes to requests for deletion pursuant to Article 17(1) GDPR, and secondly, that the DPA must also decide on the scope of the exceptions that follow from Article 17(3)(b) GDPR and 17(3)(d)GDPR which goes also to requests for erasure of data in archived documents from public authorities. The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board viewed that the DPA had not carried out a substantive assessment of the data subject's erasure request. Given the history of the case, the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board did not deem it appropriate to send the case back to the DPA for a new assessment. Therefore, the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board eventually decided on the data subject’s erasure request claim as the first instance.

The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board stated, firstly, that Article 17(1) GDPR gives the data subject the right to have personal data about them deleted under certain conditions, and secondly, that the relevant option for demanding deletion in this case was Article 17(1)(c) GDPR (the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) GDPR and there are no more weighty reasons for the processing). The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board also established that Article 17(3)(b) and (d) GDPR include both an exception to the right to erasure: if the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation or for archival purposes in the public interest.

The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board eventually held that the data subject cannot demand that the information is erased from NAV's archive, if continued storage of the information is justified for archival purposes in the public interest under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, Article 6(3) GDPR, (and the Norwegian Personal Data Act § 8). The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board noted that under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR further processing of personal data for archival purposes in the public interest is not considered incompatible with the original purpose.

The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board referred to the State Administrators interpretation of the applicable rules and agreed with that interpretation of the law. In the State Administrators guidance, they viewed that under Section 6 of the Norwegian Archives Act, together with the provisions in Chapter 2 of the Norwegian Archives Regulation, that NAV has indeed an obligation to archive all case documents in social security assistance cases. Consequently, the NAV's rejection of the data subjects request for erasure was deemd to be legal under Article 17(3)(d) GDPR.

The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board decided that the data subject is not successful in their request for the erasure of data in the NAV's archive, in accordance with Article 17(3)(b) and 17(3)(d).",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17"
"The former employer of complainant received an e-mail concerning an invoice to be paid to
name of the complainant for a supplementary pension. Since the employment contract had already ended, the former employer
asked the defendant to contact the pension insurance company complementary to understand the reason for issuing the invoice. The insurance company indicates that she was not informed of the end of the contract of work between the complainant and his former employer, and that she therefore issued a new invoice. In this context, the complainant considers that his personal data should not have been sent, as the defendant is not an insurance broker or policyholder.

At first instance, the complainant made a request for mediation to the DPA. However, he was not satisfied with the outcome and thus filed a complaint afterwards.","In accordance with article 6.1.f GDPR and the case law of the CJEU, three cumulative conditions must be fulfilled in order to process personal data based on legitimate interests:
a) Purpose criterion: the pursuit of a legitimate interest;
b) Necessity criterion: demonstrating the necessity of the processing to achieve the purpose;
c) Weighing of interests: the rights and freedoms of the data subject must not override the legitimate interest pursued by the controller

Each criterion is briefly discussed below:
a) Purpose criterium: the DPA states that the personal data of the complainant were passed on to the insurance company in the context of an assignment entrusted to the defendant by the former employer of the complainant. The first condition is therefore fulfilled.

b) Necessity criterion: In order to satisfy the second condition, it must be shown that the same result cannot be achieved by other less intrusive means of processing of personal data The litigation chamber is of the opinion that with regard to the above-mentioned purpose, finding the origin of the invoice received in the name of the complainant, could not have been reached by means other than email exchanges.

c) Weighing of interests (recital 47 GDPR): It is important to take into account the expectations of the data subjects. After sending the said invoice, it appeared that the insurance company had not been informed of the termination of the complainant's employment contract. In this context, it may reasonably be expected that the defendant will provide the insurance company with the personal data that reveal the origin of the invoice. This data was also limited to elements necessary to understand the origin of the invoice.

"The Finnish DPA received a submission from a complainant regarding a data controller's processing of personal data in connection with a lottery. As a condition for participating to the lottery requested the participants to consent to direct marketing.

According to the lottery, the complaint concerned a marketing campaign related to the company's 30th anniversary including a lottery for the customers, and the rules for the lottery said that in order to participate, a customer had to give their consent for direct marketing. Consent was given by ticking a box saying ""Yes, I want to participate to the lottery and subscribe to direct marketing or I am already a subscriber"".  After receiving the first marketing email or newsletter, a data subject could unsubscribe by following instructions on the email.","The Finnish DPA considered the following questions: 1) is consent for direct marketing freely given as required under Article 4 (11) GDPR when consent is a condition for participating in a lottery, and 2) has the data controller complied with Article 7(3) GDPR and provided a possibility to data subjects to withdraw consent.

The Finnish DPA viewed that it is undeniable that participating to the lottery is depending on consent for marketing, and that a consent is not voluntary if data subject does not have real option to not give consent without having negative consequence. The DPA noted that the European Data Protection Board has stated that adding consent to agreement terms is strongly undesirable.

The DPA stated that the wording in Article 7(4) GDPR is not absolute and that the view of the European Data Protection Board has been, there may be some rare cases where this conditionality would not invalidate the consent.

When assessing whether consent is valid, the DPA paid attention to the purpose of processing personal data which in the case was about voluntary participation in the lottery. The Data Protection Commissioner emphasizes the importance of voluntary consent, but notes that the case in question is not about a service that is necessary for the data subject. According to the DPA, not participating in the lottery does not cause negative consequences or harm to the data subject.

This said, the DPA decided that the consent requested by the controller for direct marketing in connection with participation in the lottery has been freely given in accordance with Article 4(11) GDPR, and it has fulfilled the condition for withdrawal of consent stipulated in Article 7(3) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 7, Article 95"

In connection with the employment at Securitas, the data subject was contacted by the Defense Intelligence Service (DK: Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste) (“FE”) as the data subject had been nominated for a security clearance, and therefore, was viewed to have been filled out an electronic form for the processing.

The data subject complained to the Danish DPA about Securitas disclosing their personal data to the FE, as the data subject stated that they had not consented to such disclosure. The data subject stated that Securitas had disclosed their personal data (job title, full name, and social security number).

The data subject argued that they had not completed the “information form 2” to which Securitas referred to, and therefore, no declaration of consent had been given. The data subject argued that their personal data had been disclosed to the FE without their knowledge.

Securitas argued that the disclosure of the data subject’s personal data to the FE as well as the PET was justified. Securitas stated that, at the time of the disclosure of personal data, the complainant was employed as a security guard and that all such “on-call employees” are informed of the requirement for security clearance through a communication portal.

Securitas argued that the data subject had completed the “information form 2” and so, a declaration of consent. Securitas stated that the application for security approval would have been rejected, if the data subject had not completed, signed, and consented to it.","The DPA initially notes that consent, under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, will only rarely fulfil the requirement of having been submitted voluntarily due to the unequal relationship that typically exists between the employer and the employee.

However, the DPA found that Securitas was authorized to pass on the data subject’s personal data pursuant to the balancing of interests rule under Article (6)(1)(f) GDPR, according to which processing of personal data can take place if the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.

This file must include among other things the information received from the patient and the reasons for hospitalisation.

This data could therefore be entered in the data subject's medical file and processed in accordance with Articles 6(1)(e) and 9(2)(h) of the GDPR.

The car rental platform has committed to cover any possible additional expenses (such as tolls, extra kilometers driven, parking fees, compensations) to car owner(s), as well as, deductibles to the insurance company in cases of damage. Thereafter, the car rental platform claims the expenses form the car renter. Regarding a deposit, the car rental platform consideres a deposit inadequate, since a deposit high enough to cover the financial risks would make the rental price unacceptably high. This said, the controller argued that it is necessary to credit assess renters.

The controller carried out a credit assessment on the data subject when the data subject wanted to rent a car through its platform. Due to a payment notice, the data subject was prohibited to rent a car through the platform. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR when it processed personal data for these credit assessment purposes.","The Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board (PAB) took the view that the car rental platform assumes a considerable financial responsibility when a rental agreement is entered into through its platform, and that therefore, the controller depends on  renters having ability to cover possible addtitional expenses.

The PAB took in consideration that the controller had stated that its commitments have caused the company large expenses as a result of non-payment. Additionally, the PAB did not disagree with the controller regarding the deposit, and the PAB took the view that a deposit is not an equally suitable measure compared to credit assessment.

The PAB viewed that it is necessary for the controller to credit assess renters in order to reduce the company's financial risk. Therefore, the PAB found that the controller had a legal basis in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process credit information about the data subject.",COMPLIANT,Article 6
"The Tax Agency received information from the Probate Court (Skifteretten), including about the data subject’s inheritance, and shared the information with the Debt Agency, which then sought to recover the complainant's debt to the public sector.

The data subject complained with the Danish DPA about the fact that the Tax Agency had shared this information about them with the Debt Agency. Both authorities are part of the Tax Administration.

The data subject argued that it was unlawful that information obtained for one purpose was shared for other purposes. The Debt Agency viewed that it has a legal basis under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR to process the personal data it received from the Tax Agency.","The DPA considered that the Tax Agency and the Debt Agency both have official authority to carry out their respective official duties (including tax assessment and debt recovery), and therefore, both authorities have a legal basis to process the personal data in question under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR.

In light of the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR, the DPA also assessed whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data was originally collected, in accordance with Article 6(4)(a) and 6(4)(e) GDPR. The DPA found that 1) there is a significant connection between the tasks of the two administrations, and that 2) the data subject should reasonably expect that information about income in the form of (future) inheritance is held up against information about debt to the public.

Eventually, the DPA found that the sharing of personal data that took place between the Tax Agency and the Debt Agency had been carried out in accordance with the GDPR - including the principle of purpose limitation.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The owner of a petrol station, who is the controller in this case, installed a video camera for his business above the door of the house of the data subject. The two parties were cousins who had a bad personal relationship. The camera is located 1.2km away from the controller's business and covers a range of 60m. The camera shows the entrance to the data subjects garage and a small part of the pavement infront of it. The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos - AEPD) on 16 March 2021 about the fact that the controller installed the camera there eventhough his business is located 1.2 km away from it, accusing the controller of illegally monitoring and processing personal data of the data subject. The complaint was forwarded to the controller and collaboration with local security forces (Guardia Civil) was sought out. The Spanish DPA has rejected the complaint because there were informational signs in the area indicating the video surveillance and there was no evidence that the controller is processing the data subject's personal data. Thus, the AEPD issued a resolution proposal for closure of proceedings on 23 May 2022 based on the presumption of innocence.","The DPA recalled that the data to be processed should be minimised to what is necessary according to Article 5(1)(c)  GDPR. The AEPD stated that, the video surveillance by the controller does not constitute an infringement of Article 5(1)(c) because there is no indication of processing of personal data of the data subject or any form of going above what is necessary.

The DPA also mentioned Article 22(2) Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter: LOPDGDD) which states that video surveillence of public propperty is allowed, if it is necessary for safety reasons. In the case the camera captures a small part of the public pavement which, according to the DPA, alignes with the provisions stated in Article 22 (2) LOPDGDD.

The DPA therefore concluded that the video monitoring happened in a legal manner and the presumption of innocence prevails for the controller. Thus, the complaint has been rejected.",COMPLIANT,Article 5

Further investigation showed the email address had been processed in the USA by ActiveCampaign Ltd., but no signed agreement or SCCs were available. 6 months later agreements were made available which showed them to be signed only after the data subject started to ask for them.","The primary decision of the AP was that none of the alleged infringements were proven, the complaint did not meet the conditions for further investigation and no enforcement action would be taken. On appeal the AP adjusted the motivation to confirm that GDPR article 6 was infringed, but upheld the original decision not to take enforcement action.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 28, Article 46"
"A data subject in Italy received by mail a credit card from a bank based in the Netherlands. Since they had never had any contact with the financial institute, the data subject made an access request under Article 15 GDPR which was never answered. A complaint was therefore filed with the Italian DPA. The latter transferred the complaint to the Dutch DPA in the context of the cooperation mechanism envisaged by Article 60 GDPR. The Dutch DPA, considered itself leading supervisory authority pursuant to Article 56 GDPR, and asked the controller to clarify some points. The controller claimed to have received a request for the creation of a bank account by a an individual using the complainant's personal data. Whilst the account creation had meanwhile been interrupted due to suspicion of fraudulent behaviour by the applicant, the credit card had nonetheless already been sent to the data subject’s address. Furthermore, the controller claimed not to have received a proper request from the data subject.","The Dutch DPA considered these elements sufficient to exclude any GDPR violations. The Dutch DPA issued a draft decision which dismissed the complaint. The Italian DPA agreed with the content of the decision. Therefore, the decision became binding for all the DPAs pursuant to Article 60(6) GDPR. Under Article 60(8) GDPR, the Italian DPA adopted the final decision and notified it to the complainant.",COMPLIANT,Article 60
"Information of the ethnicity of a child's parent (the data subject) appeares in a journal note of the child welfare services of a Norwegian municipality (the controller). The journal note is a reproduction of what information the data subject themself had provided to the controller.

Additionally, the data subject had expressed to the controller that they feel that the child welfare case is about racism and represents a witch hunt against them from the municipality's side because of their family's belonging to a minority group.

The data subject requested the controller to delete information on their ethnicity pursuant to Article 17 GDPR from their child's records, because they viewed that such information was irrelevant with regard to the controller handling their child's case. The controller refused to delete the information, because it argued to have a statutory obligation to document and archive the information under national law. The data subject complained about the controller's refusal to delete the data to the Norwegian DPA.

The DPA found that the exceptions under Article 17(3)(b) and (d) GDPR applied in this case, since the controller had vuewed the information as worthy of archiving in accordance with archiving obligations laid down by national law. Therefore, the Norwegian DPA held that the controller had not violated the data subject's right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR by refusing to delete the data.

The data subject complained about the DPA's decision. The case was transmitted the to the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board for an assessment.","In its decision, the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board clarified that Article 17(3)(b) GDPR makes an exception to the right to erasure when the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation and Article 17(3)(d) GDPR when the processing is necessary for archival purposes in the public interest.

Furthermore, the board found that, since the case had been closed, the purpose of continued storage of the information was archival purposes in the public interest in accordance with national law. It follows from Article 5(1)(b) GDPR that further processing for archival purposes in the public interest is not considered incompatible with the original purpose.

Essentially, the board viewed that deletion of the information on the data subject's ethnicity depends on whether the information is necessary to understand the context and content of the journal note and the child welfare service's handling of the case of concern. The board considered it to be a sufficient justification, when the controller argued that the information is essential to understanding why the family has the understanding of the case that they have as well as the reactions the family have had during and after the case.

In addition, the board held that there must be a high treshold for making a decision on the deletion of personal data in the child welfare records, in line with previous practice (see PVN-2018-02).

"In December 2020, the DPA received a complaint by the complainant that their authorisation had been invoked by Netgíró ehf. (the controller) due to credit rating information given by Creditinfo Lánstrausts without prior to informing the claimant i.e. data subject of data transmission.

The data subject argued that to gain access to Creditinfo's information about themself, they had to agree to the company's use of certain additional information from its debt position system when calculating their credit rating. Additionally, Creditinfo allegedly used incorrect information from the debt position system in the calculation, as the IL fund communicated information to the system about the complainant's debt to the fund even though they had already paid the debt in question.

Netgíró ehf. have been prohibited from using information about Creditinfo's credit rating, which has been incorrectly calculated, and that the company is obliged to notify the borrower (this case the complainant) in advance when it intends to cancel the borrower's authorization due to changes in Creditinfo's credit rating.

The defendants in this case argued that the data subject had in fact been notified and reminded that they can withdraw their consent at any point and that Creditinfo was considered a processor in the debt position system.","The DPA held that the processing of financial data is considered personal data and falls under the authority of the DPA. The DPA is responsible for monitoring the implementation of Act No. 90/2018, on Data Protection and the Processing of Personal Data, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and Act No. 75/2019, on the Processing of Personal Data for Law Enforcement Purposes.

The controller is responsible for ensuring that the processing of personal data complies with Act No. 90/2018 and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR).

In the present case there are three controllers. Firstly, Creditinfo is the controller of the processing that involved the use of information registered with the company for the preparation of reports on the complainant's credit status. Secondly, the ÍL Fund is the controller of the processing involved in the transmission of information about the complainant in the Creditinfo debt ranking system. Thirdly, Netgíró is the controller of the processing that the undertaking itself carried out in assessing the applicant's creditworthiness when requesting financial assistance from the complainant.

"During a hearing as part of an asylum application, an employee of the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (controller) took photographs with his private phone of social networks of the applicant (data subject). The photographs were added to his file.

The data subject was concerned whether this was standard practice and what happened with the pictures on the mobile phone. The CGRA responded to the data subject that the employee only had his best interests at heart, i.e. an effective and swift procedure. Unsatisfied, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA.

In its defense, the controller stressed that it provides its employees with work equipment and that there is no BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy. The usage of a private mobile phone was thus not allowed. It emphasised that this practice is neither widespread nor official and this has been communicated to the employee in question, as well as all other employees to prevent similar situations from occurring. The controller also added that the pictures were deleted immediately after the interviews.","The Belgian DPA established that the taking of photographs with a private phone constituted processing of personal data according to Article 4(1) and Article 4(2) and that the employer was the controller according to Article 4(7), regardless of the employee acting in breach or in compliance of internal procedures.

The DPA noted that the awareness measures to prevent further incidents constituted a good practice.

Concerning the use of private phone, the DPA stated that the implementation of BYOD for work related activities is not a problem per se but can present certain risks, a risk assessment is thus required, especially when dealing with personal data in a sensitive context, such as an asylum application.

In this case, the DPA concluded that nothing pointed towards a breach of the GDPR, regardless of the usage of personal equipment being against the controller's policy. The DPA reminded that the pictures were taken in favour of the data subject and were removed immediately from the personal device when retention was no longer required.

Based on the above, the DPA dismissed the complaint.",COMPLIANT,Article 4

The recording contained the complainant’s private conversations they had at home where every word could be discerned. The complainant requested the recording to be deleted, but the neighbour refused to delete the recording.

Thereafter, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Icelandic DPA. The complainant stated to the DPA that they were not able to confirm whether the recordings had been shared with others. Furthermore, it appeared in the complainant's answers that there was a dispute with the neighbour that had been been going on for some time, inter alia, because of the issue of acoustics in the house.

Despite multiple requests by the DPA, the neighbour did not provide any statements on their behalf with regard to the complaint.","Generally, this type of processing would fall within the scope of the GDPR. However, in the present case the Icelandic DPA recalled that the GDPR includes an exemption were personal data is processed by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity pursuant to Article 2(2)(c) GDPR.

The DPA noted that the neighbour had not opposed to any of the complainant’s allegations. However, it was found that nothing in the present case suggested that the recording would have been communicated to anyone other than the complainant.

In the DPA’s view, the recording in question and its dissemination were solely intended for the neighbour's personal use, in relation to their dispute with the complainant, with regard to the issue of acoustics in the house. Consequently, the DPA held that the audio recording and its transmission to the complainant falls under the so-call “household exemption” under Article 2(2)(c) GDPR.

The data subject asked the DPA whether the CCTV images could be used to impose a fine.","The DPA started by clarifying that there are two parties involved in the CCTV data processing. The controller of the images itself (a municipality), and a processor who used these images to impose fines.

The DPA held that the controller can rely on public interest under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR to prevent illegal dumping, littering, and protecting public cleanliness. On top of that, the controller followed all the requirements as set out by article 5 Camerawet and articles 1 and 4 of KB 10 februari 2008.

The DPA did find several shortcomings in the Record of Processing Activities of the processor: incomplete contact details of the processor and the controller, incomplete & unclear categories of data subjects. As such, the DPA concluded a breach of article 30(2)(a) GDPR. The DPA noted that the DPO of the processor is also a safety consultant. This could result in a breach of Article 38(6) GDPR when the DPO has tasks that enable him to decide the purpose and means of processing.

"The data subject was active member of a religious community. They also held an official spiritual role within the church. After many years of service, an internal committee held that data subject committed a serious sin and publicly declared that they were no longer a member of the community.

The data subject claimed that by this public announcement the controller unlawfully processed their personal data. The data subject also requested access and erasure of some personal data and objected to the processing.

The controller claimed that data were processed pursuant to Articles 6(1)(c) and (f) and 9(2)(d) and (f) GDPR. Moreover, a religious organisation enjoys a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights and the European Treaties. The processing at issue fell therefore outside the State’s competence. The controller also stated to have fully replied to the access request.

The data subject claimed that at the time of their baptism they were only 13 and therefore not able to understand all the legal implications of the affiliation for their right to data protection. They also claimed that it would have been sufficient to bring their expulsion to the attention of only two people, without any need for a public announcement. Thus, the data subject lodged a complaint.","The Austrian DPA held to have no competence to review “internal matters” of a religious organisation, such as the decision to disclose information about the data subject’s expulsion during a public gathering of the church.

For the same reason, the Austrian DPA denied that Article 15 GDPR was applicable. Moreover, in an obiter dictum, the data subject’s claim that information provided was incomplete was rejected. According to the DPA, Article 15(3) GDPR does not give a data subject the right to request entire documents, such as cover and reference letters or the full assessment of someone’s “spiritual status”. It is sufficient that the controller provides the data subject with a copy of personal data undergoing processing contained in the documents, which is what the controller did in the case at issue.

The fact that the erasure of personal data was an “internal matter” of the church also excluded the applicability of Article 17 GDPR. According to the DPA, the formal exclusion of the data subject from the religious community does not mean that the data subject will no longer be regarded by the community as “spiritually” linked to the church.

Similar considerations applied to the right to object to processing pursuant to Article 21 GDPR.

The bank requested for the data subject’s social security number due to the banking transaction in question. The data subject considered that to be unlawful and claimed, inter alia, that the law on actions against money laundering and the financing of terrorism 140/2018 (Law 140/2018) does not require financial institutions - such as the bank - to identify the customers when the amount of the transaction does not reach a certain threshold amount.

The bank argued that it has a statutory obligation to prohibit anonymous transactions. In addition, the bank highlighted that the collection of social security numbers is important for the sake of the security and traceability of transactions. In other words, it is to ensure the reliability of transactions, to be able to correct possible mistakes in processing and/or to inform about identity theft, fraud, money laundering or other criminal acts.","In its decision, the Icelandic DPA noted that processing of personal data must have a legal basis under Article 6 GDPR. For example, the DPA stated that, in the present case, personal data may be processed on the basis of a legal obligation pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA noted that all processing operations must also comply with the general principles enshrined in Article 5 GDPR. The principles stipulate, inter alia, that personal data processed must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary (Article(5)(1)(c) GDPR).

In the context of the present case, the DPA concluded that the collection of a social security number is subject to the fact that it has a practical purpose and is necessary to ensure secure personal identification. Furthermore, the DPA noted that the controller in quetion is a financial institution and, therefore, falls under the scope of the Law 140/2018, and that the controller is a so-called 'reporting party'. The Law 140/2018 requires  to avoid anonymous transactions and obliges the reporting parties to know the identity of their customers.

The DPA considers that the data subject's name alone is not enough to ensure secure personal identification in banking transactions in accordance with the Law 140/2018. As a result, it was in practice necessary for the controller to obtain the additional information (social security number) for customer identification in order to fulfill its legal obligation(s).

As a conclusion, the Icelandic DPA found that it was necessary for the bank to collect the data subject's social security number in order to ensure their secure identification, in order to fulfill the requirements that rested on the bank according to the Law 140/2018. As a result no GDPR violation was found. The processing of the data subject’s personal data by the controller was permitted on the basis of Law 140/2018 to the effect that the processing was necessary to fulfill the legal obligation(s).

In this case, the DPA found that the latter scenario applied.

The media company submitted that it is among its tasks under the code of journalistic ethics to decide to publish certain information it believes to be in the public’s interest, as in this case.

The data subject still claimed that his personal data should not have been published and asserted that such data had been forwarded to other recipients without a legal basis and filed a complaint with the AZOP.","The AZOP considered the case in light of the GDPR and the Croatian Media Act (Zakon o medijima), which sets the conditions for information to be published on the media and guarantees freedom of expression, independence of the media, freedom to collect information and respect for human dignity. According to the Media Act, freedom of the media may only be restricted in a narrow set of cases where this is necessary in a democratic society, which also includes protection of the reputation or rights of others and prevent disclosure of confidential information.

Article 8 also states that when a justified public interest prevails, there can be no violation of the right to privacy. In addition to this, the Law on the Right to Access to Information stipulates that public authorities must publish information about granted grants and the beneficiaries thereof.

With regards to the articles in question, the AZOP held that the lawful basis for processing of personal data according to Article 6(1) GDPR are the provisions of the Media Act. As a consequence, the AZOP found that the information published about the complainant is to be considered a matter of public interest, especially given his political engagement.

Further, the AZOP did not consider that the controllers in this case failed to respect the principle of data minimisation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR since information about these kinds of grants and how they are calculated is publicly available.

The sheriff was held to have not breached the GDPR. The processing of the case file was lawful under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR as it was necessary for the exercise of official authority.

"On 15 June 2018, a complaint was brought jointly by two data subjects, employed at a municipal school as teachers, against the municipal authority which acted as the governing body of the school.

The complaint concerned two alleged infringements of the GDPR:

1. The publication of a series of Board reports on the school's online platform on 23 November 2017. The reports contained incriminating statements made against the first data subject.
2. The publication of the results of a student survey concerning the second data subject. This survey was published on the school's platform on 22 January 2018.

Both the reports and the survey were removed from the online platform before the data subject's had filed the complaint. The reports were taken down on 9 May 2018, and the survey was removed on the same day as its publication (22 January 2018).

On 4 July 2018, the complaint was declared admissible by the Belgian DPA and a formal investigation of the matter was commenced on 11 October 2019.","The DPA issued a dismissal of the orginial complaint as the processing (the publishing and removing of the reports and survey) took place prior to the GDPR's entry into force on 25 May 2018. However, the DPA found several violations outside of the scope of the complaint.

Firstly, prior to assessing the violations, the DPA clarified the data processing roles of the school and the municipality. In particulary, the Belgian DPA found that the municipal body was the controller for the purposes of Article 4(7) GDPR, as the management of the school was under the administrative authority of the municipality. The DPA acknowledged that the school held high levels of autonomous decision-making powers regarding educational decisions, but adopted the EDPB's reading of Article 4(7) GDPR. The EDPB on this matter, notes that ""an organisation can still be the controller even if it does not make all the decisions about the ends and the means.""

Secondly, the DPA found a breach of Article 37 GDPR. As a public body, the school was obliged to designate a data protection officer under Article 37(1)(a) GDPR, as well as to publish the contact details of the DPO and communicate them to the DPA under Article 37(7) GDPR. The municipal body had a DPO whose functions extended to the school, but the school did not have its own separate DPO. Moreover, the controller failed to publish their DPO's contact details. Consequently, the DPA found a violation of Article 37(1)(a) GDPR as the school acted as a public body in its own right and should have had a seperate DPO. Moreover, the failure to publish the municipal DPO's contact details was a breach of Article 37(7) GDPR.

Thirdly, the DPA found a breach of Article 39 GDPR, which establishes the tasks of the DPO. The municipality's DPO was employed for 120 hours annually, to fulfill its tasks for the municipality, the school in the current case, and another school under the municipality's administration. The DPA held that 120 hours was wholly inadequate. The DPO was not systematically involved in the operations of the school and municipality at all. Resultantly, the DPA found a breach of Article 39(1) GDPR.

Fourthly, the DPA found that no register of data breaches were being kept, as required by Article 33(5) GDPR. The controller stated that ""no data breaches had taken place since the last one which was registered,"" as the DPA could not verify whether another data breach took place or not, the DPA found a breach of the principle of accountability under Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 33(5) GDPR. Article 5(2) GDPR establishes the principle of accountability which obliges controllers to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.

Lastly, the DPA found a violation of the disclosure obligations under Article 13(1)(a) GDPR. This provision obliges the controller to publish the controller's contact details. The DPA found that the controller did not adequately provide the information, and the information that was provided was unclear. Thus the controller was in breach of Article 13(1)(a).

In conclusion, the DPA found violations of Articles 5(2), 13(1)(a), 37(1)(a), 37(7), and 39 GDPR. The DPA issued no fine, but ordered the controller to create an action plan within 3 months to comply with the GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 37, Article 39"
"The complaint concerned an alleged data breach.

The data subject argued that the information incorrectly registered included payment details and the data subject's power of attorney.

On 4 July 2023, the data subject submitted a complaint to the Belgian DPA.","The Belgian DPA dismissed the case on ""policy grounds"", mainly on the basis that no personal or social impact was caused as a result of the GDPR violations. The DPA notes that ""in order to evaluate the foregoing [complaint] ... the [DPA] ... takes into account the criteria that European Data Protection Authorities handle processing operations with a 'high risk' within the meaning of Article 35 GDPR.""

Firstly, the Belgian DPA created a test of ""major social and/or personal impact"" as a criteria for evaluating complaints. Moreover, the DPA takes the concept of high risk processing from Article 35 GDPR, which is an article directed at controllers and uses it as a basis for evaluating the admissibility of complaints. Article 35 GDPR imposes an obligation upon controllers to conduct a risk assessment of their processing activities, where the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (Data protection impact assessment or DPIA). The Belgian DPA has taken the concept of high risk processing and has extended it to its criteria used in evaluating complaints.

Secondly, the Belgian DPA read Article 35 GDPR in line with Article 77 GDPR. The DPA interpreted the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority under Article 77 GDPR , concluding that the right to lodge a complaint is not absolute. On this point, the Belgian DPA stated that:

""However, this objective right of complaint does not imply that every complaint can and will be thoroughly investigated by the competent authority, given its intrinsic nature and lack of resources. The Belgian legislator has in this regard explicitly recognised 'the need for theData protection authority to be able to act selectively with a view to an effective and efficient enforcement policy.'""

The Belgian DPA dismissed the complaint as it found a lack of ""major social and/or personal impact,"" a test which the DPA has drawn from Article 35 GDPR. It argued that as a result, there was no reason to further investigate the complaint, despite having acknowledged the existence of prima facie violations of the GDPR.",COMPLIANT,Article 35
"On 5 August 2022, the data subject filed a complaint against the Directorate of Primary Education.

The data subject wanted to conduct a genealogical investigation on his family surname. He sent an email to the Directorate of Primary Education (the controller), requesting access to their pupil registration database to search the entries of his surname therein.  In addition, the data subject requested in his complaint that the Authority order the Directorate of Primary Education to allow him immediate research access to the books of the closed/abolished Primary School's curriculum, to research the surname entries in them. The controller replied that they were only able to provide him with numerical data (number of pupils per year) and not the names, as this would be an unlawful disclosure of personal data.

The Authority dismissed the complaint, holding that there was no violation of the data subject's rights and that access requests for research purposes was not within the competence of the Authority to order. In particular, the Authority considered that his request to the controller (Directorate Primary Education) did not constitute an exercise of the right of access to personal data concerning him/her under Article 15 GDPR, but a request to carry out scientific research.

On 26 October 2022, the data subject lodged an objection to the decision and a request for a review of his case, in which he alleged that his request was ""not a request to carry out scientific research, but a personal genealogical research, which is far from scientific research and the data in the requested search concern him and thus fall under Article 15 GDPR.""","The DPA rejected the request for review. Genealogical research on a family surname did not fall within the scope of Article 15 GDPR, as ""personal data concerning [the data subject]."" The data subject's request was not an access request for the purposes of Article 15 GDPR. He requested access to the Directorate's entire database (containing other data subject's personal data), not access to data directly relating to him.",COMPLIANT,Article 15
"The controller is a parking space provider using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Cameras. The controller used an ANPR system to facilitate the automatic opening and closing of entry bariers to the premises. After a customer payed for the parking time registed to a vehicle with a certain number plate, the exit to the premises automatically opened for a vehicle with that number plate.

Using this system, the controller collected the following information (1) the automatic registration of a car's number plate once it has entered the premises, (2) an exact timestamp of entering the premises and duration of parking, and (3) a picture of each vehicle.

On 12 July 2023, the data subject contacted the controller asking whether a data protection impact assessment had been undertaken prior to the implementation of the system, and if so, what the outcome of it was.

On 14 July 2023, the controller replied stating that their new payment mechanism ""guarantees the privacy of all users"", but disregarded the data subject's question regarding the data protection impact assessment.

On 18 July 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA regarding the controller's failure to respond adequately to their request.","The Belgian DPA dismissed the complaint on the grounds of (1) ""lack of sufficient personal impact"" for the purposes of Article 35 GDPR, and (2) ""insufficient documentary evidence"" that an ""effective"" infringement of the GDPR had taken place.

In reaching its conclusion on these two grounds, the DPA stated that ""the complainant raises a socially relevant issue, but does not demonstrate that an effective infringement of the GDPR has occured. As the complainant does not exercise any rights of a data subject and is merely asking for more information regarding a possible data protection impact assessment, the [DPA] finds that the grievances raised by the complainant do not meet the criteria of high personal impact.""

The DPA concluded that the burden of proof lay on the data subject to establish GDPR violations, and noted that the data subject could resubmit a complaint if they could demonstrate a breach of the duty to inform under Article 14 or lack of confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f).",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 14"
"From 1 November 2017 until 30 September 2019 the data subject was a temporary employee at the Single Resolution Board (SRB). On 29 September 2019, via email, the data subject requested from SRB a copy of all his personal data and all data referring to his person stored at SRB, based on the Regulation 2018/1725. This was because there had been two instances of access to his personal data stored in the European Commission’s personnel management IT system, on 12 June 2019. Thus, he wanted the EDPS to investigate whether those instances of access could have constituted a breach of his personal data. He also requested that measures be taken to prevent any unauthorised access, modification, processing or disclosure of his personal data stored at the SRB. On 17 February 2020, he reiterated his request to the SRB to confirm whether or not personal (in particular, HR-related) data concerning him was being processed, to provide a copy of his personal data and to restrict the processing of his personal data, while objecting to the processing of his personal data.

On 28 February 2020, the DPO replied the data subject with certain data concerning him, stating that SRB applies by analogy the Common Commission-level retention list for European Commission files and in view of Articles 11, 26, 81 and 127 of the applicable Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union and Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union, the SRB had the legal obligation to store personal file in accordance with the retention list and that his personal file was now archived and would be stored up to 8 years after the extinction of all his rights, and for at least 120 years after his birth date.

On 8 March 2020, the data subject requested the SRB to delete his personal data processed by the latter and reiterated his request for restriction of the processing of his personal data and for objection to the processing of such of his personal data which are not to be deleted. By emails of 20 March and 17 and 20 April 2020, the data subject reiterated his request for erasure, withdrawing his consent to the processing of those data by the SRB.

On 30 April 2020, the DPO responded to emails rejecting a request for data erasure. The DPO stated that SRB had a legal obligation to retain the individual's personal file based on European Commission rules and Staff Regulations. The DPO also emphasized that the data could not be deleted and explained the lengthy retention period of 120 years after the individual's birth date. He also mentioned the requirement to keep data in a single personal file to any EU institution as a potential new employer, and some of the data in the personal file were also kept in the context of a further and/or future financial obligation for its staff or their family members. Additionally, the DPO cited legal obligations for data retention under Regulation 2018/1725, which prevented the right to object. Regarding a request for data processing restriction, the DPO asked the applicant to specify the data whose accuracy he disputed according to Regulation 2018/1725.

On 20 March 2020, the data subject lodged a complaint with the EDPS against the SRB claiming that the processing and storage for 120 years violates his rights entitled by Regulation 2018/1725, in particular his right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) of Article 19, right to restriction of processing of Article 20 and the right to object of Article 23.

In the complaint, the data subject then asked the EDPS to instruct the SRB to comply with his requests in exercise of his rights, in particular the requested erasure of his personal data.

On 18 January 2021, the EDPS rejected the complaint by the first contested decision concluding:

* As for the right to erasure of Article 19 of Regulation 2018/1725, read in the light of Article 26 of the Staff Regulations, the SRB was under a legal obligation, within the meaning of Article 19(3)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, to keep the content of the applicant’s personal file. 
* Regarding the right to object to the processing of personal data of Article 23(1) of Regulation 2018/1725, the EDPS recalled that, under Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, processing of those data was lawful if it was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller of the personal data was subject and this  was indeed the case here.
* Request for restriction of the processing of his personal data, based on Article 20(1) of Regulation 2018/1725, the EDPS also considered that it should be refused. First of all, the EDPS rejected the applicant’s argument based on the assumption that his personal data held by the SRB were incomplete or inaccurate. He then noted that the processing was lawful within the meaning of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation 2018/1725, since it was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the SRB was subject pursuant to Article 26 of the Staff Regulations.
* Lastly, he recalled that the applicant had no right to object under Article 23 of Regulation 2018/1725, as previously established. The EDPS concluded therefrom that the applicant had no ground, in terms of Article 20(1) of that regulation, to obtain from the SRB a restriction of the processing of his personal data.

After a reviewal request made by the data subject on 17 February 2021, on 9 March 2021, the EDPS refused the applicant’s request for review by the second contested decision.

The data subject claimed for an annulment of the decision by European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) of 18 January 2021 rejecting his complaint (‘the first contested decision’), and of the decision from 9 March 2021 refusing his request for review of the first contested decision (‘the second contested decision’) (together, ‘the contested decisions’) and a compensation of €20,000 for the damage which he claims to have suffered as a result of the contested decisions.","CJEU highlighted that the SRB was right to refuse the data subject’s request.

Regarding the right to erasure, SRB have a legal obligation under Article 26 of the Staff Regulations, which requires them to keep all documents concerning the administrative status of the official or servant concerned and all reports relating to his or her ability, efficiency and conduct. This retention was necessary for pension rights and other potential legal claims.

The applicant did not develop any legal argument concerning the examination of the retention period for personal data in the light of the principle of proportionality and his complaint was limited to the request seeking erasure, the exercise of the right to object, and the exercise of the right to restrict the processing of the applicant’s personal data.

Ultimately, the court understood that EDPS did not infringe the right to good administration and that they acted in accordance with the law, and if the applicant wished to challenge the proportionality of the retention period, he could file a new complaint for further examination.

Regarding the second decision, the Court upheld the EDPS's decision to deny the review request, as the data subject did not provide new evidence or legal arguments justifying a review, and certain issues raised in the review request were outside the scope of the original complaint and decision.

The Court rejected all the data subject claims for review of the two decisions issued by EDPS and dismissed the compensation request of €20,000 since no unlawfulness vitiating in both decisions has been established.",COMPLIANT,Article 17
"In 2021 the Danish DPA has carried out inspections at several public authorities to see if they were complying with data protection rules. Among the inspected public authorities was Hedensted Kommune (Municipality of Hedensted). The inspection was due to the fact that the controller sent more notifications of data breaches than the national average.

The DPA carried out the inspection in 'written form', focusing especially on the implementation of Article 32(1) GDPR. On 21 June 2021, the DPA sent a letter to the controller notifying them about the investigation and formulating questions for them to answer. The controller was also asked to submit an example of how it instructed its employees.

On 9 August 2021, the controller submitted a statement with the relevant information to the DPA.","The DPA found no violation of Article 32(1) GDPR. The elements that the DPA took into account to exclude the existence of a GDPR infringement were the following.

In its reply, the controller stated that in case of data breach the people affected would be informed immediately via a phone call (where possible). Furthermore, the controller also emphasized that they put an effort to find the cause of the breach and to learn from their mistakes, especially discussing the accident directly with the employees involved. The DPA thus found that the controller was aware of the damage a breach can cause and willing to adopt sufficient remedial actions.

In order to prevent breaches, the controller also declared that they were continuously implementing new measures. If incidents recurred in a department, the DPO became involved in that department. From this perspective, the DPA observed that the controller took measures after data breaches happened in the past. For example, the controller set up a group that screened the access to documents before they were submitted in the context of an access request. The controller also implemented a scanning tool that could correctly blur documents containing personal data. In general, the DPA got the impression that the controller seriously committed to avoid further data breaches in the future.

Therefore, the DPA found that appropriate measures according to Article 32(1) GDPR have been taken.

Finally, the DPA found a decrease of notifications of data breaches from the controller since 22 June 2021.",COMPLIANT,Article 32
"The data subject made a complaint against the data controller since their personal data was used for allowing the loan for their sister buying a car. The data subject affirms that their personal data were processed by the data controller with no consent and alleged that they were set as the guarantor of the buying without their knowledge. However, there was evidence proving that the data subject knew about the transaction and, as mentioned by the data controller, the data subject is actually the co-owner of the car in dispute, not its guarantor.","The DPA ruled that processing the personal data of a subject who is the co-owner of the car bought via contract is legitimate, considering Article 6 of the GDPR. There is no need for consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data when they are part of a contract with the data controller. Since the data subject is a part of the co-owner of the car bought and does not act as a guarantor, the execution of a contract is a legitimate legal base for the processing of personal data. Thus, the DPA understood there was no breach of the GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6, Article 58, Article 83"
"A data subject visited the  website of the controller, and a cookie banner displayed, showing the options “accept” and “configure or reject use of cookies” the first being included in a button, written in white against a blue background and the latter option is designed as a link in the text of the banner. By accepting cookies, several cookies were installed on the complainant’s device and unique identifiers about the data subject were stored on the controller’s servers and transmitted to third parties; by clicking on “configure or reject use of cookies”, the data subject was redirected to a second layer showing the different categories of non-necessary cookies that one can tick and accept or leave unticked and thus reject, and save the settings. The option to reject cookies is thus only available in the second layer of the banner. In light of these features, the data subject claimed that the way in which the cookie banner was designed violated the GDPR and the consent given through such a banner cannot be considered a valid consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 4(11) GDPR.

Further, upon accepting, there appears to be no easy way for withdrawing one’s consent, since this can only be done by clicking on a link at the bottom of the webpage, “cookie policy”, which leads to the second layer of the banner where the cookie settings were displayed and where there is an option to untick cookies and save settings. This, according to the complainant, constitutes a violation of Article 7(3) GDPR.

Accordingly, the data subject, represented by noyb (European Centre for Digital Rights) filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA (DSB) against the controller and asked the DSB to order the controller to stop all processing operations and delete the complainant’s personal data and inform the third party service providers about the deletion, as per Article 17 GDPR and Article 19 GDPR. The DSB forwarded the complaint to the AEPD as the Lead Supervisory Authority in this case, which handled the case in line with Article 60 GDPR.","The AEPD  considered all the facts and submissions by both parties and assessed the legality of the cookie banner showed on the webpage based on its own visit of the site.

First of all, the AEPD noted that the new version of the Guidelines on the use of cookies of July 2023 is meant to integrate the principles set out by the EDPB in its “Guidelines 03/2022 on deceptive design patterns in social media platform interfaces: how to recognise and avoid them”, specifically, as regards the fact that the option to reject cookies should be included in the first layer of a cookie banner, so that it results as easy to grant as to reject consent. However, the AEPD stated that the new Guidelines will only be enforced from January 2024, at the latest, in order to allow for a transition period in which website operators will have time to adapt to them. In the meantime, the AEPD would continue to apply its Guidelines of 2020 .

As regards the fact that there was no reject button in the first layer of the cookie banner, the AEPD considered it lawful that the option to reject cookies is given in the second layer of the banner, since the “configure cookies” link leads to a layer where users have the chance to granularly choose the cookies to allow. This, the AEPD held, is in line with the provisions of the LSSI (Law of Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce). Also, the fact that the reject and accept options are presented, respectively, as a link and a button with higher contrast background, was not considered to be an issue by the AEPD, because, as submitted by the controller, these are accepted as valid design options in the 2020 Guidelines.

With respect to the possibility to withdraw one’s consent, the AEPD held that it is sufficient that the user of a webpage has access to a link redirecting to the cookie settings, in order for it to be compliant with Article 22 LSSI.

Consequently, the AEPD did not adopt any measures against the controller and archived the case.",COMPLIANT,Article 60

In this regard, the data subject points out how his compensation for the September was not paid through a current account, but the employee of the Croatian Post has brought him compensation. On that occasion employee asked him for his ID card. Therefore, the data subject considers that data controller disclosed his personal data about him as a user of the social benefit without his authorization.","The DPA rejected the complaint.

It emphasized that the right to protection of personal data is not absolute right, and it should be considered in relation to its function in society and harmonized with other fundamental rights in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

"On 16 May 2023, the the Hungarian DPA (NAIH) received a complaint from a minor's legal guardian, which alleged that a bank (the controller) had processed the minor's (data subject) personal data unlawfully. The minor's legal guardian had applied for a 'baby loan' ('Babaváró' loan) with the bank. These loans are for the purpose of financing child-related costs.

In order to process the loan application, the bank had requested a copy of the minor's identification documents, which included details such as the minor's residential address,  gender, birth date and national identification number. To do so, the bank relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract) as a legal ground for processing. In the complaint, the applicant argued that the processing was disproportionate and unnecessary for the purposes of their contract with the bank, which the minor was not party to.

In response to the complaint, the NAIH contacted the bank for more information. The bank responded that Article 14(4) and Article 9(2)(c) of Decree 44/2019. (III. 12.), which regulates the conditions of a “Babaváró” loan, requires banks to process minor's identification documents. Moreover, in order to be able to demonstrate compliance under domestic banking regulations, banks are obliged to document the basis on which they have granted loans and store any relevant information in relation to this.","The NAIH rejected the complaint. The NAIH held that Article 14(4) and Article 9(2)(c) of Decree 44/2019. (III. 12.), required banks to process the data referred to. Therefore the processing was legitimate as it was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller was subject (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR). The NAIH acknowledged that the bank had wrongly indicated  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for processing. However, the NAIH held that the indication of an incorrect legal basis for processing under Article 6 GDPR, did not make the processing illegitimate.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 77"
"On 17 January 2023, the complainant received an SMS message from the controller regarding certain shipping information. 15 minutes after this first SMS message, the complainant received a spam SMS message from an unknown sender.

Because of this, on 26 January 2023, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Slovenian DPA. It claimed that the controller did not adequately secure his phone number, a personal data, and did not take all measures to prevent their unauthorized use, as a result of which it received a spam SMS message.

The Slovenian DPA initiated proceedings against the controller and, on 10 March 2023, the DPA sent a request for clarification to the controller regarding the allegations.

The controller explained that the disputed telephone number had been provided by another company, which had to deliver an item to the complainant. It further stated that it does protect the shipment data it receives and does monitor its systems carefully, but in this instance, the phone number was publicly posted on several websites of different companies engaged in logistics activities.","Following the information provided, the DPA reiterated that the telephone number of a natural person is generally considered personal data, but not when it belongs to a legal entity.

In order to be ""personal"" in accordance with Article 4(1) GDPR, data must meet two conditions cumulatively: (i) the information must refer to an individual (a natural person) who (ii) must be specified or identifiable. In the present instance, since the controller processed the phone number in relation to a legal person and the telephone number in question related to a company, the DPA concluded that the telephone number in question did not constitute personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR.

"On the 14th of May 2023 a data subject lodged a complaint with the Maltese DPA. He complained that when terminating his employment, his employer (the controller) accessed his work emails and failed to provide him with a right to clear his mailbox. The data subject highlighted that he had personal documents on the account such as electricity bills.

The controller defended himself against these allegations to the DPA under when given the opportunity under Article 58(1)(a) GDPR. The controller stated that the access to the account had been granted desppite the termination of employment. This access had been granted because the data subject had highlighted the personal documents contained on the account. The controller submitted an email of this grant of access as evidence. The data subject was informed that after he had accessed what he required, the account would be deleted permanently.

The data subject rebutted these claims by only claiming that he was 'suspicious' that the government has already 'snooped' into all his mail.

The controller was given one final chance to rebutt the data subject's arguments. The controller gave evidence that at no point had they accessed the data subject's personal data within his work email. In fact, when they did access it in order to delete it, they noted that everything had already been erased within the account. This fact was confirmed by the data subject himself in an email.","The DPA dismissed the complaint.

As a preliminary point, the DPA noted that the work email account contained the data subjects personal data, as defined in Article 4(1) GDPR. Consequently, processing operations by the contoller must be GDPR compliant.

As to whether the controller accessed the data subject's work account, the DPA noted that the data subject failed to put forward any concrete evidence to support their claim that third parties accessed his mailbox. The Commissioner held here that a mere suspicion that someone has infringed your rights is not enough to lodge a complaint under Article 77 GDPR. Other than the deletion of the account, it cannot be proved that any other person accessed his email accounts.

The DPA analysed the evidence given by the controller. They noted that the data subject himself admitted that he had been given access to delete information on the account.

On the above basis, the Commissioner found no grounds to unequivocally state that the controller infringed the GDPR and dismissed the complaint.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 77"
"On 29 August 2023, the Danish DPA initiated a case concerning Rigsrevisionen's data processing. Rigsrevisionen (the processor) is an independent institution placed under the Danish parliament conducting audits to determine whether the public accounts are correct and whether government-funded agencies and enterprises comply with current laws and regulations. The DPA aimed to assess the legal basis of the data processing under Article 6 GDPR and how the processor ensures compliance with the principle of data minimisation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

The processor stated that its tasks follow the Danish Auditor General Act and special legislation. It emphasised that its processing is considered necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and Article 9(2)(g) GDPR. Although the processor further stated that it is not always relevant and necessary for its auditing activities to obtain personal data, its employees are instructed to justify and document if personal data is to be collected.

Following the report, the Danish DPA asked the processor to clarify its utilization of terminal access to access personal data. The processor explained that, in practice, terminal access is primarily used in connection with financial audits. Furthermore, its terminal access to the joint government IT systems, for example, is described in the agreement with the Danish Agency for Public Finance and Management. From the agreement, it appears that the employees of the processor can access the data in the joint governmental systems without contacting the authority whose data the access may concern when they have an official necessity. Nonetheless, ministries and agencies are informed about this automatic access to the information in the systems. Moreover, the processor clarified that it does not have unlimited terminal access to all the auditee's systems or cases, as the audited authority decides whether terminal access should be made available to the processor. Additionally, this system allows it to search for specific accounting documents and data, avoiding retrieving entire cases. The processor also explained that the alternative to this system would be retrieving the information by obtaining documents in physical form, for example. Therefore, it is believed that terminal access supports the principle of data minimisation.","Pursuant to the information provided, the Danish DPA found that the processor’s processing of personal data is within the GDPR. The DPA believed that the relevant legal basis for the processor's collection of personal data when performing auditing activities is Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, which states that processing is lawful if necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. It follows from Article 6(2) GDPR and Article 6(3) GDPR that this legal basis requires a supplementary legal basis in EU or Danish law. In light of this, the processor rightfully mentioned § 12(1) of the Danish Auditor General Act, which provides that the processor may demand that any public authority provide the documents necessary for the performance of its duties. 

In addition to having a legal basis for processing, any processing of personal data must also be in accordance with the fundamental principles of Article 5 GDPR, including the principle of data minimisation, under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. This means that when the processor performs its auditing activities, it may only obtain the information necessary for this purpose. Thus, considering the information provided by the processor, it acknowledged that the processor specifically instructed its employees to enter into dialogue with the audited authority to ensure compliance with the data minimisation obligation, including avoiding receiving certain data, such as civil registration data or other personally identifiable information if it is not relevant to the audit. Moreover, when the processor requests information from an authority, it explicitly draws attention to the principle of data minimisation, including that no more information is provided than requested and that personal data is pseudonymised/anonymised as far as possible before disclosure.

Additionally, considering the terminal access inquiry, the DPA found that the usage of this system was also based on several considerations of data protection.

Thus, the DPA found that Rigsrevisionen's collection of personal data when performing its auditing activities is within the framework of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9"

The data subject also claimed that such data constituted biometric data.

The office, as a controller, responded stating that it did have knowledge about the events which might possibly be related to the data subject but that it was not possible for it to determine the identity of the person in the pictures. Hence the processor refused to comply with the data subject’s access request.

Following this, the data subject filed a complaint with the Croatian DPA (AZOP) claiming that the controller violated her GDPR rights by not responding to her access request and she also stated that the controller further processed her personal data by making it available to various unauthorized persons as well as to the public through media articles.

In its submissions to the AZOP, the controller clarified that it did not unlawfully transmit or use personal data of the applicant, pointing out that it has learned about events that may have been related to the applicant, but from the information provided it was not possible to determine with certainty the identity of the person and its connection with other contents that were provided to the controller. Further, the controller underlined that it took all necessary measures to prevent the possibility of misuse or any other illegal and unauthorized actions related to the deletion of personal data. In conclusion, the controller stated that, upon request of the State Attorney, it sent the disputed letter to the employees of the Police Department of the city, as authorized officials, which was declared to be a confiscated object.  Further, it was submitted that the two news articles mentioned by the data subject do not contain any personal data allowing data subjects to be identified.","The AZOP, first of all clarified that the photos in question may constitute personal data, but not biometric data as they do not fulfil the requirements of Article 4(14) GDPR.

Secondly, the AZOP ascertained whether the controller had rightfully responded to the data subject’s access request. Making reference to Recital 63 and Article 12(1) GDPR, the AZOP underlined that controllers should provide data subjects with all the information requested in Article 15 GDPR. However, the AZOP underlined that under Article 12(2) GDPR, a controller may refuse to comply with an access request if it proves that it is unable to determine the identity of the data subject. In this case, the controller did prove its inability to identify with certainty the data subject

Thirdly, since the disputed letter and pictures were confiscated by the police, the controller was also justified for not complying with the data subject’s request of deletion of her personal data under Article 17(3)(e) GDPR.

Last, the AZOP also found that the newspaper articles mentioned by the data subject did not contain any personal data relating to her, this none of her data was published unlawfully.

On 11 April 2023, Data subject announced their dissatisfaction with the decision and listed a number of claims supporting their claims. After further communication, data subject first filled on 6 june 2023 a request for mediation in front of the ADP. Political Party maintained its position during the mediation and added in subsequent communication that person who was supposed to have disclosed the data did not have access to it at all.

Firstly, the ADP found that the data subject  claim of data disclosure was not sufficiently proven. During the mediation and proceedings, data subject claimed that the disclosure was supported by testimonies of several persons and police complaint but no such proof was presented. Data subject also claimed that the person who allegedly disclosed data communicated such fact to them, but did not present any communication which would prove this fact.   Data subject brought up also disciplinary action against the communications officer, who was supposed to have disclosed the data, carried out by the data controller, but ADP noted that it was not enough to prove that there was disclosure of personal data in the party.  Finally ADP decided  that there was no necessity to launch an investigation into the activities of the data controller join order to collaborate the claims of the data subject. Regardless of being proven or not, the grievance raised by the complainant does not correspond to the criteria of high general or personal impact. Therefore it is up to  the ADP to weigh up the personal impact of the circumstances of the complaint and to decide whether it is  appropriate to deal with the complaint further. Given the  the lack of substantial evidence and for the reasons of expediency, ADP decided not to investigate  the matter further.",COMPLIANT,Article 5
"The data subject was a member of a political party. On 10 March 2023, the data subject contacted the political party's data protection officer (DPO), claiming that their personal data was illegally disclosed to other members by the party's communication officer. The data subject objected to the disclosure and requested information on the measures which would be taken to address the disclosure.

On 03 April 2023, the political party's DPO replied, claiming that the data was processed in accordance with internal rules and that there had been no disclosure of the data subject's personal data.

On 11 April 2023, the data subject announced their dissatisfaction with the decision. After further communications with the party, on 6 June 2023, the data subject first filed a request for mediation to the APD, which was unsuccessful.

Firstly, the DPA found that the data subject's claim of a GDPR breach was not sufficiently proven. During the mediation and proceedings, the data subject claimed that the unlawful disclosure of their personal data was supported by testimonies of several persons and police complaints, but no proof was presented.

Secondly, the data subject also expressed dissatisfaction with the answers given by the DPO. Nonetheless, the Belgian DPA noted that the DPO always provided a reply to the data subject within the time limit imposed by Article 12(3) GDPR and Article 12(4) GDPR.

Therefore, the DPA concluded that the grievance raised by the data subject did not correspond to the criteria of high general or personal impact. After weighing the personal impact of the circumstances of the complaint, given the lack of substantial evidence and the significant resources this complaint would entail, the DPA decided not to investigate the matter further.

"A data subject received a letter from the umbrella association of Austrian social insurance institutions - the controller - suggesting him to show up for an appointment for a vaccine against covid-19. The data subject believed that the letter had been sent to him on the basis of unlawful processing of his personal data by the controller. He thus filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA (Datenschutzbehörde, DSB) on 23 December 2021, asking the DSB to prohibit such processing and impose a fine on the controller.

Given the high number of similar complaints, the DSB took for granted that the umbrella association was the controller and asked it to provide its submission on the matter.

On 14 January 2022, the controller submitted as sole controller it sent letters about the possibility of getting a covid-19 vaccine to those people who had not been vaccinated before a certain date. In the controller’s view, this was legitimate as it occurred on the basis of § 750(1a) and (2) of the Austrian General Law on Social Insurance (ASVG).","First of all, the DSB considered that the controller in this case is an entity under public law. The controller checked the central vaccination register whether the data subject had been vaccinated against covid-19 before 22 November 2021, and, as he had not, the controller retrieved the address of the data subject from the central patient register and sent him the letter.

The DSB also found that the sending of the letter with information about the risk of covid-19 and a suggestion of an appointment for a free vaccine were not unlawfully transmitted to third parties, in this case, a printing service provider. As a matter of fact, the latter, as a processor, later confirmed deletion of the data.

Further, the DSB concluded that, since the controller is a public entity acting in accordance with § 750(1a) and (2) ASVG, this justified a restriction of the right to data protection under §1(2) DSG, in compliance with Article 8(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFREU) and Article 6(1)(e) GDPR.

The DSB thus rejected the whole complaint as unfounded, since no rasons for ordering to cease processing nor to impose a fine on the controller were given.",COMPLIANT,Article 6
"A data subject, who was the ombudsman of a political party running for Iceland’s National Elections in 2022, was requested by the Kópavogur electoral board to carry with him an identification document specifying the political party he represented. In the data subject’s view, this constituted unlawful processing of his personal data under Article 9 GDPR and he filed a complaint with the Icelandic DPA.

The National Electoral Commission, as a controller, submitted that it is obliged under the National Elections Act no. 112/2021 to oversee the carrying out of elections and to supervise the implementation of the law. Among its responsibilities is ensuring that local electoral commissions and the appointed ombudsmen and other agents that are involved in the election process also act in accordance with the law. In this, it is important that both the electoral commission and the voters know who the ombudsmen are and which political party they represent. Further the controller referred to its ""Instruction of the National Electoral Commission on agents' credentials"" issued on 11 May 2022 to the local electoral commissions, according to which the name of the candidate for whom electoral agents work must be indicated on their badge during elections.","The Icelandic DPA first determined that the National Electoral Commission is to be regarded as the controller in this case.

Then it considered that personal data can be processed for fulfillment of a legal obligation in accordance with Article 6(1)(c) GDPR and it underlined the fact that political opinions constitute a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR and their processing must meet the conditions set out in Article 9(2) GDPR.

The DPA then considered Article 53 of Elections Act no. 112/2021 which regulates the submission of candidate lists and foresees that the local electoral boards must prepare the credentials to be shown on the basis of the instructions of the National Electoral Commission. The latter refer to the instructions of 11 May 2022 outlined above. For these reasons, the DPA concluded that the processing was lawfully based on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.

Further, the DPA assessed whether the processing was compatible with the principles of processing and the special conditions that apply to the processing of special categories of personal data.

As regards the political opinions of the data subject, the DPA ascertained that first, the data subject was informed about the information that would be shown on his badge and he consented thereto; secondly, it was established that he was a candidate for that party and deputy in a constituency for the same party in the past, so that his political views were already made public. Hence, the DPA held that the political opinion of the data subject was being processed in accordance with Article 9(2)(a) and (e) GDPR.

With respect to the principles of processing, the DPA held that the requirement of fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR was fulfilled to the extent that the controller is not obliged to provide information to the data subject under Article 13(4) GDPR if the latter already has knowledge of the information to be disclosed. Also, under Article 14(5) GDPR, the controller was exempt from providing information to the data subject, since the processing was clearly foreseen by law.

Thus, the DPA concluded that the processing of the data subject’s personal data by the National Electoral Commission was compatible with the GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 14"
"A student handed in a complaint against the University of Navarra because they asked the students to fill in their vaccination status. The complainant understands this as a breach of the data protection regulation because it would access the students medical records. The grounds are based on an e-mail from the University of Navarra, in which it announces to collaborate with the Navarro Health Service in the Vaccination against COVID-19 and it asks the students to inform about their vaccination status. On October 26, 2021 the University of Navarra replied to the complaint that the students were not coerced to give the information, but they were given the possibility to do so. The University does not process the personal data of the students without their explicit consent. The consent would in no case be vitiated since no condition has been established that could nullify the correct will of the interested party to the processing. There is no measure contrary to the interests of those students who do not provide the information freely and voluntarily. The sole purpose of the communication made is to comply with the objective of the collaboration agreement reached with the Government of Navarra by virtue of the actions taken in its place against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The complaint filed was admitted for processing on November 24, 2021 in Accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD. The collaboration was known to the public. There is a press release stating the fact that the University of Navarra should communicate the list of persons who are to receive the vaccine so that their identity can be recorded in the health databases. This is in compliance with a legal obligation in terms of prevention of legal risks. This is due to the severity of the pandemic. The form for acceptance of the data processing states that the compliance with the form is voluntary. The first field of the form is the request for consent. Furthermore it is added that the information provided will not be communicated to third parties unless the health authorities require it. This clause can also be accepted.","The Court does not consider that there is a violation of the provisions of the regulation in force regarding protection, and there is no substantive issue to support such an allegation.

In light of provisions (Article 4 (15) GDPR, Article 9 GDPR, Article 6 GDPR) the vaccination of a person against Covid-19 implies the provision of a health care service. Therefore the information about whether or not an identified natural person has received the Covid-19 vaccine is in the nature of personal data concerning health, falling within the category of special of sensitive data regulated in Article 9 GDPR. The task of the University was to provide the Navarra Health Department, Osasunbidea, with the lists of the people who were going to receive the vaccine so that they could be registered in the health database. The students that wanted to fill out the form on the vaccination were fully informed about the processing of the data, this is on the legal obligation to take care of the health of students in Article 7.1.n Royal Decree 1791/2010.

"The data subject made a complaint against the respondent, as organ's of the respondent searched through the data subject's office in 2020 and took seven pictures  on a private cell phone of the complainants office, the contents of a box and handwritten notes on files. The complaint is focused on the data processing that took place in the secret search and how the respondent violated the complainants fundamental right to privacy under the GDPR. The complaint was made in a timely manner because the complainant only found out after the oral hearing the data processing that occurred during the search of the office.The complaint was filed within the one year complaint period from the time the matter became know in connection with section 85 (4) GOG. The searched violated article 8 of the ECHR, the complainants right to a private life. It is clear the data processing was carried out, outside disciplinary  or criminal proceedings exclusively on behalf of the respondent which makes it clear this was not processed out by an impartial disciplinary court. This in turn affected the judicial independence of the judge. According to section 85 (1) GOG, a prerequisite  to admit a complaint is that it must violate a fundamental right to data protection by an organ that exercises judicial activity, which is not the case here as there is no connection with court or legal proceedings, it was an issue that took place in the company. The processing of data was necessary for official supervision and therefore, had no corresponding legal basis. The respondent requested the complaint to be rejected and if necessary dismissed. Initially, there was confusion over which court department this complaint needed to be assigned too, in the beginning it was not assigned to a court department as the authority  in charge assumed there would be a decision-complaint procedure, eventually the court departments  were assigned once the files attached were examined in the legal department and the contents were found to fall under Art. 130 Para. 2a B-VG. In addition, it is also accurate that the judge was a member of the personnel state and was involved in the process for the XXXX service appraisal, but the judge was not found to be acquainted with the complainant in this case and that the data protection issues which arose in this case have no connection  with the personnel's senates  assessment for XXXX.","As it was argued that the respondent while taking pictures that would allegedly violate the complainant's privacy rights under Article 55(3) GDPR, was under the context of judicial activity. The date the processing of the data took place by the respondent was a supervisory measure by the judicial administration carried out by the President of the BVwG in line with Section 3 Paragraph 1 BVwGG. The respondent had stated he did not act as a judicial official at the time of this data processing but an an administrative body bound by instructions. It was concluded in this case that even a broad interpretation of Article 55(3) GDPR would not cover this as judicial activity.

"An investigation was started on 20 December 2019 over the practices of the controller. The controller owned a platform which allowed data subjects to access their data and loyalty points and use them to benefit from promotions offered by different shops that posted their offers on the platform.

The investigation was suggested after a data leak occurred on the platform of the processor, which was notified, in accordance with Article 33 GDPR to the Belgian DPA. Nonetheless, there were suspicions that the controller did not comply with Article 32 GDPR. Especially considering the high number of data subjects, 89,429 data subjects, and the nature of the data disclosed, including the card number, e-mail address and telephone number.

The DPA held a hearing on the matter on 1 December 2023.","The DPA commented that the information provided by the controller following the data leak indicated that the controller’s practices could have been not complying with the GDPR.

In this context, the DPA affirmed that it was important to consider not only the impact of the data leak on the large number of people involved but also the nature of the data, which potentially consisted of financial data. According to the DPA, in fact, there could have been a risk for the payment details to have been leaked as well.

However, based on the information provided by the controller, the DPA noted that in the circumstances of the data leak, the incident was limited and did not impact the payment details of the data subjects. Moreover, the DPA acknowledged that the controller had also, out of prudence, informed the data subjects concerned on 22 August 2019 of the data leak so that they could take possible precautionary measures, if necessary. Thus, the controller acted in accordance with Article 33 GDPR and Article 34 GDPR. In addition, considering that the controller did not present a history of repeated data breaches indicating systematic failures on the part of the controller, it also fulfilled its obligations under Article 24 GDPR and Article 32 GDPR. Furthermore, the documents provided by the controller allowed the DPA to understand the approach adopted by the controller to avoid future data breaches, such as its commitment to review and improve future data security measures and carry out audits.

"During the police investigation against the data subject, data was copied from electronic devices in his possession, i.e. of phone and computer. After the investigation against the data subject was stopped, he sent a request to the police, and requested that the personal information stored about him be deleted and a list of those who had access to it be sent to him. The police responded that they would do so, but according to the data subject, he did not receive an answer.

The data subject complained to the DPA that the Icelandic police had kept his personal information even after an investigation against him was cancelled. Moreover, in his opinion, his requests for the deletion of the information were not answered within a reasonable time.

The DPA invited the police to respond to the complaint. The police replied that the data subject's personal data had already been deleted with the exception of 80 recordings that were found on his phone and had been specially marked as evidence. It is also said that the data subject was informed of the above by letter.

In light of the fact that the police had already agreed to the data subject's request for the deletion of the information by letter, the data subject was asked by the DPA whether there was still a dispute. The data subject replied that his complaint was based on the fact that he had to request that personal information about him, which had been irrelevant to the investigation, be deleted instead of it being deleted at the initiative of the police department. In addition, the police should have taken less time to reply to him.

The police then submitted further evidence, arguing that the data subject had requested the deletion of the information by e-mail dated 28 July 2021, and that it had been dealt with and the data subject informed by the 16 September 2021. The reason for the delay was that during the investigation of the criminal case, it was not known whether all electronic data had weight. Moreover, the summer vacation and illness of the staff affected the delivery time. In their opinion, the data was deleted as quickly as possible.

The DPA took all this information into account and made a decision.","The Icelandic DPA rejected the complaint and held that the the processing of the deletion request was in accordance with the GDPR and national law on the processing of personal information for law enforcement purposes.

First, the personal information of the data subject that was not part of the investigation of the case was deleted at the request of the prosecutor about two and a half months after the case ended. It was clear that despite the investigation ending, it was not known whether the evidence from the investigation carried weight or not and that this would delay the deletion process. It was also clear from the case file that the data subject was informed of this fact by the police. Therefore, the data would have been deleted by the police. It is not that the data subject had to motivate them to delete the data in the first place.

Second, the delays did not violate the data subject's rights. The documents that were not considered as evidence and did not become part of the relevant case were destroyed as quickly as possible.

Nonetheless, her medical certificate was handed over between departments and divisions of the city, as well as to the city attorney and from there to third parties (court-appointed appraisers).

The data subject complained that her confidentiality  had not been respected and that the city did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures","The Icelandic DPA rejected the complaint on the basis of Article 6(1)(C) GDPR as the processing was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller was subject to.

First, the assesment of her medical condition, and thus the processing of her medical certificate by the controller is a mandatory requirement under national law. In order to receive state-funded child care, it is required that a medical certificate be provided.

Second, the city attorney represents the City of Reykjavík and its institutions. His access to the medical certificate was also required by national law because due to doubts about the wording in the complainant's medical certificates, the School and Leisure Department of the City of Reykjavík requested a legal opinion from the city attorney on whether the medical certificate in question met the aforementioned conditions of the regulation on work skills.

Third, the communication by the city attorney of the complainant's personal information to her attorney and court-appointed evaluators was legally processed under Article 6(1)(f). The data subject was (at the time) party to another civil case before the courts. The parties to a civil case before the courts have a legitimate interest in its outcome. The DPA decided that the parties to the dispute must be given some leeway in assessing what personal information is necessary to work with in order to resolve the legal dispute and in what way.

The controller notified the Belgian DPA (“APD”) that the data subject’s email address had been deleted, but the data subject still received unsolicited advertising, which led to this complaint.","The APD considered that the controller was not expected to search of its own accord for a second or even multiple accounts with a similar or different email address(es) that might belong to the data subject without the identity of the data subject.

Furthermore, the APD added that in this case, there were no elements for the controller to doubt the data subject’s identity so there was no reason for the controller to request additional information to confirm its identity under Article 12(6) GDPR.

The APD therefore indicated that the controller made every effort to clarify the situation for the data subject and proceeded to remove the e-mail address as soon as it was established that the second account with another e-mail address belonged to the data subject and thus, there was no breach of Articles 12(3) and 12(4) in conjunction with Article 17(1) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 17"
"On 20 August 2020 the data subject, represented by noyb, filed a complaint against eDreams, the controller, with the Spanish DPA. The data subject stated that he visited the eDreams website, while connected to his Google account. His IP address and cookies information were collected and transferred to Google U.S. through the services of Google Analytics and Google Ads, contractualized by eDreams.

The Spanish DPA started an investigation. Based on the documents and the requests made by the Spanish DPA, it was confirmed that Google Analytics statistics were collected from stakeholders in other Member States where eDreams concentrates its activity. The data of the Google Analytics tool is accessed mainly from eDream's offices in Spain, led by the head of the Analytics team, but also from France and Germany by their country management teams in each country.

eDreams stated that they only communicate the data collected through Google Analytics to Google. In the event that the user provides their consent for advertising cookies and does not block cookies in its browser, Google Ad Manager and Google Ads tools will also be recipients of the data. The controller specified that legal basis for the incorporation of the Google Analytics tool was legitimate interest, based on the need to understand how their website is used as well as to provide a better service to users.

Concerning the international transfer of data to the U.S., the controller was using the Privacy Shield Certificate until the latter was declared invalid and subsequently the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the Commission, together with the appropriate complementary measures provided by Google. Additionally, eDreams did not have the option to opt-out from transferring data outside the EEA when using Google Analytics, since the configuration of the tool does not allow it.

The browsing and behavioral data of customers were pseudonymized by means of a cookie identifier ""Cookie ID"" that allowed eDreams to analyze how the user accessed and interacted with their website. The Cookie ID was also their internal identifier to analyze the results at a statistical level. The controller claimed that no processing of special categories of personal data took place as defined in Article 9 GDPR, nor any processing of personal data of particularly vulnerable persons. The data storage was 26 months, which allowed the controller to make comparisons with the previous year data.

On 12 October 2020, in response to the DPA’s requests, Google stated that customers using Google Analytics can enable IP anonymization immediately after the data is collected. When data collected through Google Analytics transferred by Google's customers are personal data, they would have to be pseudonymised (as mandated by Google Analytics Terms of Service). Also, Google highlighted that they obtained ISO 27001 certification and will allow customers or customer-appoint third-party auditor to conduct audits of Google Analytics and verify Google's compliance with its obligations.

Google also claimed that if any government request access to personal data stored in Google's systems in the course of an investigation, a dedicated team of Google lawyers and specially trained personnel will carefully review the request to verify that it is lawful, proportionate, and complies with Google's policies. Their infrastructure is not designed to, and does not, give the U.S. government or any other government ""backdoor"" access to customer data or its servers. In addition, they highlighted that it uses strong technical measures (such as encryption) to protect against interception, including surveillance attempts by government authorities around the world.

Despite all the arguments, on 26 July 2023, the DPA ordered eDreams to comply with Article 44 GDPR, specifically to adapt its data processing with Google Analytics to ensure no international data transfers to U.S. occur without adequate safeguards. The Spanish DPA determined the measures implemented by eDreams were insufficient to address the core issue of unlawful data transfers and the risk it posed to EU citizens' data protection rights.","eDreams contested the Resolution, leading to the appeal, based on the following arguments.

Firstly, eDreams claimed that the DPA infringed their right of defense, as the controller affected by the delay on the access to the case file. These circumstances limited their time for presenting allegations, and for not granting a requested trial period. They highlighted that further technical proof was unnecessary, since Google's terms allow data storage and processing in any country with Google facilities and all data collected via Google Analytics is hosted in the U.S. The DPA attributed the delays to technical issues and miscommunication rather than procedural fairness, and argued that the extension of deadlines to submit allegations was sufficient, countering claims of unjustified period limitation.

Secondly, eDreams contested the decision for failing to technically demonstrate international data transfers to the U.S and claimed that their privacy settings prevent such transfers. The DPA refuted these claims, stating that regardless of the eDream's ability to technically demonstrate international data transfers to the USA, these transfers have been documented and confirmed by the Terms of Use clause which allows Google to store and process citing customer personal data in any country where Google or its sub-processors have facilities, including the U.S.

Thirdly, eDreams argued that the decision did not consider the new U.S. legal framework and the European Commission's Adequacy Decision, claiming it is unfair and legally improper. The DPA disagreed, stating that the legal framework at the time of the infraction applies, and compliance with GDPR was required at the time of the complaint.

Fourthly, At the same time, eDreams contends that the imposed sanction presents an unattainable requirement. This is because EDREAMS would be compelled to administer and regulate a service that belongs to a third party (Google), and thus falls outside its sphere of control. The DPA disagrees that the decisions should be considered unattainable as it orders precise adaptation of data processing activity of the Google Analytics service with the provisions of Article 44 GDPR, in particular by ceasing the international transfer of data until it is established that the Google Analytics service complies with the GDPR provisions.

In light of the above, the DPA decided to dismiss the appeal by eDreams against the decision made on 26 July 2023, since eDreams did not provide new facts or legal arguments to reconsider the original decision.",COMPLIANT,Article 44

Regarding the alleged theft of personal data, it relied on the fact that a colleague of the data subject stated in writing that one of the defendants told the colleague that she was going to take the data subject’s file to go through it again and take any copies.

Regarding the failure to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the personnel file, it relied on the fact that in October 2022, the data subject asked for access to her file in general terms, without specifying what she was looking for. In November 2022, she clarified that she was looking for “personal reports made by her directors over the years, medical info…”. She then added that she was also looking for “medical reports as well as correspondence regarding employment” from 2020-2022. In March 2023, the data subject clarified that medical information regarding her medical absence, documentation and communication regarding her return to work and evaluation reports from 2020 were missing from the personnel file.","Concerning the failure to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the data subject’s file, firstly, the APD proceeded with a policy dismissal as they found that the data subject did not provide evidence which allowed the DPA to decide whether or not there has been a breach of the GDPR under Article 32 GDPR.  Secondly, the APD held that regarding each document, the data subject did not provide evidence that the controller was in possession of these documents. Therefore, the APD considered that the possible absence of documents from the data subject’s personnel file does not have a significant impact, as she did not demonstrate that she suffered any negative consequences after returning to the school.

Concerning the suspicions of unlawful appropriation of the data from the data subject’s personnel file, the APD proceeded to a technical dismissal as the data subject did not provide sufficient evidence to the existence of the GDPR. The only piece of evidence brought was a summary witness statement of an alleged conversation between a colleague and the controller. Since there was only talk of “taking” the file and “possibly” taking copies, the APD considered that there was no evidence that the file was effectively taken or stolen.

Therefore, the APD dismissed the complaint.",COMPLIANT,Article 32
"On 31 August 2023 the data subject received a marketing message. As he was curious to know how the controller obtained his data, he sent him a data access request, to which the controller did not reply. Therefore, the data subject filed a complaint with the Slovenian DPA.

On 18 October 2023, the controller was requested by the DPA to take a written decision on the applicant's request in accordance with Article 12 GDPR and Article 15 GDPR.

On 3 November 2023, the data controller sent an email to the DPA, indicating that they responded to the request for access to personal data and removed the data subject from the customer database.

On 8 November 2023, the data subject informed that he received a response in which the controller apologized for the delayed response. However, the apology did not change the fact that the controller missed the legally prescribed deadline, thereby violating the law and committing an offense for which a fine is prescribed.

The controller stated the data subject had voluntarily subscribed to receive notifications on 19 June 2015. In connection with this, the applicant pointed out that there were changes in data protection legislation in recent years, and controllers were required to re-obtain consent for further use or delete data. Therefore, the data subject’s claimed that retaining the data for 8 years longer and starting using the same data after a period of 8 years was unlawful and unsolicited marketing communication.

The data subject insisted on reporting the violations, believing that the controller stored and used his data without a legal basis.","The DPA acknowledged that the controller complied with the data subject’s request after the expiration of a 1-month deadline. However, the controller remedied this breach by a response to the data subject based on the DPA’s request of 18 October 2023. As a result, the DPA did not find a violation of unlawful storage of data lacking a basis according to Article 6(1) GDPR.

Regarding the allegations concerning the unlawful use of personal data for direct marketing, the DPA stated that it is not competent to take action in the area regulated by the Slovenian Electronic Communications Act which mirrors the ePrivacy Regulation.

Consequently, the DPA found no infringements on the side of the controller and the controller was not ordered to take any specific measures.",COMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 15"
"A data subject represented by noyb (European Centre for Digital Rights) complained that a website did not provide a “withdraw consent” or similar options. Therefore, noyb considered that the cookie banner infringed both the GDPR as well as the ePrivacy directive as it was not as easy to give consent as it was to withdraw it.

On 9 August 2022, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”).","On 24 August 2022, the APD visited the controller’s website and discovered that the cookie banner included an ""Accept all"" button, a “Reject all” button and a “Cookie settings” button. The APD therefore considered that the sole infringement invoked by the data subject was no longer founded. These findings were still applicable on 19 February 2024, thus, the APD decided to close the case.

Additionally, the APD also found that none of the categories of non-essential cookies were ticked by default.",COMPLIANT,Article 7
"The controller, a bank (“controller 1”), decided to block the data subject’s bank account for an overdraft of €1,400. The data subject  made an access request, asked the controller to justify its action, asked for the erasure of their personal data and explained that the debt had been transferred to a debt collecting agency (“controller 2”) and had been repaid shortly after their account had been blocked.

The data subject received no response to their telephone calls nor emails and the controller even blocked their email address. The data subject also contacted controller 2 to ask for the erasure of their personal data. Controller 2 indicated that it was able to retain the data subject’s personal data for a period of 10 years. The data subject questioned the legality of such a practice and therefore lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”) against controller 1 for not responding to the data subject access request and the erasure request and against controller 2 for not taking into account their deletion request.","Firstly, the APD considered that the complaint did not present the necessary details to assess whether there was a breach of the GDPR.

Regarding the complaint against controller 1, the APD found that the data subject submitted a copy of a single email, which does not authenticate the information provided, nor does it constitute conclusive evidence.

Regarding the complaint against controller 2, the APD held that the data subject did not provide any evidence of exchanges with the defendant concerning his erasure request.

Secondly, the APD pointed out the events took place between December 2020 and February 2021. However, the data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA in November 2023 which represents a delay of more than 2 years and 9 months since the last exchanges with the controllers. The APD also pointed out that no valid justification had been provided to explain this significant lapse of time. Therefore, the APD held that the complaint was manifestly excessive pursuant to Article 57(4) GDPR.

Thus, the APD closed the case with no further action.",COMPLIANT,Article 57
"The controller runs a website that offers news relating to fitness and sport. The website also refers to web shops of other companies where customers can buy the products presented. After pressing the button “Shop” on the British website, website visitors have the option of ordering a print editions of the articles available online to Austria. The website is not available in German.

The data subject visited the website of the controller on 24 September 2021. The website displayed a cookie banner. The data subject claimed that due to the design of the aforementioned cookie banner, several infringements had occurred and no valid consent was obtained. After visiting the website, cookies with unique, randomly generated values were set and read on the data subject’s device.

The data subject, represented by noyb, filed a complaint at the Austrian DPA (“Datenschutzbehörde”), requesting that the controller ceased all relevant processing activities and to erase all relevant personal data.

The controller argued that the GDPR did not apply as it does not consciously and intentionally offer goods and services in the EU under Article 3(2)(a) GDPR. The controller claimed it undoubtedly exclusively addresses the US market. Therefore, the controller argued that there was no reason to make extensive changes to the design of the cookie banner. The controller also claimed that it complied with the market standard and the relevant guidelines of the GDPR.

By 11 May 2023, the controller did erase all personal data of the data subject. The controller did not inform the recipients of the data transfer about the erasure of the personal data.","The DPA first examined whether the processing activities fell within the territorial scope of the GDPR under Article 3 GDPR. The territorial scope of the GDPR applies if the processing activities are related to the offering of goods (Article 3(2)(a) GDPR) or the monitoring of the behaviour of data subjects (Article 3(2)(b) GDPR).

Regarding the processing of data to offer goods or services, Recital 23 explains that the mere accessibility of the controller’s website is not a sufficient indication of the territorial scope of application. Other factors such as the use of a language commonly used in one or more Member States combined with the possibility to order goods and services in that other language may indicate that the controller intends to offer goods or services to persons in the EU. The DPA found that because the print subscription can be ordered only via a British link, it cannot be inferred that the website is aimed at a European audience, but rather that the British website has a European focus.

Regarding the behavioural observation, both Article 3(2)(b) GDPR and Recital 24 do not expressly require a necessary degree of “targeting” on the part of the controller to determine whether the monitoring activity would trigger the application of the GDPR to the processing activity. The use of the word “observation” implies that the controller pursues a specific purpose when collecting and subsequently reusing the relevant data on the behaviour of a person in the EU. According to the DPA, all forms of tracking and profiling on the internet using analysis tools are therefore covered by the GDPR, such as cookies that enable the individual traceability of users or pursue the purposes of individualised advertising (targeted advertising). Therefore, the DPA found that the processing activity of the controller did fall within the territorial scope of the GDPR, as cookies with unique, randomly generated values were set and read on the data subject’s end device as a result of visiting the website.

The DPA also held that the material scope of application of the GDPR was fulfilled as cookies that contain a unique, randomly generated value and that are set with the purpose of individualising and singling out persons entail processing of personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR.

The DPA then examined whether valid consent had been obtained by the controller for the setting or reading of cookies. There was no possibility at the first level of the cookie banner to reject consent or to enter the website without giving consent. The banner only had the option to refuse consent on the second level after clicking “LEARN MORE” at the first level. Taking into account the CJEU case C-252/21, a procedure, in which data subjects are required to carry out more interactions for not giving consent than for giving consent, cannot comply with the principle of fair processing pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The DPA held that both “Accept” and “Reject” option should be visible at the first level. The DPA therefore found that no unambiguous expression of consent pursuant to Article 4(11) GDPR had occurred and thus, the cookie banner did not comply with the requirements of the GDPR. The DPA ordered the controller to modify the cookie banner in such a way that a valid consent is obtained when visiting the website.

Moreover, the DPA held that the cookie banner itself did not contain a simple and clear notice explaining where consent can be withdrawn. The DPA therefore ordered the controller to adapt its website in such a way that the revocation of consent for cookies used and the associated processing of personal data is easily possible.

The DPA further explained that the use of cookies which are not technically necessary for the use of a website requires prior consent. The controller’s use of analytics cookies cannot in any case be considered technically necessary cookies. Therefore, the DPA ordered the controller should adapt its website accordingly to ensure that prior consent is obtained for the use of such analysis cookies and the associated data processing.

As no valid consent was obtained, the controller was obligated to erase the data in accordance with Article 17(1)(d) GDPR. The controller did not store the personal data of the data subject at the time of the DPA’s examination of the complaint, because it had already erased the data. Therefore, the DPA held there was no violation of Article 17 GDPR.

The controller was obliged to inform the recipients about the erasure of data pursuant to Article 19 GDPR. The controller did not provide the DPA with evidence proving compliance with the notification obligation in Article 19 GDPR, even though the controller bears the burden of proof under Article 5(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 24(1) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 4, Article 5, Article 17, Article 19, Article 77"
"The data subject is an Austrian artist who is known to a wider public in Austria through his work as a filmmaker, screenwriter and cameraman.

The controller, Wikimedia Foundation Inc, is the operator of Wikipedia.org.

The data subject requested the controller to erase all his data under Article 17 GDPR, because the data was inaccurate and not up to date. The registered films were not up to date and there were also errors with certain films, in which he was either not correctly listed or the films had incorrect titles.

The controller refused the erasure request based on two reasons. Firstly, the controller claimed that it did not fall under the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3 GDPR) as it was based exclusively in the USA and under US law, and thus the GDPR is not applicable. It also did not provide any goods or services to persons such as the data subject. Secondly, the data processing was lawful due to the legitimate interest of the public as the data subject is a public figure and the processing was carried out for journalistic purposes. Even if the GDPR was applicable, the controller claimed that the data subject would not be entitled to erasure because the media privilege would apply.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA (Datenschutzbehörde, DSB), claiming that data processed by the controller was not factually accurate or up to date. The principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) GDPR obliges the controller to ensure that the data is both factually correct and, if necessary, up to date.","Regarding the applicability of the GDPR, the DPA found that, although the controller was based in the USA, it had a total of 38 national branch associations with at least one of them located in Austria. There was also an automatic redirection (after entering a search term) from ""http://wikipedia.at"" to ""https://de.wikipedia.org"", which clearly showed the close links between the controller’s (branch) associations and the controller itself and the aim of facilitating access for Austrian users. Moreover, the article of the data subject was only available in English and German. Thus, the information service about the data subject is obviously aimed at the German-speaking area and not only at the US.  The controller obviously intended to attract Austrian users to its information service, thus fulfilling the requirement under Article 3(2)(a) GDPR. The DPA therefore held that the material and territorial scope of application were met and thus, the GDPR is applicable.

The DPA also held that the controller must at least be qualified as a joint controller with its users under Article 4(7) GDPR as the controller was responsible for raising funds, controlling the servers, developing the software and public relations work to support all its projects and its website and intervene directly in cases where swift action is required.

Regarding the controller’s claim they have media privilege, Article 85 GDPR allows for Member States to provide for exemptions for processing carried out for journalistic purposes to the purpose of academic artistic or literary expression. According to the DPA’s established national practice, two conditions must be met cumulatively for the media privilege to apply:

1. Personal data must be processed by the media owner, publisher, media employees and employees of a media organisation or media service within the meaning of the Austrian Media Act;
2. this processing must be for journalistic purposes of the media organisation or media service.

Since the person who is ultimately responsible for the content and editing of the content distributed via the network is understood to be the media owner, the DPA found that in this case the controller was not involved in the content design and cannot be qualified as a media owner. Therefore, the first condition was not met and media privilege did not apply and the DPA was responsible for handling the complaint.

Regarding the inaccuracy of data, the DPA found that the film titles were correct and thus no inaccuracy could be established. On the not up to date data, the DPA explained that the controller's legal obligation to complete the data only exists in those cases in which the added information is actually relevant to the processing of data in order to ensure the objective accuracy of the data. The purpose of the processing by the controller in this case is to provide general information about the data subject for users of the website. The DPA found that it does not mean that all works in which the data subject has participated needs to be listed exhaustively. Merely an overview of the filmography is sufficient to fulfill the processing purpose. Therefore, the DPA held that the processing purpose within the meaning of Article 5(1)(d) GDPR had not been violated.

Regarding the data subject’s right to erasure, the DPA explained that there is an exception under Article 17(3)(a) GDPR if the processing is necessary for exercising the right to freedom of expression and information. This is not absolute and must be weighed against the fundamental rights in the Charter. Because the data subject was a public figure who is known to a broad public and the data could not be qualified as false, untrue or inaccurate, the intensity of the interference was classified by the DPA as low. Therefore, the DPA held that the legitimate interests of the general public pursuant to Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in access to information outweigh the flawed legitimate interests of the data subject. Thus, the exception of Article 17(3)(a) GDPR applies and therefore the DPA found that the controller correctly did not comply with the data subject’s request.",COMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 4, Article 5, Article 17, Article 85"
"The data subject requested access from the controller, the Swedish branch of the Nordea Bank. The data subject requested a recording of a conversation between one of the controller’s employees and the data subject himself. The data subject only received a copy of the conversation without the voice of the controller’s employee.

The data subject filed a complaint at the Swedish DPA (Integritetsskydds myndigheten, IMY) for a violation of the right of access under Article 15 GDPR as the data subject did not receive a copy of the conversation that included the voice of the controller’s employee.

The controller argued that it had complied with the request by allowing the data subject to listen to the recording on site at the controller’s branch. The data subject had also been offered a transcript of the phone conversation and a copy of the audio file with the recording in which the controller’s employee’s voice had been edited out.","According to the DPA, the right of access under Article 15 GDPR implies that the controller is obliged to provide a data subject with the requested copy of the processed personal data. However, the DPA notes that this right to a copy must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. The DPA explains that the purpose of the right of access is to ensure that the data subject is aware that the processing is taking place and can verify its lawfulness. The right to obtain a copy of personal data includes a right for the data subject to obtain an accurate and intelligible reproduction of all personal data that the controller processes about them.

The DPA held that the data subject’s voice in the telephone conversation is personal data of the data subject and thus the data subject is entitled to receive a copy of this telephone conversation. However, the DPA also held that the voice of the controller's employee does not constitute personal data concerning the data subject. Therefore, a transcript of the telephone conversation is sufficient according to the DPA.

The DPA concluded that the controller satisfied the data subject’s request for access and therefore rejected the complaint.",COMPLIANT,Article 15
"On 13 October 2023, the data subject submitted a request for access and subsequent erasure of his personal data, as he feared a “major negative personal impact” in the form of defamation. The controller responded that it would not act on the data erasure request because (i) the data subject had given consent to the processing of this personal data in a prior agreement and (ii) the controller needed to retain the personal data due to an overriding public interest.

On 30 December 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”). On 23 February 2024, the APD asked the controller to clarify 3 points: firstly, the APD asked the controller on what exception they relied on to refuse to grant the data subject access to his personal data. The controller explained that it had not allowed access to the document as it could pose a possible threat to the privacy of others, partly because a file against the data subject was opened by the police in June 2023.

Secondly, the APD asked clarifications regarding the “prior agreement” the controller relied on to refuse the access and erasure requests. The controller responded that the data subject signed a privacy notice.

Thirdly, the APD asked additional information concerning the “substantial public interest” that the controller relied on. The controller explained that the data subject was accused of criminal offences in which the controller could contribute evidence for the benefit of the public interest.

In its responses, the controller also indicated that it was willing to give the data subject access to the file, and that it would make the necessary practical arrangements to this end.","Regarding the failure to respond to the access request, the APD considered that although the controller did not respond to access request submitted in October 2023, the controller expressed its willingness to grant inspection to the data subject in its reply in March 2024.

Regarding the failure to erase the data on compelling public interest grounds, the APD considered that the complaint was manifestly unfounded as the right to erasure does not apply when processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims pursuant to Article 17(3)(e) GDPR. The APD therefore considered it sufficient that there could be a “possible” legal action in the future to justify not deleting the data subject’s data under Article 17(3)(e) GDPR. The APD also insisted on the fact that the controller must ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the personal data, under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

Thus, the APD decided to dismiss the complaint.",COMPLIANT,Article 17
"Data subject one is an ambassador of a government and worked for the controller. Data subject two is married to data subject one.

The controller is an international organisation, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

The controller initiated an internal investigation against data subject one after a sexual harassment and discrimination complaint about them by a former employee of the controller. Data subject one argued the allegations were not true. During the internal investigation, Whatsapp and Telegram messages between the data subjects were disclosed, which did not reveal any harassing or discriminatory behaviour. The work phone of data subject one was also confiscated during the investigation without their consent.

As part of the investigation, a large amount of content of the first complainant's work mobile phone was extracted and analysed. Content that had already been deleted had also been restored. Although the employee's allegations had not been confirmed, data subject one had been informed that the extracted or deleted and restored photos contained both nudity and pornographic content and that therefore proceedings would be initiated against them for violation of the controller’s code of conduct.

The extracted data largely concerned the private and family life of data subject one. The health data of data subject one’s parents had also been revealed during the investigation. Therefore, data subject one requested the erasure of the unlawfully obtained data and to indicate which personal data had been obtained and which recipients the personal data was disclosed to.

The controller replied that it would not comply with the two requests due to its immunity.

The data subjects filed a complaint at the Austrian DPA (“Datenschutzbehörde”). The data subjects claimed there was a violation of their right to confidentiality as the controller analysed the work phone of data subject one on which (sensitive) personal data of the data subjects were stored. The data subjects argued that not only the professional data had been analysed, but also the private content, which had also been labelled as such. They argued there was no legal basis for this. The data subjects further argued that their right to access was violated, because they were not informed of the recipients who received their personal data. The data subjects further argued that their right to erasure was violated.","The DPA first examined whether they were competent to decide on the matter. The DPA explained that under Article 4(7) GDPR, international organisations are not excluded from being defined as a controller. The DPA held that the criterion of the territorial scope under Article 3 GDPR was also fulfilled, as the controller had an official seat in Vienna. In general, the material scope under Article 2(1) GDPR would also apply as the DPA found that automated data processing took place.

Moreover, the DPA found that there was an agreement in place between the Republic of Austria and the controller which regulated the legal status and immunities of the controller (see the Headquarters Agreement). Although international organisations do not enjoy complete immunity from their actions in the host state, the DPA only has jurisdiction if this is provided for or not explicitly denied by a headquarters agreement. The Headquarters Agreement between the controller and the Republic of Austria provided that the laws of Austria (and thus also the GDPR) shall apply to the controller, unless the controller had established their own specific regulation (see Article 5(6)(a) of the Headquarters Agreement). The DPA found that the controller had relevant internal regulations in place for the protection of personal data (the ""OSCE Personal Data Protection Administrative Instruction No. 2/2022""), which included a right to appeal and a possibility to be granted legal protection. Therefore, the GDPR did not apply in material terms and thus, the DPA held that the right to lodge a complaint with the DPA must be denied.

The DPA did note that the controller’s internal regulations regarding the protection of personal data are not comparable to the GDPR in terms of scope and, in particular, the possibility of legal protection. The DPA noted that the data subject’s constitutionally guaranteed rights may have been violated by the controller’s regulations. However, the DPA held that it could not examine whether these regulations were unconstitutional for this reason, as this was exclusively a matter for the Constitutional Court pursuant to Austrian national law (see Article 140a B-VG).

Therefore, the DPA dismissed the complaint.",COMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 3, Article 4"
"On 10 May 2019, the data subject consented to the processing of his personal data for the use of captured image in activities and interviews to be published in Gabinete de Neurociencias S.L.'s (the controller) social networks and websites to disseminate the sporting activities.

On 7 February 2023, the data subject exercised his right of objection and withdrew his consent for the use of his personal images, claiming that on 30 March 2023, his images still appeared in the claimed company social media.

The controller argued that they attempted to address the request appropriately and that technical and communication issues with Meta (the company behind the social networks used) prevented the timely deletion of the image. Despite their efforts, including multiple attempts to contact and requests for assistance from META, the corporate account in question could not be recovered or modified in time.

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) dismissed the complaint because the data controller did respond to the data subject’s request, complying with the applicable deadlines stipulated by GDPR. It found that the completeness of the request depends on META’s return.

The data subject filed an appeal. The data controller reiterated their documented attempts and efforts to delete the images and communicate with Meta, arguing that despite their efforts they faced issues in fully complying with the erasure request due to Meta's nonresponsiveness.","The AEPD dismissed the appeal by the data subject. It found that the data controller had responded to the erasure request and was not able to fully address the request due to technical problems with Meta.

"The Finnish DPA was notified that a company (""controller"") had refused to erase the data subject's personal data relating to their recruitment process. The DPA then asked the controller to explain why it had refused the erasure request and for how long it stored the personal data of its job applicants.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it could not comply with the data subject's request because the processing was necessary according to Article 17(3)(b) GDPR and Article 17(3)(e) GDPR. The controller stated that, according to Chapter 8 Section 1(2)(4) of the Finnish Criminal Code, a work discrimination claim must be filed within two years. Therefore, the controller could not erase the personal data because two years had not passed since the end of the recruitment process.

The controller also stated that it continued to process the job applicants' personal data for six months after the end of the two-year statute of limitations as a precautionary measure in order to be able to deal with discrimination claims if they were filed at the very end of the statute of limitations.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the controller was entitled to store the data subject's personal data for two years after the end of the recruitment process. The DPA stated that if the controller deleted the data subject's personal data, it would not be able to defend itself against possible discrimination claims.

The DPA noted that according to Chapter 8 Section 2(1) of the Finnish Criminal Code, the statute of limitations is calculated from the date when the offense is committed. In light of this, the DPA emphasised that it is not the date when the claim was filed that is relevant, but the date when the work discrimination took place. Thus, the DPA found that the controller could not store the personal data for more than two years.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller did not have to comply with the data subject's request to erase the personal data in question pursuant to Article 17(3)(b) GDPR and Article 17(3)(e) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,Article 17
"A bank ('controller') used the data subject's personal data, including the content of payment transactions, to build models for their 'personalised discounts' service. The data subject objected to the use of his data to build models which offered the personalised discounts. The controller responded that his request was registered and that his data would no longer be used for model building. The data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA ('GBA') on 10 January 2020.

First, the  controller argued that it relied on consent for the activation of the personalised discounts service. However, to build the models on which the service is based, the controller invoked legitimate interest. It also explained that building these models constitutes further processing. Therefore, the controller distinguished between 'tailored information' which was based on the data subject's consent which he could withdraw and the 'model building', which was based on legitimate interest with the data subject's right to object.

Second, the controller argued that the data subject did not have an interest in the case as he never activated the personalised discounts service. The controller also explained that the data subject's right to objection was granted before the complaint was filed and thus, his personal data was no longer processed for the model building. The controller considered that this rendered the complaint inadmissible.

The data subject argued that the processing of personal data in data models was done for a completely different purpose than that for which the personal data was initially collected, namely the handling of transactions in the performance of the agreement between the controller and the data subject. The data subject also explained that the controller's privacy policy of 2 February 2017 stated that the controller used its customers' transaction data to better know and serve its customers for all marketing and commercial purposes as listed in the privacy policy. The controller updated its privacy policy on 1 February 2019 and it indicated that the transaction data was used to build analytical data models for commercial purposes.","First, the DPA analysed the data subject's interest in lodging a complaint. The GBA pointed out that the GDPR does not prevent a national law from allowing persons other than data subjects to lodge a complaint with DPAs. In accordance with this, Belgian national law allows any person to file a complaint, provided they have a sufficient interest in doing so.

In the present case, the GBA held that the subject of the complaint was the use of the data subject's personal data by the controller to build and train the models which the personalised discounts service was based on. Following the data subject's exercise of his right to object to the processing, the models were modified. Therefore, the current models were no longer based on the data subject's personal data.

However, the GBA considered that this was completely irrelevant: the mere fact that the data subject's personal data was no longer included in the dataset on which the models were based and trained did not mean that the data subject had no interest in filing the complaint. The GBA pointed out that it could not be denied that the data subject's personal data was indeed processed. Thus, the data subject had an interest in challenging the legal basis for such data processing.

Second, regarding the purpose, the GBA confirmed that the processing of personal data for building data models constitutes processing for a new purpose than that of targeting data subjects with personalised discounts. The GBA also pointed out that this purpose was not disclosed to customers, including the data subject, at the time of entering into the customer relationship. With regard to what was claimed by the controller in its privacy policy, the DPA considered that this processing constituted a new purpose distinct form the initial purpose of executing and recording payments.

Concerning the further processing, the GBA assessed whether or not this new purpose could be considered compatible with the initial purpose. Article 5(1)(b) GDPR establishes that processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which they were initially collected may be authorised if the processing is compatible with the purposes for which they were initially collected. In the present case, the GBA considered that when the data subject entrusted his personal and transaction data to the controller, he had no reasonable expectation that the controller would use the same data to build models that offer personalised discounts. Moreover, the DPA held that the purpose pursued by the controller was not  motivated by scientific, historical or statistical considerations. The end goal was purely commercial. As such, the GBA concluded that the controller could not benefit from this exception and that there was no compatible further processing.

Concerning the legal basis, the DPA examined the possibility of invoking legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis. This article establishes that the processing of personal data is lawful if it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject prevail. Recital 47 GDPR states that the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest. In CJEU, 4 May 2017, Rigas, C-13/16, the Court of Justice held that Article 6(1)(f) GDPR lays down three cumulative conditions: (i) the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the controller, (ii) the necessity of the processing in order to achieve the legitimate interest pursued and (iii) the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject must not prevail.

Regarding the pursuit of a legitimate interest, the GBA considered that building models in order to offer personalised discounts to the controller's customers should be considered as carried out with a legitimate interest in mind. The DPA noted that building a data model aimed at offering personalised discounts was part of the controller positioning itself in the market. The controller's starting point was to gain insight into its customers' services while responding to societal evolutions and trends such as digitisation and personalisation of services and diversification of service. The GBA considered that this may be a legitimate interest.

Regarding the necessity of the processing in order to achieve the legitimate interest, the GBA pointed out that the analysis of transaction data to train models is necessary to provide personalised discounts to the controller's customers. Indeed, without the creation of data models, the discounts could not be offered in a personalised manner through a digital application. Therefore, the GBA considered that this processing was necessary to achieve the legitimate interest.

Regrading balancing between the interests of the controller and the freedoms and rights of the data subject, the GBA held that the reasonable expectations of the data subject should be taken into account. This is also emphasised by CJEU, 11 December 2019, C-708/18, TK v Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, in which the CJEU found that ""the data subject’s reasonable expectations that his or her personal data will not be processed when, in the circumstance of the case, that person cannot reasonably expect further processing of those data, are also relevant for the purposes of the balancing exercise."" The GBA considered that it was essential to distinguish between the phase of building and training the models themselves, and the phase of offering personalised discounts through the use of the models built in the previous phase.

The GBA found that it was within the data subject's normal expectation that the controller used its transaction data to train models, without further operationally using them to offer personalised discounts for which consent was sought. The controller removed identifiers and did not apply the model to identify individuals, nor to re-identify them. The GBA also held that the models were merely algorithms that no longer contained personal data. The DPA also took into account the fact that the customers' personal data was not passed on to third parties and no special categories of data were processed by the models. Therefore, the GBA concluded that the impact on the data subject was extremely small and the processing of his personal data was kept to a minimum as it did not give rise to the offering of personalised discounts without the data subject's consent. The GBA also pointed out that the data subject could always exercise his right to object to the use of his data to build models within the meaning of Article 21 GDPR.

Therefore, the GBA concluded that there was a legitimate interest of the controller related to the processing, - namely building data models, aimed at offering personalised services – being an element of positioning itself in the market – a commercial interest of the controller.

Additionally, the GBA pointed out that the controller complied with the transparency obligation by not only updating its privacy policy, but by also informing its customers directly. The data subject was also made aware of the possibility of exercising his right to object, which he did, and the controller responded appropriately.

Therefore, the GBA concluded that the controller complied with its obligations under and did not commit any breach of the GDPR as regards to the construction of the data models.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"On 20 March 2021, an incident occurred in traffic between the complainant (the data subject) and an individual (the reporter), who subsequently filed a complaint at the police station. On 28 September 2021, the complainant inspected the complaint and the associated police file after being informed that the proceedings had been discontinued. The complainant discovered that the reporter knew their name at the time of filing the complaint. As a result, the data subject submitted a (data protection) complaint to the relevant data protection authority (DPA) on 23 October 2021. They alleged a violation of the right to secrecy under § 1 Datenschutzgesetz (Data Protection Act) (DSG) by the police officer involved in their case. On 21 September 2022, the DPA handling the case issued a decision, dismissing the complainant's data protection complaint against the police officer on the grounds that the police officer did not have controller status within the meaning of Article 4(7) Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (General Data Protection Regulation) (GDPR).  Following the dismissal, the complainant lodged a new data protection complaint against the police officer involved in a letter dated 09 October 2022. Upon the request of the DPA, the data subject provided a statement that they became aware of the violation of the right to secrecy in December 2021 based on subsequent inquiries. Therefore, they argued that their new complaint filed in October 2022 was timely. On 30 January 2023, the authorities alleged that the data subject made contradictory statements regarding their knowledge of the alleged violation. On 06 February 2023, the complainant responded that there was no contradiction and provided an explanation. The data subject made further submissions on 28 March 2023, highlighting that their new complaint was not identical to the first complaint because the responsible person had changed. They argued that the concept of the ‘responsible person’ should be defined and interpreted broadly to allow complainants to make mistakes in identifying responsible individuals without invalidating their complaints. The data subject further reiterated that their second complaint was timely, and was proven. On 19 May 2023, the authorities rejected the complainant's data protection complaint filed on 09 October 2022. The authority argued that the complainant's request to address the data protection complaint had expired as the one-year limitation period from the date of knowledge of the adverse event had already lapsed, as stipulated in § 24(4) (DSG). The complainant was aware of the adverse event on 28 September 2021, as exemplified in their own statements. However, the complaint was only lodged on 10 October 2022.","The Court held that the deadlines specified in §24 DSG are preclusive deadlines, which must be considered ex officio if the facts are established without objection. It emphasised that the fact that the current data protection complaint filed (on 09 October 2022) targeted the same alleged data protection violation by the officer on 20 March 2021, and was directed at another respondent, did not matter. The subjective deadline of one year under § 24(4) DSG had already expired with respect to the data protection issue in question. The complainant did not lodge the said complaint within one year of becoming aware of the alleged offending event, which resulted in the expiration of the right to complaint handling in accordance with § 24(4) DSG. The Court also argued that these deadlines do not disproportionately restrict the right to lodge a complaint under Article 77 GDPR.  Moreover, § 68(1) Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz (General Administrative Procedure Act)  (AVG) has the purpose of preventing the reexamination of a previously resolved matter. In accordance with said provision, the reconsideration of a matter that was already legally decided based on the complainant's initial data protection complaint from 23 October 2021, and the decision made by the DPA, is not allowed. Therefore, the filing of a data protection complaint was no longer permissible and the DPA was justified in refusing to deal with the content of the data protection complaint and rejecting it in the contested decision. The legality of the authority’s decision on 21 September 2022 could therefore not be questioned in these proceedings.  Since the contested decision was held to be legal as stipulated in Article 130 paragraph 1 Z 1 Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz (Federal Constitutional Law)(B-VG), the decision upheld the verdict.",COMPLIANT,Article 4
"A data subject exercised their right of access with the administrator of the software platform for an app and website (‘administrator’). This app and website allowed patients to browse medical practices, identify themselves, choose the doctor with whom they want the appointment, choose the desired time slot and confirm the appointment.

The administrator of the platform indicated that they were merely acting as a processor and processing personal data on behalf of the health providers. It also provided the data subject with a list of doctors with whom the data subject is in the database.

The data subject considered this response insufficient and claimed that the administrator was indeed responsible for the processing. They therefore lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA ('GBA').","Firstly, regarding controllership, the GBA indicated that the GDPR defines a 'controller' as the person who determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The DPA added that the CJEU held that the concept of ‘controller’ should be interpreted broadly (CJEU, 10 July 2018, Jehovan todistajat, C-25/17).

Additionally, the EDPB Guidelines on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR indicate that the controller is not necessarily someone who actually has access to the data being processed. For example, someone who outsources a processing activity and has a determinative influence on the purpose and essential means of the processing is to be regarded as a controller (§45 of the EDPB Guidelines).

In the present case, the GBA found that the purpose of the app and website was to have an online scheduling system, exchange data with other apps and make fully automated appointments. Therefore, the purpose was determined autonomously by the healthcare provider. The administrator simply provided an online calendar system to achieve this purpose. Therefore, the healthcare providers were considered controllers.

The GBA then noted that to be considered a processor within the meaning of the GDPR, two central conditions must be met: (i) it must be a natural or legal person and (ii) it must process personal data on behalf of the controller.

Regarding the first condition, the GBA held that the healthcare providers decided to outsource the activity consisting of online registration of patient appointments to the administrator of the platform which is an external organisation, separate from the healthcare providers practice. Therefore, the administrator had a legal personality.

Regarding the second condition, the GBA noted that the processing agreements showed that the processing activity was carried out exclusively according to the written instructions of the healthcare providers. They also expressly provided that the administrator would not process personal data for any purpose other those specified by the healthcare provider. The privacy policy also specified that the administrator was only responsible for the technical functioning of the platform, while the healthcare providers were responsible for determining the purpose and content of the processing operations.

Therefore, the GBA held that the administrator was in fact a processor.

Secondly, regarding the right of access, the GBA pointed out that the rights available to the data subject must be exercised vis-à-vis the controller. It indicated that no provision of the GDPR provides a basis for the data subject to exercise their right of access directly with the processor.

In the present case, the processor repeatedly attempted to provide information to the data subject explaining that their access request should be addressed to each healthcare provider. The DPA also noted that the administrator even informed them of the databases of healthcare providers in which they could be found, which was a good practice and facilitated the exercise of the data subject's rights.

Therefore, the GBA concluded that there was no violation of Article 4(7) GDPR, read in conjunction with Articles 12(3), 12(4) and 15(1) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 12, Article 15"
"A bank’s employee, an ex-girlfriend of data subject, allegedly consulted data subject's personal data for one and a half of a year.

The data subject contacted the bank (controller) twice, claiming that the controller’s employee (his ex-girlfriend) breached the confidentiality of the data, as she consulted the data outside controller's instructions, namely to stalk the data subject. Also, the data subject asked about the measures taken by the controller against the employee.

Later on, the data subject decided to file a complaint with the police against his ex-girlfriend on charge of stalking.

In response, the controller explained that the employee processed the data subject's data outside of her professional capacity and without controller's instruction. Additionally, the controller, implemented necessary and proportionate measures, as well as reported the breach with the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA).

The data subject did not share the views of the controller and, consequently, filed a complaint with the DPA and the National Ombudsman (Nationale ombudsman), claiming a breach of confidentiality by the controller.","The DPA dismissed the data subject's complaint.

Firstly, the actions taken by the controller after data subject’s notification were sufficient in the situation at hand. The controller implemented measures which adequately dealt with the breach of confidentiality. As a result, the DPA found no evidence that the measures were ineffective, especially they did not stop the employee from further unlawful conduct. At the same time, the controller acted proactively, preventing similar breaches to occur in the future. Therefore, the subject matter of the case was obsolete.

Secondly, the DPA stated the complaint brought by the data subject also covered the criminal offence of stalking. However, the DPA had no jurisdiction over criminal cases of that kind, which made this part of compliant inadmissible.",COMPLIANT,Article 32
"On 15.12.2022 the complainant proceeded to file a complaint against a Diagnostic centre. The complainant alleged that after conducting tests at the diagnostic centre, an employee of the diagnostic centre communicated the results of her tests to the complainant's father by telephone without her consent. Specifically, she alleged that an employee of the diagnostic center contacted her father by telephone, informed him of the additional tests that the complainant had to undergo and requested that the complainant call immediately to confirm the additional cost. In the complainant's protest, she claimed that the diagnostic center apologized and admitted the incident by saying ""what's done is done, now it's not undone.""

On 28.03.2023, the respondent diagnostic centre replied to the Authority as follows: it confirmed that the complainant had undergone examinations at the diagnostic centre, where the secretariat informed her about the data protection policy of the complainant and completed the form E3 entitled ""DECLARATION OF CONSENT FOR SENDING RESULTS"" for sending the results by electronic mail using the encryption method. Furthermore, according to the diagnostic center's allegations, the complainant herself provided her telephone number to the secretariat, which was registered in the system, and the secretariat called that telephone number in order to inform her of additional required tests. This call was answered by the complainant's father, who responded that the complainant was absent and who was asked to inform her that she needed to contact the diagnostic center for her personal matter and no health information was disclosed. Furthermore, with regard to the center's apology, the respondent claimed that there was no admission of the incident and apology, but rather the situation was handled with courtesy and the complainant was informed of the content of the disputed telephone call.

On 28.04.2023, the complainant responded to the allegations of the respondent and noted that she never stated the specific telephone number to the diagnostic centre and that her number is different and she stands by the allegations of her complaint. In response, the respondent clarifies that the complainant's father is not a client of the diagnostic centre and therefore it is impossible that he could have been called in error, insisting on the allegation that the specific telephone number was verbally stated by the complainant and entered into the diagnostic centre's system. At the same time, it submits that the complaint is unproven, unfounded and constitutes an attempt by the complainant to obtain a pecuniary advantage, which has submitted an extrajudicial statement to the company proposing an out-of-court settlement of the incident in return for compensation.","On 25.01.2024, the Hellenic DPA summoned the complainant and the respondent to a hearing before the President of the Authority as a single representative body. During the hearing, they presented their allegations and were given a deadline to respond. The complainant reiterated her allegations, stressing in particular that she had never given her father's mobile phone number herself and that the secretariat of the diagnostic centre had disclosed sensitive health data during the call to her father, who, according to her, was a client of the diagnostic centre and that the call to him had been made by mistake by the secretariat. The respondent argued that the contact details were updated with the patients' verbal declaration to the registry and that the complainant's health data had never been disclosed to her father, as the registrars did not have access to the test results in any case. Furthermore, they expressed the view that the complaint in question had been lodged as a mean of enriching in relation to the out-of-court settlement she was seeking. With regard to the security measures taken by the diagnostic centre, the respondent informed that it had already been decided to rely on the procedures followed by the centre, in which the patients themselves record their communication details on a tablet during their visit.

The Authority, having examined all the information in the file and the allegations made by the complainant and the respondent, considered that the content of the telephone call could not be established with certainty and that no leakage of personal data could be established, given that, as the evidence showed, the diagnostic center's secretariat did not have access to the patients' test results and their health data. It also assessed the updating of the diagnostic centre's procedures by having the patients' communication forms signed by the diagnostic centre via a tablet.

Therefore, it is not established that the respondent has violated the principle of confidentiality of the complainant's data, while it is clear that the Diagnostic center has acted in accordance with the provisions of Articles 32 and 24(2) GDPR. The Authority therefore rejected the complaint as unfounded.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32"
"The data subject owned a flat and was a member of the co-owners’ association. Following multiple incidents, several co-owners requested the installation of a security system with cameras in the entrance hall and garage. In January 2018, a general meeting was held and the installation was unanimously approved, not including the abstention of some owners, including the data subject. In 2018, the cameras were installed, and sticker icons were placed to indicate that the building was surveilled. The data subject allegedly removed these stickers because they were bilingual and they claimed that this was not allowed. The data subject also allegedly cut several signal cables and threatened the installer of the cameras.

In July 2019, the data allegedly rendered one of the cameras unusable using an alcohol marker. Additionally, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (‘APD’) against the installer of the cameras and the representative of the co-owners’ association for installing the cameras without the data subject’s consent, and claiming that the images were kept in an unknown location for an unknown duration.

The aforementioned incident and the complaint made the representative disable the cameras. Therefore, since July 2019, the cameras had allegedly stopped filming. The representative also argued that the decision to install cameras was taken by a vote and not individually. Additionally, there was a 4-month appeal period against the decision. The data subject did not challenge the decision, which made it binding under Article 557-9 of the Belgian Civil Code.

In July 2020, August 2020, May 2021, December 2022 and February 2022, the data subject inquired about the progress of the case and urged that the complaint be dealt with promptly.","First, the DPA explained that due to a lack of shifts in the staffing of the Disputes Chamber of the DPA, insufficient progress was made on this case. Due to the complexity of the case, the APD decided not to include this case in the ""Tabula Rasa"" of May 2023, a document in which it dismissed a large number of cases at once.

Second, the DPA found that the complaint was an ancillary dispute to a broader dispute for which other courts, tribunals or jurisdictions have jurisdiction, pursuant to the APD’s dismissal policy. Indeed, the dispute concerned, in particular, neighbor quarrels, vandalism, threats and language used in camera pictograms.

Therefore, the APD considered that its intervention in the dispute was not strictly necessary nor did it have visibility over most elements of the dispute. Therefore, the APD dismissed the case.",COMPLIANT,Article 6
"On 5 March 2024 a data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA against a website owner (‘controller’) who published an article in which they disclosed the data subject’s personal data. The personal data disclosed included the data subject’s religious beliefs.

In addition to that, the controller also published the applicant’s personal data in the newsletter and refused to withdraw this publication despite the data subject’s request for erasure. This was justified by the freedom of speech of the press.

The data subject claimed that they did not consent to this data processing neither was provided a prior notice concerning the disclosure.","The DPA rejected the data subject’s claim.

As an introduction, the DPA recalled Article 39(1) of the Constitute of the Republic of Slovenia which guarantees freedom of thought, speech and public speaking of the press and other forms of public information and expression. Like the right to the protection of personal data under Article 38 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia, the right to freedom of expression is not unlimited.

The DPA confirmed that the controller is a media broadcaster under the Slovenian Media Act. Article 6 Media Act provides that the activities of the media shall be based on freedom of expression as stipulated by the Constitution. According to the DPA, the publication in question is clearly a reflection of that right.

Additionally, freedom of expression shall be ensured also in the exercise of rights of data subjects in the context of personal data processed under Article 73 of the Slovenian Data Protection Law (‘ZVOP 2’).

In particular, the determination of the right to erasure Article 17 GDPR in cases where personal data are processed in the exercise of the freedom of thought, speech and public expression of the press is not an administrative matter. In fact, according to the DPA, this case shall be dealt with by courts.

Therefore, the DPA decided to reject the claim as it is not an administrative matter, neither within its competence.",COMPLIANT,"Article 17, Article 85"
"In August 2020, a data subject visited a news website, 24.hu (the controller), while being logged into their Facebook. The data subject observed that the controller processed her personal data (IP address and cookie settings) using a Facebook Connect cookie and transferred at least some of it to Facebook, Inc. (the processor) – i.e., to the United States (US). Represented by noyb, the European Centre for Digital Rights, the data subject filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA (NAIH) claiming that the controller unlawfully transferred her data to a third country.

The data subject argued that the transfer of personal data to the US was an unlawful breach of the GDPR given Schrems II, which invalidated the adequacy decision for data transfers between the EU-U.S. (Privacy Shield). In addition, the transfer could not be based on the standard data protection clauses set out in Article 46(2)(c) and (d) GDPR pursuant to Schrems I. Because the controller was thus unable to adequately guarantee the protection of the personal data transferred, the data subject argued, it should be legally obliged to stop the transfer of personal data to the United States. Nonetheless, almost 1 month after the Schrems II judgment, the controller had not taken any action to stop the transfer. The data subject requested a full investigation by the DPA pursuant to Article 58(1) GDPR, as well as a suspension of the transfer pursuant to Article 58(2)(d), (f) and (j) GDPR.

The NAIH launched an inquiry. It determined that the data subject’s IP address, unique user cookie and context of visit (URL) were processed by the processor. It also noted that the controller’s data processing terms and Privacy Shield Terms continued to refer to the EU-US Privacy Shield despite its invalidation. In addition, the privacy policy did not mention recipients of personal data processed by the controller.

In a reply brief submitted on 7 January 2021, the controller stated that it was not aware of personal data processed by external organizations like Facebook. The controller acknowledged that several cookies transferred data to the US, but that the Facebook Connect cookie in particular transferred data to Ireland rather than to a third country.  It claimed that consent was its legal basis for processing.","The NAIH concluded that the transfer of personal data had no legal basis given the controller's reliance on the invalidated EU-US Privacy Shield. It also noted that the controller had violated Article 28(1) GDPR by failing to use processors providing sufficient guarantees ensuring compliance with the GDPR.

However, the NAIH considered that new circumstances had arisen since the harm had taken place. In particular, the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework had entered into force during the course of the proceedings. As a result, the NAIH found that the circumstances giving rise to the inquiry no longer existed and terminated the complaint.",COMPLIANT,Article 44
"On 1 July 2018, the data subject sent an access request to the controller.

The controller replied with the information of the access request attached as PDF files, and stated that they had deleted the data subject’s account, because they found out, during the processing of his request, that the data subject was not yet of legal age.

On 1 August 2018, the data subject lodged a complaint at the Austrian DPA (“Datenschutzbehörde”). They argued that their right of access had been violated by the controller as their data got deleted even though he had only requested access.

The controller argued that the data subject was requested to provide proof of identity after receiving their request for access. When the controller examined the application, they noticed that the data subject had registered for their customer loyalty programme as a minor (at the age of 14). According to the controller’s terms and conditions, this was not actually permitted. Therefore, the controller cancelled the data subject’s membership and deregistered the data subject from their customer loyalty programme.

The data subject argued that under Article 8(1) GDPR in conjunction with Austrian data protection law (§ 4(4) DSG), they had effectively consented to the processing of their data upon reaching the age of fourteen.","The DPA held that the deletion of data after receipt of an access request but before the response to the access request does not comply with the principle of fair processing under Article 5(1)(a) and thus would constitute a violation of the data subject’s right of access under Article 15 GDPR. However, after the investigation, the DPA found that the controller rightly deleted the data subject’s data after providing information. The DPA found that the information provided by the controller was complete. Therefore, the controller complied with the data subject’s access request under Article 15 GDPR.

However, when it comes to lawfulness of the unrequested deletion, the DPA found that it was legitimate. As a matter of fact, the data subject's registration for a customer loyalty programme had not been effective due to the data subject being a minor. Therefore, there was no lawful purpose for the processing of personal data under Article 5(1)(a) and (b) GDPR. In particular, the DPA held that recital 38 obliges the controller to exercise particular caution and restraint when processing the data of minors.

The DPA dismissed the data subject’s argument that they effectively consented to the processing of their data under Article 8(1) GDPR in conjunction with Austrian data protection law (§ 4(4) DSG).

Although under Article 8(1) GDPR, Member States can lower the age for the processing of the personal data of a child by law, the DPA held that this only applies to the legal act of consenting to data processing under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The national data protection law also only lowered the age to fourteen for the use of “information society services”. The DPA also took into account Article 8(3) GDPR and concluded that the question of the validity of the consent of a minor had no influence on the question of the validity of a contract concluded by the data subject as a minor. Thus, the DPA held that irrespective of the question of whether the controller’s customer loyalty programme is an information society service, the basis for lawfully processing personal data (Article 5(1)(a) and (b) GDPR) did not exist, and the controller was obliged to delete the data subject’s data in accordance with Article 17(1)(a) GDPR, even without an erasure request from the data subject.

Furthermore, the DPA stated that according to the wording of Article 15(1) GDPR, the right of access is essentially limited to the data that is actually being processed at the time the request for access is received. Therefore, the DPA held that no right to the processing of personal data, and thus the right to technical ""reconstruction of the deleted data"", could be derived from Article 15 GDPR, Article 17 GDPR or any other provisions of the GDPR. Therefore, the data subject had no right to the non-erasure of the data that was deleted by the controller.

"The data subject’s parents leased a property to a relative. Upon termination of the residential lease, a release of the rental deposit was agreed. The data subject was asked by a bank (‘controller’) to provide a copy of the identity cards of her parents, or for her parents to go to the bank in person for the purpose of identification.

The data subject refused to do so, arguing that neither the anti-money laundering legislation, nor the legislation on residential tenancy imposed such a requirement for the release of the rental deposit. Moreover, due to their health condition, her parents could not visit the controller in person.

The data subject still provided a copy of her parents’ identity card; expressly stating that this action did not imply her agreement with the requirement to present these documents. She lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (‘GBA’) against the controller.","The GBA explained that the DPA can decide to dismiss a case and that there are two types of dismissals: (i) a ‘technical dismissal’ if the case file contains no or insufficient elements that could lead to a conviction or (ii) a ‘policy dismissal’ if, despite the presence of elements that could lead to a sanction, the continuation of the examination of the complaint does not seem appropriate in the light of the priorities of the DPA. In the present case, the GBA adopted such a ‘policy dismissal’.

First, the GBA did not consider it appropriate to conduct a hearing on the merits because of the low probability of success of the complaint. The DPA explained that it was clear from the submissions made by the data subject that the controller processed identity cards in the context of the obligations imposed on financial banking institutions under the Anti-Money Laundering Act. This regulation requires banks to identify and verify persons at the beginning of the business relationship, but also on an ongoing basis when occasional transactions occur.

The DPA referred to the duty of identification (know your customer principle) and to the duty of vigilance (Anti-Money Laundering Act) and considered that due to the existence of such a legal obligation on the controller, it was not appropriate to deal with the complaint in a hearing on the merits.

Second, the GBA decided not to follow up on the case for reasons of expediency. The DPA indicated that under Article 77 GDPR, any data subject whose personal data are processed within the territorial scope of the GDPR has the right to lodge a complaint. However, the GBA held that this objective right to lodge a complaint does not imply that every complaint can and will also be thoroughly investigated by the competent authority, given the intrinsic lack of resources and referred to CJEU, 16 July 2020, DPC v Facebook Ireland and Maximilan Schrems, C-311/18, §112 for this argument. The DPA pointed out that in this regard, the Belgian legislator has explicitly recognised the need for the DPA to be able to act selectively with a view to an effective and efficient enforcement policy in an explanatory memorandum to a legislative measure proposal.

Finally, the GBA considered that the context of the complaint made it more appropriate for it to be dealt with by another competent authority.",COMPLIANT,Article 77
"Mediahuis Ireland Group Limited (the controller) is a media organization publishing Irish news. A data subject filed a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) concerning a series of news reports in the three of the controller’s newspapers -- the Irish Independent, the Herald and the Sunday Independent – in which their medical data was processed.

The controller claimed that the right to freedom of expression and information for journalistic purposes permitted the processing. Pursuant to section 43 of the Data Protection Act 2018, the DPC initiated an inquiry into the balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to data protection. Under section 43 of the Data Protection Act, processing of personal data for the purpose of exercising the right to freedom of expression and information exempts a controller from complying with several GDPR provisions. This exemption is only applicable in circumstances where compliance with the provision would be incompatible with exercising the right to freedom of expression.

The DPC investigated the applicability of the exemption pursuant to the Section 43 balancing test, considering two things: first, whether the processing was for the purpose of exercising the right to freedom of expression and information; and second, whether compliance with the relevant GDPR provisions would be incompatible with those purposes.","The DPC dismissed the complaint, finding that the freedom of expression and information exemption under section 43(1) of the Data Protection Act of 2018 applied to the controller’s reporting.

The DPC noted that the balancing test favors freedom of expression where the information is published in the public interest. Public interest is defined as an interest in disclosing information that contributes to a debate of general interest – not merely something that is interesting to the public. In this case, the DPC found that the controller was publishing information in the public interest.

The DPC also noted that the fact that medical information is at play is relevant to, but not determinative of, the balance to be struck between freedom of expression and the right to privacy. In cases such as these where “there was a close nexus between the personal data published, including the special category of data, and the debate in the general interest,” freedom of expression overrides.",COMPLIANT,Article 5
"A data subject filed a compliant within the Bulgarian DPA (CPDP), claiming his brother unlawfully processed personal data of him and his family via video surveillance installed on a property co-owned by data subject and his brother.

The property consisted of a three-level building and a yard. Data subject's brother owned the first and second floor of the building and 2/3 of the yard. The mother of brothers had a right to use the second floor and lived there. The third floor belonged to the data subject but it was his daughter who mostly lived there that time.

Three cameras were installed on property, covering only the image of the property, i.e.:

* access to the entrance of the house from inside, 
* a staircase leading to the first floor,
* the entrance the apartment of data subject's brother,
* a part of the yard and patio,
* a corridor which gave access to three rooms in the basement.

No camera covered the second and third floor of the building.

The cameras were connected with a recorder and a router. The recorded videos were stored locally for a period of 2-3 days and were automatically deleted after that period.  Data subject's brother and his wife were using a mobile app to monitor the area and preview recordings. Within the property, there were signs (stickers) warning about the CCTV.

During CPDP inspection, another camera located on the outer fence was discovered. According to data subject's brother it was installed by data subject. It was confirmed that camera was not working, since it was disconnected from electricity.

The proceedings confirmed data subject and his brother were in a private conflict. Data subject's brother explained he installed the video surveillance because of aggressive behaviour and committed acts of vandalism by data subject and his ex-wife. Hence, the data processing was based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.","The CPDP rejected the compliant.

First, the CPDP confirmed CCTV video footage was a personal data within the meaning of Article 4(2) GDPR; found data subject's brother was a data controller and excluded the application of exception of purely personal or household activity of Article 2(2)(c) GDPR.

The CPDP held data subject's brother was entitled to install the CCTV within the property. He did not need a consent of the data subject. The CPDP recalled that according to Article 32 of the Law on Property (ЗАКОН ЗА СОБСТВЕНОСТТА), if a co-owner owned more than a half of the property, they did not need the consent of other co-owners for installing the CCTV. Additionally, the CPDP emphasised that data subject's brother informed people entering on the premises, including the data subject, the area was monitored by the CCTV (stickers warning about the CCTV).

Regarding the lawfulness of the data processing, the CPDP found Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to be a proper legal basis for CCTV-related data processing. In the case at hand, data subject's brother had a legitimate interest of protecting his family and property from data subject improper conduct. However, the CCTV served to protect not only the legitimate interest of data subject's brother but also his child, who could be affected by unlawful actions of the data subject. Still, aforementioned legitimate interest fulfilled the prerequisites of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.",COMPLIANT,Article 6
"A data subject requested access to and erasure of their personal data. A fear of a “major negative personal impact”, including possible defamation was indicated as a reason for the request to erase the data.

The data controller rejected the erasure request, because the data subject gave consent to the data processing and, afterwards, the controller needed to keep the data for an overriding public interest.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA).

During the examination proceedings, the controller argued that the decision to reject the erasure request was based on Article 10 (1)(1) and Article 10 (1)(3) of the Dutch Personal Data Protection Law (Wet betreffende de bescherming van natuurlijke personen met betrekking tot de verwerking van persoonsgegevens). This law authorized the controller to process the data contrary to data subject’s request, since the data subject would potentially be accused of criminal offences and the controller would be involved in the proceedings. Hence, as a party to the proceedings, the controller could provide the authority with necessary evidence.

In addition, the data controller explained that an overriding public interest referred to a type of potential proceedings.","The DPA considered that the compliant consisted of two separate issues, namely the refusal answer the access request and the refusal to fulfil the erasure request.

The DPA rejected the alleged refusal to act on the access request. According to the DPA, the controller did not respond to data subject access request, but during the proceedings the controller confirmed their readiness to do so.

On the allegation of the erasure request refusal, the DPA found it manifestly unfounded. The DPA referred to the wording of Article 17(3)(e) GDPR, which excluded the application of right to erasure in cases where data are necessary “for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.”. The controller proved it was reasonably plausible the data at hand would be used for future (possible) criminal proceedings against data subject. Also, the scope of data requested by the data subject suggested a future proceedings with the data subject were likely.",COMPLIANT,Article 17
"A technician provided a tenant with technical support in their apartment. While providing this technical support, a damage to the apartment occurred and the technician asked the tenant for the contact information of the apartment’s landlord to inform them about the damage.

Eventually, the technician sent the landlord an invoice for the repair of the damage.

The tenant lodged a compliant with the Belgian DPA (ADP/GBA) regarding unlawful processing of the landlord’s data by the technician.","The DPA rejected to handle the compliant.

The tenant, who initiated the proceedings, was not the data subject. Article 220 of Belgian data protection law (Wet betreffende de bescherming van natuurlijke personen met betrekking tot de verwerking van persoonsgegevens) determined the scope of entities allowed to bring a complaint on behalf of data subject. However, by virtue of Article 58 of Act establishing the Data Protection Authority (Wet tot oprichting van de Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit), the DPA was entitled to complaints lodged by any natural person, not only the data subject, if such a person had a sufficient interest in doing so.

Nevertheless, the tenant did not demonstrate the interest to act on behalf of landlord, who was a data subject. As a result, the compliant was inadmissible.",COMPLIANT,Article 77
"A resident (controller) installed five cameras (CCTV) within their premises (a house). The controller obtained the consent of their neighbour (data subject) to process the CCTV data.

A data subject claimed two cameras covered their garden, which was contrary to what they agreed to. Then, the data subject asked the controller to move the cameras adequately and give the data subject access to the recordings to verify their content. Despite multiple tries by the data subject, the controller did not respond to the request.

In the meantime, the controller installed an additional camera – a doorbell camera facing the data subject’s driveway and private entrance.

The data subject consulted the Belgian DPA (APD/GBA) on what further actions they should take. The DPA suggested to contact the local police or to start proceedings before the DPA.

Following the DPA's advice, the data subject contacted the Police who found that the setting of two cameras was changed, so they did not cover the data subject’s premises. Nevertheless, the doorbell camera was programmed to send a notification every time someone showed up within its range. The data subject, requested the controller to change the setting of the doorbell camera as well, but the controller did not reply.

Later, the controller replaced two cameras with new, advanced models (vide-angle lenses) and changed the location of the doorbell, which covered not only the data subject’s premises but also a pavement and a street.

As the mediation before the DPA was unsuccessful (the controller did not respond to official letter of DPA), the data subject decided to lodge a complaint with the DPA.","The DPA decided to close the case due to the expediency.

First, the DPA noted the controller was obliged to answer data subject’s access request under Article 15 GDPR, which they obviously failed to do. Hence, the controller violated Article 12(3) GDPR.

Second, the DPA noted that the controller violated Article 31 GDPR, because they did not respond to any official mails sent by the DPA.

For both violations, the DPA issued a warning to the controller under Article 58(2)(a) GDPR.

Nevertheless, the DPA found the subject matter of the case at hand was a broader dispute and should be heard by a court. Furthermore, the complainant did not provide enough evidence to confirm the CCTV violated the GDPR. Also, there was a parallel proceeding before the Police, making a potential investigation of the DPA pointless.",COMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 31"
"A data subject visited website flair.be, operated by Roularta Media Group N.V. The Google Analytics HTML code was embedded within the website. Because of that, the personal data concerning the data subject were processed, including its transfer to the USA.

The data subject, represented by noyb under Article 80(1) GDPR, filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (ADP/GBA).

During the investigation, the DPA questioned the existence data subject’s interest to initiate the proceedings, in particular, due to the fact the data subject was an trainee at noyb by that time.","The DPA rejected the complaint.

The violation of the GDPR at hand was “artificial”. If it wasn’t for noyb’s project, the data subject wouldn’t found the website concern nor the alleged violation. There was not evidence that the data subject visited the website concerned regularly. For the DPA it meant the visit on the website was done only to allow the violations of the GDPR occur. The data subject didn’t determine the details necessary to bring a case before the DPA on their own as the details were “predetermined” by noyb. Hence, the data subject didn’t enjoy their own “litigation interest”.

Moreover, according to the DPA the abuse of rights took place in the case at hand. The Belgian law didn’t implement Article 80(2) GDPR. Therefore, noyb tried to pursue their own interest, under the cover of the data subject one. Besides, the data subject didn’t act at their discretion, being a trainee interested in satisfying their employer (noyb).  Since the data subject was instructed on the details of the case to lodge the complaint as a part of noyb project, not their own interest, the DPA found noyb abused the right to complaint under Article 80(1) GDPR.

For the subject matter of the case, the DPA referred to the report prepared by its investigatory body. The DPA advised the website operator to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures.",COMPLIANT,Article 80
"A policeman was assigned to supervise a public CCTV. He recorded footage from that CCTV and shared it with his colleagues. The footage showed a data subject.

The data subject lodged a complaint with the Islandic DPA (Persónuvernd) against the Police (the controller). According to the data subject, unauthorised persons had access to their personal data, in particular data subject’s location and travel habits. Allegedly, the footage was also shown to the data subject's colleagues. Also the data subject claimed the policeman recorded the footage using his phone.

The Inspector General of Police explained that the data subject was suspected of not abiding the law. Because of that, it was necessary to inform policemen about the data subject’s movement in a specific area. Also, it was denied that the sharing of data subject’s data with their colleagues took place. The policeman disclosed the data only orally.","The DPA dismissed the case.

Secondly, the DPA found there was no proof the alleged violations occurred.  There was no basis to claim that the processing fell within the scope of the law on processing of personal information for law enforcement purposes, since the alleged disclosure was done orally. Moreover, the disclosure of personal data orally was also not covered by the Law on protection of personal information (Lög nr 90/2018 um persónuvernd og vinnslu persónuupplýsinga).",COMPLIANT,Article 4

The data subject was unable to access their mailbox and asked the controller for help. The controller forwarded the request to its IT department. Also, the controller informed the data subject they were entitled to use a computer within the company premises to access the mailbox.

After few days, the data subject found out their e-mail account password was changed without their consent or notification. Then, the data subject requested access from the controller to their mailbox’s logs and explanation of the situation at stake. The controller didn’t answer the access request.

The data subject claimed the controller failed to answer the access request and suspended their mailbox access.","The DPA dismissed the case on the grounds of expediency (understood as ineffectiveness of potential proceedings before the DPA).

According to the DPA, the subject matter of the case referred to the failure to answer the data subject's access request. The DPA explained the data subject lodged the complaint too early, i.e. three days after the access request was made. Hence, the controller was unable to react within the time frame under Article 12 GDPR. Thus, the violation of the GDPR didn’t occur yet.

"A data subject contacted VÍS (a controller) via phone. During the call the data subject didn’t disclose their identity and asked a general question about a car insurance. Afterwards, they received an e-mail survey from the controller. The survey was aimed to evaluate and improve the contact service with the controller.

The data subject lodged a complaint with the Islandic DPA (Persónuvernd). The data subject claimed they didn’t consent to their phone number being cross-checked with the customer database every time they called the controller. Also the data subject expressed concerns over the lack of possibility to contact the controller anonymously. Moreover, in the opinion of the data subject their phone number was used for a purpose incompatible with the original one.

During the examination proceedings, the controller explained they cross-checked the data subject’s phone number with their customer database to send the e-mail. Once a customer, whose data was stored within the customer database, called the controller, they were automatically identified and the speaker saw the customer’s name and business relation with the controller. The controller claimed they could base this processing on their legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to send surveys, i.e. increasing the quality of customer service.","The DPA dismissed the complaint.

According to the DPA, the controller had a legitimate interest in processing the data subject’s phone number by combining it with customer’s database and sending the survey.

The controller’s privacy policy clearly indicated that one of processing purposes was sending surveys by the controller. Thus, the data subject could have expected to receive such a survey from the controller. Furthermore, the data subject, being the controller’s customer, must have been aware that the controller was able to use their database to check their identity. Additionally, the email sent to the data subject contained the reference to the privacy policy and instruction how to object the processing.",COMPLIANT,Article 6
"The Finnish DPA was notified that an insurance company (the controller) had not provided the data subject with all the requested documents, emails, call recordings and other possible material related to the customer satisfaction survey. Instead, the controller had only provided a transcript, which, according to data subject, differed from the content of the call. The DPA then asked the controller to explain how it had implemented the data subject's request.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it had provided the data subject with all the information requested by the data subject. The controller explained that, as the data subject had requested that the information be provided by post, the controller had provided the data subject with a transcript of the call, which reflected to the content of the call. The controller had then sent the call recording and other documents to the data subject by post on a flash drive.

The data subject had asked the DPA to decide whether the transcript corresponded with the call recording with sufficient accuracy and whether the controller should have provided a copy of the call recording by post immediately or only upon the data subject's new requests.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the controller must assess, on a case-by-case basis, the appropriate format in which to provide the personal data requested under Article 15 GDPR. The DPA emphasised that personal data need not always be provided in the original format if the data can be properly provided in another form, such as, in writing.

The DPA noted that the information provided by the controller enabled the individual to verify the accuracy of the personal data. Therefore, the DPA considered that the controller had complied with the requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR and Article 15(3) GDPR by first providing a written transcript of the call recording.

With regard to the content of the call recording, the DPA found that the transcription of the call corresponded to the content of the call with the accuracy that the nature of the call recording allowed. The DPA found that the key factor in the case was that the data subject had also been provided with a copy of the call recording in electronic form, which had enabled the data subject to assess both the content of the transcription and the content of the call recording.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA concluded that the controller had provided the data subject with all the information requested and had therefore fully complied with the access request.

"The data subject is a manager of a company owned by the Belgian and French governments. Pursuant to the Law of 2 May 1995 on the obligation to file a list of mandates, functions and professions and a declaration of assets (Loi du 2 mai 1995 relative à l’obligation de déposer une liste de mandats, fonctions et professions et une déclaration de patrimoine/Wet betreffende de verplichting om een lijst van mandaten, ambten en beroepen, alsmede een vermogensaangifte in te diene), the data subject was obliged to file a declaration mentioning all her mandates, management functions or professions and how much she was earning from these positions. This information is then published on the Belgian Official Journal (Moniteur Belge - Belgisch Staatsblad) and on the website of the Court of Auditors of Belgium.

The controller, a private entity, collects these pieces of information and publishes them on its website. The main purpose of this website is promoting transparency in the public institutions and displaying people holding multiple offices in Belgium.

The data subject's data was published as well. On 28 September 2021, the data subject objected to the processing according to Article 21(1) GDPR and, therefore, filed an erasure request pursuant to Article 17 GDPR.

On 18 October 2021, the controller refused to erase the data, arguing that:

* the publication of this information on its website contributes to the transparency essential to the proper functioning of democracy with regard to the attribution of certain mandates, functions and professions;
* the information is available on the website of the Court of Auditors and of the Official Journal and its publication in these websites is compulsory by law.

The data subject filed a complaint with the French DPA (Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés - CNIL). Given that the main establishment of the controller is located in Belgium, the complaint was forwarded to the Belgian DPA (Autorité de protection des données/Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit - APD/GBA) pursuant to Article 56(1) GDPR.","First, the DPA noted that the right to erasure is not an absolute right and must be balanced with the fundamental rights granted by the Charter. In order to do so, Article 17(3) GDPR sets some exceptions to the right to erasure.

More specifically, according to Article 17(3)(a) GDPR the right to erasure does not apply to the extent that the processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information.

Therefore, the DPA analysed whether the processing at hand could fall into the scope of this exception.

The DPA pointed out that the controller is not a professional journalist. However, the DPA also noted that both the CJEU and the European Court of Human Rights held that the same role of the press and professional journalists - i.e. being ""public watchdogs"" in a rule-of-law State - can also be exercised by private citizens or entities (see ECtHR, 20/06/2018, Falzon v. Malta], para. 57; CJEU, C-345/17, Buivids], para. 57; CJEU, C-73/07, Satakunnan Markkinapörssi et Satamedia, para. 61).

Therefore, the DPA considered that the processing at hand can fall into the scope of Article 17(3)(a) GDPR.

Moreover, the DPA took into account that the necessity for this data to be made public and known by the citizenship has been decided, for transparency purposes, by the Belgian legislator with the Law of 2 May 1995.

However, the DPA underlined that the online publication of this data does not imply that the information at hand does not fall anymore into the definition of personal data set by Article 4(1) GDPR. Therefore, a legal basis for the processing is needed. In the case at hand, the DPA emphasised that processing activities of journalists can be based on the legitimate interest connected to the fundamental rights of expression.

The DPA pointed out that, according to the CJEU, it is necessary to balance the data subject's right to the protection of personal data with other rights, e.g. the freedom of expression and the right of the public opinion to know how public money is used (see C-465/00, Österreichischer Rundfunk, para. 85).

The DPA took into account the fact that the controller only re-publishes data that is already publicly available online. In addition, the purpose of the controller in the case at hand is exactly the same, i.e. increasing awareness among the citizenship regarding how public money is spent.

Moreover, the DPA noted that the data subject is a ""public figure"" according to the WP29 (see WP29, 'Guidelines on the implementation of the Court of Justice of the European Union judgement on ""Google Spain and Inc v. Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD) and Mario Costeja González"" C-131/12, 14/EN WP 225, p. 13).

On these grounds, the DPA held that the controller rightly refused to erase the data, since the exception provided for by Article 17(3)(a) GDPR applies.

Since the complaint had been filed in France, the DPA sent a draft of the decision to the French DPA pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR. The French DPA did not object to this draft decision.

The processing happened in the context of a litigation in front of controller 2. More specifically, Belgian law requires the tenant to notify the lessors of any change in their civil status. In this instance, the data subject informed controller 1 about their divorce who then communicated this information to controller 2.

The data subject advanced two claims:

-        The data processing was unlawful under Article 6 GDPR; and

-       Controller 2 considered the change in civil status excessively as an infraction happened in 2013 cannot be justified by a divorce that happened in 2020.

The DPA first asked the data subject to contact the two controllers. However, the data subject replied that the violation of the GDPR was so blatant and that they saw no reason to contact them.","The DPA dismissed the case against (a) controller 1 because the request is manifestly unfounded and excessive on the basis of Article 57(4) GDPR. Particularly, the communication of the civil status change to controller 2 falls within the “legitimate interest” linked to their defence in the context of a dispute, and thus was in line with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

Furthermore, the DPA dismissed the case against (b) controller 2 as the analysis of data processing has happened in connection with the exercise of a court's functions, rendering another court, and not the DPA, exclusively competent to examine the complaint.

The complaint is found admissible on the basis of Article 58 and 60 GDPR and subsequently transferred to the Belgian DPA.","The DPA dismissed the complaint on the ground of policy considerations.

First, it held that the data subject failed to demonstrate that it had exercised its rights vis-à-vis the controller as they did not provide sufficient evidence about attempts to exercise their right to erasure as per Article 17 GDPR.

In this regard, the data subject stated that the company in question (the data controller) asked her for a copy of her personal document - identity card when updating her personal data in accordance with special regulations.

As evidence of her allegations, the data subject submitted to the DPA the controller's response, information on the processing of personal data, and the email correspondence between the data subject and the data controller.

In this specific case, the ""Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Act (Zakon o sprečavanju pranja novca i financiranja terorizma - ZSPNIFT)"" applies, which prescribes measures, actions, and procedures that oblige entities and competent state bodies to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing.

Article 15 ZSPNIFT mandates customer due diligence, including identity verification via reliable sources, collecting data on the purpose and nature of business relationships, ongoing transaction monitoring to ensure consistency with the customer's profile and risk assessment, verifying the source of funds if needed, and maintaining up-to-date documentation.

Furthermore, Article 79 ZSPNIFT requires that collected documentation include records used to verify the customer’s identity, such as copies of official personal documents or extracts from relevant registers.

The data subject was contacted via letter and telephone to update his personal data and submit a copy of her ID card, as required by ZSPNIFT. The data controller provided the applicant with the choice of how to submit the ID card copy, as evidenced by a letter dated 16 July 2021. The data controller, justified the collection and processing of personal data, including the ID card copy, as necessary to fulfill its legal obligation to verify customer identity under the Act.","The DPA held that the collection and processing of personal data, including an ID card copy, by the controller is lawful under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR when performed to fulfill legal obligations prescribed by ZSPNIFT.

The DPA stated that state that the controller had a justified reason based on the ZSPNIFT for which it is obliged to unequivocally establish the identity of the client by collecting a copy of the applicant's identity card, as well as a certain amount of personal data.

Furthermore, the DPA held that personal data must be processed lawfully under one of the legal bases set out in Article 6 of the GDPR, and the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency require the data subject to be informed about the processing procedure and its purposes. In this case, the DPA found that the controller fulfilled its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR by informing the data subject about the processing of his personal data, as evidenced by the correspondence and the document detailing the information on the processing.

In this administrative procedure, it was determined that the conditions for fair and lawful processing of personal data, as per Articles 5 and 6 of the GDPR, were met.

"The data subject's father advanced a complaint before the DPA, even if the data subject was not underage. The complaint was against a municipality, the controller and related to the request of the controller to collect a total of eight fingerprints of the data subject when issuing a new ID card, even if Article 6(2) of Belgian Law of 19 July 1991, only requires one fingerprint.

The data subject alleges that, when inquiring about the amount of fingerprints taken, the controller did not disclose the legal basis for the mandatory processing of personal data of the data subject. At the moment of collection of the ID card, eight fingerprints were again scanned.

The controller puts forward that their legal basis is, as per Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, a legal obligation stemming from the Royal decree of 25 March 2003 on identity cards, which itself builds on the Article 6(2) of Belgian Law of 19 July 1991.","The DPA held the following:

Lawfulness of the processing and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in conjunction with Article 6, 12 and 13 GDPR

The DPA considers that the controller had a lawful legal basis for processing fingerprints in the context of creating ID cards under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. The DPA goes as far as stating that there is an “unmistakably” legal obligation on the controller to process fingerprints for ID cards creation.

Violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 12 and 13 GDPR

The DPA starts its analysis by stating that no document can confirm that whether the data subject obtained the information when the fingerprints were provided, i.e. when the processing started.

Nevertheless, the DPA reiterated that the controller is under the obligation of provide a data subject with all information required when the fingerprints are first taken, as per Article 13 GDPR. The controller is under the further obligation to provide the information requested when the personal data are obtained from the data subject as per Article 13 GDPR and to ensure transparency in information and communication under Article 12 GDPR.

The DPA found that no violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 12 and 13 GDPR.

Violation of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR

In relation to a possible violation of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR, the DPA considered first the fact that fingerprints are digitalized by ad hoc sensors at the initiative of the municipal authority. The digital image of these prints is then securely transmitted through the services for the National Registry to issue ID cards. This means that after fingerprints are registered and kept for up to three months to produce electronic ID cards. This is necessary so that the card producer can put the correct data on the chip, avoiding the need to re-register fingerprints in case of any technical malfunction. No later than three months from registration, the fingerprints are removed from the system and only one fingerprint per hand remains on the chip of the electronic ID.

Thus, the DPA concluded that there is no indication that the principle of purpose limitation, under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR, is violated.

In relation to a possible violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, the fact that multiple fingerprints are processed per hand is motivated by the fact that it is prescribed by law that the best quality fingerprint should be integrated into the chip. This justifies the fact that several fingerprints per hand should be taken to select the best one.

Moreover, the storing of fingerprints for maximum three months indicates that the digital image of the fingerprints is only kept for the time necessary for the creation and issuance of the ID card. This ensures that fingerprints are not kept longer than necessary.

Thus, the DPA concluded that no violation of the principle of data minimization, as per Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

To conclude, the DPA did not find any violation of Article 5(1)(b), 5(1)(c), 6(1)(a), 12 and 13 GDPR.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13"
"Complaint

On the 18 June 2018, the data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA against Radio Télévision Belge de la Communauté francaise (RTBF), the controller.

The data subject complained that the live services of the controller are only available in Belgium if an email, login via Facebook or Google account is provided. Further, if users deactivate cookies and tracking by third parties, the connection fails. The data subject set out that the service should be available without having to surrender personal data.

Initially, the controller argued that it is pursuing a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR in collecting the data.

Investigation by the Investigative Service (IS) of the Belgian DPA (APD)

The investigation found that the controller collected the following data: first and surname, password, email address, phone number, date of birth and gender identity.

To the investigation by the SI, the controller argued that the principle of impartiality under Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights had not been respected. The controller alleged that the language used in the report issued by the investigative service of the DPA strongly favoured the position of the data subject.

Furthermore, the controller stated that it did not have enough time to answer the questions posed by the DPA and that the DPA had denied to meet the controller in person. It argued that due to this time pressure, it had made a mistake regarding the legal basis of the processing. Therefore, the true legal basis for the processing was in fact Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The controller described that the TV service is a personalized service and that users are informed of this in the privacy policy. Therefore, creating an account for the service equates to a contractual relationship according to the controller and the data collected is necessary for the contract.","Alleged partiality of the SI

In regard to the allegations of  partiality on the part of the IS, the Litigation Chamber of the DPA found that based on Article 66 §1 of the Belgian law on the powers of the DPA (La loi du 3 décembre 2017 portant création de l'Autorité de protection des données - LCA), the IS of the DPA did not have the power to meet with the controller and therefore rejected the controller's argument.

Account creation

The IS had found that the users were not adequately informed that the Facebook login option in fact created an account with the controller. However the LC found that the controller had made it sufficiently clear that a login with Facebook would create a user account with the controller and therefore found no violation.

Legal basis for the processing

The Litigation Chamber (LC) held that the controller cannot switch between legal basis and that the legal basis for processing must be set prior to the processing. The LC further pointed out that the tight deadline could not have been a valid reason for mixing up the legal basis as the legal basis should have been determined before the processing began.

However, the LC chose not to sanction the failure to identify the correct legal basis and assessed whether Article 6(1)(b) GDPR could provide a valid legal basis for the processing. The LC found that a contractual relationship existed and that the contract was valid under Belgian law. With regard to the necessity requirement, the LC pointed out that the service cannot be deliverable unless the data is processed, otherwise, the necessity requirement is not met. In addition, the LC highlighted that the data subject’s understanding of the necessity of the data processing must also be taken into account by the controller.

The LC found that the following details were in fact necessary for the contract in order to securely identify individuals: Name, password and email address. In regard to the phone number, date of birth, gender identity and profile picture, the LC held that the contract provided by the controller stipulated that it offered a personalised service and that a certain amount of personal data is therefore necessary to fulfill the purpose of the contract. The LC highlighted that the controller must make it clear to data subjects that entering this information is optional. It found that entering further details such as the date of birth, was in fact optional and not a requirement for the account creation.

The LC therefore found no violation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in regard to the collected data. Further, the LC concluded that although the controller had violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, 5(1)(b) GDPR and 6(1) GDPR for failing to determine the legal basis before processing data, it chose to dismiss these violations based on the specific circumstances of the case. It therefore merely issued a reprimand to the controller for the failure to identify a legal basis prior to processing.",COMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The Data Protection Authority (DPA) received a complaint that Helsingør Kommune (City Council, Data Controller) processes and refuses to delete a number of data collected illegally by a third party. The data was being used in a in an investigation following a disclosure on the Data Subjects’ possible mistreatment of child. 
Part of the investigation is interception by means of microphones found to be violation of Penal code (Straffeloven 263(2)). 
The illegal interception was forwarded to the Data Controller along with the disclosure for possible mistreatment of child by the third party.
On the basis of objection by the Data Subject the City Council initially decided to disregard the interception and transcription, as the Data Controller assumed the data to be collected illegally. The Data Controller also deleted the data.
Subsequently the third party chose to re-send the illegally collected data to the Data Controller [again].
The Data Controller later chose to change their original decision (to disregard the data) and use the illegal data. This under the consideration of the greater interests of the child and because of a received disclosure from the Family Court (Familieretshuset). In the disclosaure the Familiy Court expresses concerns over the Data Controllers closure of the investigation and requests the case be re-opened.  In addition the Family Court requests that the Data Processer takes the  intercepted data into consideration, irrespective of their legality.
The Data Controller believes that the processing of the data services a factual and necessary purpose, even if they have been attained through a criminal act. 
After receiving the complaint, the DPA consults The Danish Data Protection Council (Datarådet).","The Data Protection Authority (DPA)  takes the [[Article 6 GDPR#1e|Article 6(1)(e)]] and [[Article 5 GDPR#1|Article 5(1)]], [[Article 5 GDPR#1b|(b)]], [[Article 5 GDPR#1c|©]] into consideration.

The data subject transmitted the answer to the DPA and claimed that the data processing could not be based on a legitimate interest of the controller.

On 8 March 2024, the processor communicated to the data subject that their previous reply to the access request was incorrect.

On 11 March 2024, the data subject requested access to their data from the controller to verify the information given by the processor. The controller responded to the data subject that only the necessary data was transmitted to the processor.

Generally, the DPA may dismiss a complaint either due to insufficiency of elements to likely to lead to a sanction; or due to the need for expediency.

In this case, the DPA closed the complaint as it is manifestly unfounded. The DPA observed that information about the data sharing from controller to processor was was provided for in the controller’s privacy policy, to which the data subject consented. So, the legal basis for such processing would be Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.

However, the DPA noticed that, among the data transmitted, there was also the gender of the data subject. The DPA considered that there was no need to process that information in the context of a satisfaction survey. As found by the CJEU in C-394/23 Mousse, processing of information about the data subject's gender may raise doubts as per the requirements of the GDPR. In the case at hand, the DPA found no violation of the principle of data minimisation as per Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

On 22 April 2020, the data subject lodged a complaint to the DPA regarding the dismissal decision.

From the 4 June 2020 to the 11 February 2025, the DPA carried out the proceedings and heard the participants.","The DPA dismissed the complaint due to the following reasons.

Identification of the controller

The DPA recalls that the controller is defined as the entity who determines the purpose and means of the data processing (Article 4.7 GDPR).

The DPA clarifies that when an organization’s employee processes data, the processing is typically considered as directed under the organization’s authority. But in this case, the manager unlawfully exceeding the powers given to them by defining the purpose of the processing on his own. For this reason, the DPA considered the manager as the sole only controller.

Notification of the violation to the DPA

The DPA reminds that the controller must notify the authority of any violation, except if the violation is not likely to create a risk for rights and freedom of the data subject (Article 33.1 GDPR). The DPA underlines that even in case of doubt, or if the controller can’t be sure of the absence of such a risk, the controller must notify the authority.

Also, the DPA recalls that a risk can be found in the circumstances of a loss of confidentiality, especially when the data were protected by professional secrecy and reveal the health status of the data subject (Recital 75 GDPR).

After recalling these legal provisions, the DPA points out that even if the employer is not the controller, the employer should have notified the violation to the DPA (Article 33 GDPR).

Security of the personal data, technical and organisational measures

The DPA states that the data must be processed in a way that guarantees its security, especially protecting it against unauthorized processing (Article 5.1 f) GDPR). The DPA also underlines that the controller must take appropriated organizational and technical measures, adapting it to the context, nature, scope, purpose and risks of the processing (Article 24 and Article 32.1 GDPR).

Here, the DPA indicates that a hospital processes a large amount of personal data, which calls for vigilance. In addition, the subordinate relationship between the data subject and their manager was a compelling reason not to consult the data subject’s medical file.  But the DPA observes that it is not possible to determine in advance the medical staff who will have to treat a patient. This circumstance justifies the global access of the medical staff to the data subject’s files.

Even if the DPA recognizes the security measures as insufficient, the DPA highlights that these measures are designed to evolve, and that the controller acted as pro-active.",COMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 24, Article 32, Article 33"

The controller refused on grounds that downloading screenshots was a premium feature reserved for paying users. The data subject then filed a complaint, claiming that the controller violated his right of access and his right to data portability.","The DPA did not examine the complaint on the merits.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Hellenic DPA  (Aρχή Προστασίας Δεδομένων Προσωπικού Χαρακτήρα-HDPA), alleging that the controller processed his personal data unlawfully  violated his right to object.

Specifically, he claimed that the controller obtained his criminal record without his consent, disclosed it to the board of directors, shared it with internal staff and a cooperating law firm, and made related information publicly available through a 'public administration decisions transparency platform' (ΔΙΑΥΓΕΙΑ).  The data subject further claimed that the  controller failed to respond adequately to his objection to the processing of his personal data.

The controller claimed that the processing of the data subject's personal data was lawful and necessary. It stated that the processing was carried out within the framework of competences of its internal management and legal obligations, plus, a confidential protocol was kept at all times. It had a legitimate interest in knowing his criminal record, since its relevant provisions of the rules of procedure provide that a Head of Projects is prohibited from having a felony conviction.","First, the DPA held that the controller lawfully received a copy of the data subject's criminal record, after submitting a relevant request before the Public Prosecutor's Office, the content of which was judged by the competent prosecuting authority.

Second, the DPA held that the controller lawfully disclosed the data subject's personal data to its cooperating law firm and board of directors since it was intended to fulfill its legal duties and defend its legal interests in the context of the need to establish and support its legal claims. The personal data processed where appropriate, relevant and limited to what was strictly necessary to achieve the objective pursued.

Third, the DPA found that the controller lawfully posted the termination of the contract to the said platform under a legal obligation of the Administration (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR). Furthermore, the data was absolutely necessary for the intended purpose of transparency and control of state action, in accordance with the principle of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR).

The data subject then filed a complaint to challenge the controller’s refusal.","The DPA denied the data subject’s request on grounds that the article (in its updated version) was both accurate and up to date. The GDPR further considered that news about the proceedings was of public interest due to the data subject's position as a public officer.

The DPA also clarified that precautionary measures (as well as their revocation) do not, by definition, close legal proceedings. Therefore, the data subject's legal position (i.e.: being suspected of, and investigated for, a criminal offence) did not change when home arrest was revoked.",COMPLIANT,Article 16
"The dentist, Dr. Marini, required that patients fill out a medical history questionnaire before receiving dental services at his office. The questionnaire asked about previous, existing or suspected infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV). The complainant, a prospective patient, indicated that he was positive for an HIV infection. The dentist subsequently refused to give him dental treatment, claiming that the complainant’s HIV infection would prevent him from “averting a possible contagion of staff and other patients.”

Italian national law (Law of June 5 1990, n. 135) holds that specific precautions to prevent contagion should be taken for each individual patient, such that patients with HIV infections can access dental services. Meanwhile, Article 5 GDPR provides that personal data must be processed in a lawful and transparent manner, relevant and limited to what is necessary with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (the principles of ""lawfulness, fairness, transparency"" and “data minimization”). In combination, this means that patient history on infectious diseases can only be used to provide a better plan of medical treatment.","The Italian DPA (Garante) held that Dr. Marini had violated the basic principles of processing in Article 5 GDPR by collecting information on infectious diseases from patients regardless of the type of intervention to be carried out to provide care. In this way, Dr. Marini processed personal data about HIV infection status in a way that is not relevant to the purpose for which it can be processed. Information about infection history can only be collected in order to know the patient's clinical history and to identify the most appropriate therapy. Further, information about HIV infection can only be collected if it is deemed necessary by the treating physician for the type of health intervention.

Using HIV infection information to refuse treatment, is not, however, a legitimate and necessary basis for processing such data. The DPA explained that Dr. Marini failed to process the complainant’s health data with the concrete purpose of evaluating the best therapy for the patient, offering him the required service, and possibly also taking additional measures against the risk of contagion.

Therefore, and pursuant to Article 83 GDPR, the DPA issued the dentist with an administrative fine of € 20,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 83"
"The Italian data protection rules in the field of health allows the creation of an ""Electronic Health Record"" related to the patient and including all the relevant information (e.g. visit details, medical interventions, clinical tests, etc). The health record is available online to the data subject and can be shared with medical professionals only upon explicit consent. Furthermore, the patient can ask for data masking, which guarantees that selected information can be seen only by the patient and the data controller.

In this case, a patient in Romagna asked for data masking regarding a medical intervention to have an abortion, but, due to a technical error, the software shared the information with the patient's general practitioner. This resulted in the disclosure of special categories of personal data without any suitable legal basis and in violation of an explicit request for obfuscation made by the data subject. The Local Health Authority of Romagna subsequently notified the DPA of a data breach, and the DPA started an investigation and found out that the same data sharing affected other 48 data subjects.","The DPA held that the Local Health Authority of Romagna violated art. 5(2)(a), 5(2)(f), and 9 of the GDPR because the data processing (the transfer of the personal data related to the abortion from the hospital to the general practitioner) did not have an appropriate lawful basis.

In calculating the €120,000 EUR fine, the DPA took into account the categories of personal data involved and the context of the violation. In particular, they considered that the Authority became aware of the event following notification of a personal data breach by the data controller; the number of data subjects involved in the breach (48 persons); the violations, even if due to a software error, led to a non-episodic communication of special categories of personal data under art. 9 of GDPR; the absence of wilful misconduct; the event was immediately taken into account both by the health authority and by the health authority's data processor; the health authority was immediately cooperative; and that the health authority had already been subject to a fine from the DPA in relation to a patient admitted to the gynecology ward.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 58, Article 83"
"Deliveroo Italy is owned by the UK company Roofoods LTD, whose data center is located in Ireland. They are joint controllers of rider data. When the Garante started to investigate Deliveroo Italy, Roofoods clarified that Deliveroo Italy had 8,000 riders who use the Deliveroo rider app. Roofoods acquires personal and contract data, payment data, data relating to the vehicle used for deliveries, and determines how to process riders’ data. It claims that the rider booking system in Italy is based on availability during critical time slots and reliability of the rider (ie actual participation in the reserved shifts or cancellation prior to the start of the shift). The app also tracks the management of an order by a rider (from acceptance of the order to delivery) and tracks the location of the rider every twelve seconds.

After investigation, the Garante notified Deliveroo Italy and Roofoods that it had found violations of Articles 5(1)(a)(c)(e), 13, 22(3), 25, 30(1)(c)(f)(g), 32, 35, 37(7), and 88 of the GDPR.

In defensive briefs, UK Roofoods contended that it was going to review its data retention policies, that Deliveroo riders were sufficiently informed about the data processed on them, and that data collected on riders (such as geographical position) was necessary for the service. It also argued that statistics about the algorithms behind the booking system are available to riders on a dedicated page in the app, and that on Sunday each rider is informed about their access to booking times for the following week.","Just one month after Foodinho was fined €2,600,000 for intransparent rider management algorithms, the Garante decided to issue a very similar fine against Deliveroo.

First, the Garante held that Deliveroo had provided inadequate information amount management algorithms to interested parties (riders) and to failed to comply with the principle of transparency. The privacy policy provided to riders failed to indicate the concrete methods of processing data relating to the geographic position of the riders. The Garante explained that the particular invasiveness of location sharing imposes the need to provide information on the specific methods and timing of the detection of the geographical position. Furthermore, automated processing of geographic location amounts to a kind of profiling under Article 22, necessitating enhanced disclosure obligations. Deliveroo failed to provide information on the logic used, as well as the importance and expected consequences of such profiling.

Profiling carried out by the company in this area certainly produces a significant effect on the rider concerned, consisting in the possibility of allowing (or denying) access to job opportunities, in certain pre-established time slots, and therefore offering (or denying) an opportunity of use. The system is designed to present, with priority, the choice of work shifts to those who have acquired a higher score and penalizes riders with a lower score, even though a score can be lowered by simply not logging into the app at the right time. There is a fundamental lack of transparency about these assignment algorithms, information about which has not been made publicly available.

Secondly, Deliveroo had failed to provide information on the criteria used to determine its data retention policies, violating Article 13. The company had provided for the retention for 6 years, after the termination of the employment relationship, of different types of data of the riders collected for a variety of purposes. In light of the need to identify retention times deemed appropriate in relation to each of the purposes actually pursued with the processing of the various types of personal data, the company cannot simply retain all data for blocks of homogeneous time bands.

Deliveroo thus violated Article 5 GDPR, which provides that personal data must be kept ""in a form that allows the identification of the data subjects for a period of time not exceeding the achievement of the purposes for which they are processed"". In particular, the data controller has the obligation ""to ensure that the retention period of personal data is limited to the minimum necessary"" (see Recital 39).

Thirdly, Deliveroo provided misleading information to riders about their rights as data subjects, for example, suggesting that they could file a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) despite being in Italy. In this way it failed to facilitate the exercise of rights by riders.

Fourth, Deliveroo violated the principle of data minimization and protection by design and by default. The app systems are configured in such a way as to collect and store all data relating to the management of the order, and to allow authorized operators to pass simple functions from one system to another, with consequent sharing of the data collected across the various systems. Despite defensive briefs, Deliveroo did not provide any specific reasons why all this data collection and data sharing is necessary for the provision of its services.

Deliveroo also failed to take adequate technical and organizational measures to guarantee adequate security of the processing, in violation of Article 32 GDPR, and failed to undertake a data protection impact assessment, in violation of Article 35.

For the above reasons, the Garante fined Deliveroo Italy €2,500,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 22, Article 25, Article 30, Article 32, Article 35, Article 37, Article 88"
"A student at the 'Luigi Bocconi' Commercial University of Milan filed a complaint to the Italian DPA (Garante) regarding possible violations of the GDPR by the academic institution. They alleged that it unlawfully requested students' consent to the processing of special categories of personal data. If they refused, students would not be able to carry out online exams.

In response to a 'request for clarification' about this processing by the complainant, the university's DPO informed them it considered this processing to be necessary to carry out exams at a distance given the COVID-19 pandemic.","The Italian DPA considered a range of issues in this case.

First, it assessed the general conditions of lawfulness of the processing of personal data in the university environment. It held the same data protection framework applies to public and private universities. Consequently, the processing of student data aimed at issuing university qualifications could not be based on legal bases such as consent and/or contract, and the data controller was required to comply with general principles of data protection per Article 5 GDPR. It also had to guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the processing was carried out in accordance with the GDPR, and in particular take into account the principle of data protection by design and default per Article 25 GDPR.

Second, the DPA considered whether the university could generally process of student data through the 'Respondus' software it used to monitor students during their exams. The software ""captures the video images and the student's screen by identifying and marking with a flag the moments in which unusual and/or suspicious behaviour is detected by video recording and snapshots taken at random intervals to keep track of anomalous behaviour such as: look not turned towards the monitor, face partially absent from the photo, missing face"". It then flags such behaviour for further review. The Garante held the use of such software by universities was generally acceptable in light of the COVID-19 pandemic requiring exams to be carried out remotely, but that they must ensure compliance with principles of data protection. It highlighted possible risks related to the processing of special categories of data, profiling, and international data transfers.

Third, the DPA analysed whether the university complied with its transparency obligations per Articles 5(1)(a), 12 and 13 GDPR. It held all the information required by the GDPR had not been provided. The university only provided ""generic information"" about the processing without specific reference to the 'Respondus' software, no information about the retention of relevant data, no information about possible data transfers to the US (where the company providing the software was based), and no explanation of the logic involved in the profiling done by the software.

Fourth, the DPA assessed on which legal basis the university could have based the processing of students' biometric data. The university claimed to have obtained students' consent for the processing of data through the 'Respondus' system. The DPA nonetheless held this was neither an allowable legal basis nor a ""manifestation of free will"" per Article 4(1)(11) GDPR given the power imbalance between students and the university (if they did not 'consent', they could not pass their exams). The processing could have only been lawful if it was ""necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject"" (Article 9(2)(g) GDPR), which it was not.

Fifth, the DPA held that the university failed to take account of the specific risks arising from the profiling of students by the software, which took the form of different coloured flags they were tagged under depending on their movements during exams, in violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 6 GDPR. This profiling should have been ""clearly represented to the interested parties"" and ""necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest"" per Article 6(1)(e) GDPR.

Sixth, the DPA held the university failed to ""adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the principles of data protection (Article 5 GDPR), such as the principles of minimization and limitation of conservation referred to in Articles. 5(1)(c) and (e) GDPR and integrating into the processing the necessary guarantees to meet the requirements of the Regulation and protect the rights and freedoms of the interested parties"". Notably, it retained exam data for 5 years, which the DPA held to be disproportionate to ensure the regularity of exams.

Seventh, the DPA held the university unlawfully transferred students' personal data to the US through the software, in violation of Articles 44 and 46 GDPR. This transfer was based on the Privacy Shield agreement which was struck down in 2020 by the CJEU in Schrems II. The DPA highlighted as particuarly concerning the fact that special categories of data, such as biometric data, were being transferred.

Finally, the university failed to carry out proper data protection impact assessments in violation of Article 35 GDPR.

Thus, the DPA fined the university a total of €200,000 for the violation of Articles. 5(1)(a), (c) and (e), 6, 9, 13, 25, 35, 44 and 46 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 25, Article 35, Article 44, Article 46"

First, the DPA found that Sky Italia unlawfully processed personal data for the purpose of promoting its own products and services without the required consent and suitable information; that the company failed to carry out necessary checks on contact lists acquired from third parties; and that it failed to correctly register objections to receiving marketing calls. (In violation of Articles 5(1), (2), 6(1), 7, 14 and 21 GDPR.)

Second, the Garante held that the company contravened the principle of accountability and provisions on consent, and failed to verify the legitimacy of the communication of data from different third party data suppliers (Wind Tre S.p.A.; Brands Up); failed to check the information provided by its suppliers at the time of the first contact with the people the company called; did not correctly appoint suppliers as data processors; did not adopt procedures for filtering the contact lists, leading them to remain available to the person who carried out the promotional contacts.

Third, the DPA held that Sky lacked the consent necessary to lawfully make direct marketing calls. (In violation of Articles 5(1), (2), 6 and 7 GDPR)

Fourth, it found the company infringed Articles 5, 6, 7, 12, 13 and 21 GDPR, in relation to the procedures for activating, providing information on and revoking the ""Call me now"" service.

Violation of Article 5(1)(d) GDPR, for having mistakenly associated the number from which a call had been made to the company's free phone number with the claimant's personal data (presumably a landline used once only once by the claimant).

Violation of Article 5(1)(d) and Article 6 GDPR, for having sent, via invoices, personal data to a user other than the holder of the contract following the association of the tax code of the claimant with another company user, because of the alleged similarity between the two codes.

Violation of Article 12 GDPR, by failing to provide the necessary and timely feedback to the data subjects on the legitimate requests to exercise their rights (in this case, the right of access and the right to object).

Violation of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 12(2) GDPR for providing a contradictory response to a further request for the exercise of rights made by the data subject in relation to the receipt of promotional calls via a pre-recorded message.

Violation of Article 21 GDPR and Article 130(1) and (2) Italian Privacy Act (Codice Privacy), for having unduly sent promotional communications by e-mail, despite the refusal expressed by the data subject, both when signing the energy supply contract with respect to the data processing for marketing purposes, and through the subsequent opposition to the processing expressly addressed to the dedicated e-mail box.

Violation of Article 130(4) Italian Privacy Act for having sent a communication concerning registration in the company's loyalty programme without the claimant's consent or an applicable exception under this provision, or GPDP decision 2542348 of 4 July 2013.

Violation of Article 6(1) GDPR, as well as Article 130 (1) and (2) Italian Privacy Act, for not having acquired a specific and appropriate consent from the data subjects with regard to processing carried out by different subjects in their capacity as independent data controllers.

For these reasons, the Italian DPA imposed multiple corrective measures and a fine of € 26,513,977 to Enel Energia according to its faculties under Article 58(2)(a), Article 58(2)(b) and Article 58(2)(d), as well as Article 83(5) GDPR,",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24, Article 25, Article 31"
"Following the receipt of several marketing SMS from a sender named Dorelan, the data subject tried to stop the unwanted activity by contacting what appeared to be the owner of the Dorelan brand, that is to say the company B&T Spa. The latter, however, claimed to have no involvement in the sending of the SMS and referred the data subject to another third party company, Aimon Srl. The data subject subsequently contacted Aimon in order to exercise their rights of access and objection. However, also Aimon denied any responsibility by claiming that the data subject's contact details had been obtained from other database suppliers.

During the investigation, the Italian DPA verified that B&T Spa had instructed Aimon to send promotional SMS to potential customers. The marketing company then made use of other suppliers who in turn had acquired the databases from third parties. In this succession of steps, based on the model of ""Chinese boxes"", it emerged that the data of the people contacted came from unverified, most likely unlawful collection activity. Just to name a couple, two data brokers had declared their offices in Florida and Switzerland. None of them had ever appointed their own representative in Italy or, to our knowledge, in any other Member State, in violation of Article 27 GDPR.","Taking into account the circumstances of the case, the Italian DPA affirmed that B&T was certainly to be qualified as data controller and Aimon as data processor. More precisely, B&T had, among other things, determined the reason for which the processing was carried out (the sending of promotional messages) and had chosen the criteria that Aimon should have followed in carrying out such activity.

The Italian DPA held that B&T had violated different provisions. First, the company did not seek any consent prior to the sending of the advertising SMS, therefore violating Article 6 (1)(a) GDPR and Article 130 of the Italian Privacy Code. Second, the company failed to define the roles within the data processing chain, did not provide clear information to the data subject and, in so doing, made it impossible for the data subject(s) to exercise their right. This amounted to a violation of Article 5 (1)(a), Article 12, Article 13, Article 14 GDPR and Article 21 GDPR.

Therefore, on the basis of all the elements indicated above, the DPA held that a €400,000 fine should be applied to B&T.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 21"
"Clearview A.I. Inc. (Clearview) is a company conducting facial recognition on public web sources and is the data controller. Four data subjects had sought information from Clearview under Article 15 GDPR. Clearview replied to three of them and provided “special reports” containing the results obtained through the Clearview software. In 2021, these data subjects complained to the Italian DPA (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali) regarding the processing of their personal data by Clearview, without their consent. In addition, two ""organisations committed to defending the privacy and fundamental rights of individuals"" submitted information about precedents in Germany and Sweden, and their reports on activities of Clearview to the DPA. Based on the press reports on the activities of Clearview and the complaints submitted to it, the DPA opened an investigation.

Before the DPA, Clearview submitted as follows:

The GDPR was not applicable and the DPA lacked jurisdiction as Clearview was not offering its services in Italy and had utilized technical measures to block Italian IP addresses from accessing services of Clearview. Clearview was not carrying out any monitoring activity as per Article 3(2)(b) GDPR, and its search results were akin to Google Search. Clearview did not have a list of Italian customers, and its privacy policy did not refer to GDPR. Clearview did not have a representative in the Union as mandated by Article 27 GDPR. Accordingly, the activities of Clearview were not covered by the GDPR.

Since 2019, law enforcement agencies in the United States (US) were using Clearview, “especially in the context of child pornography investigations”. This generated international interest and several European government agencies signed up for a test account for a short time.

In March 2020, following complaints by regulators in European Union (EU), these test accounts, which were very few, were closed.

Clearview does not have any customers in the EU, and it ensures the same through “specific setting that prevents access to the software via European IP addresses.”

Clearview’s technology is used by law enforcement agencies and assists them in identifying criminals. As per Clearview’s terms, it is the responsibility of its customers to “verify that the use of this product is legitimate in light of the local regulations applicable to it.”

Clearview contractually requires its users to conduct further investigations and independently corroborate information collected using Clearview.

Clearview is based in the US and has no branch in the EU. It neither offers its services in the EU nor monitors behaviour.

Clearview did expand to Canada but ceased all its activities in Canada following the proceedings initiated by the Canadian Privacy Commissioners. This expansion cannot be considered to demonstrate its intention of entering the Italian market.

Journalistic sources cannot be relied upon as they are speculative.

The Swedish decision was concerning the above test accounts that existed for a short period and were available to Swedish police forces.

Clearview did not conduct any behavioural analysis or use any profiling techniques. Collection of data, even of significant volume, does not automatically constitute profiling.

The Data Controller is Clearview’s customer (i.e. police forces) and not Clearview itself, and this was held by the Swedish authority.

Clearview “does not collect or provide any information about the location, browser history, business activity or behaviour of the natural person who appears as a search result and does not imply any behavioural, predictive or analytical modeling. The information that can be obtained about an individual using Clearview's search engine is less meaningful than the information that can be obtained from a Google Search based on that individual's name, and no one is claiming that a Google browser search constitutes behavioral monitoring.”

Clearview is compliant with US law and it is impossible to take into account all existing laws in a globalized world. “Moreover, since Google's search engine is presumed to comply with European laws because Google is established in the EU and offers its services to users in the EU, if the Regulation were also found to apply to Clearview, the processing of the complainant's data should be considered lawful”.

Clearview voluntarily complies with requests for access from European residents, even though it is not bound to do so.","The DPA determined as follows:

Clearview “not only collects images to make them accessible to its customers, but also processes the collected images by web scraping, through a proprietary facial matching algorithm, in order to provide a highly qualified biometric search service.” As per its website, the free service is not available to the public but only to certain category of customers (i.e. police forces). Therefore, “the platform offered by Clearview assumes peculiar characteristics that differentiate it from a common search engine that does not process or enrich images present on the network. In particular, Clearview does not work on cache memory, but creates a database of snapshots of images that are stored as present at the time of collection and not updated. Moreover, as mentioned above, Clearview processes these images with biometric techniques, hashes them and associates them with any available metadata”. Thus, its services are not like those being offered by Google.

Clearview is the data controller as it “uses its own means to collect images and subsequently transform them into biometric data, and has a proprietary database in which the information is stored and extracted as a result of the search performed by the user. The purpose pursued by Clearview is therefore that of making available, in return for a fee, information such as images and metadata, useful to customers for the pursuit of different and additional purposes.”

The DPA has jurisdiction and GDPR is applicable to Clearview as it once did offer its services to European users. Moreover, Clearview’s activities, as revealed from its patent application filed in the US constitute “monitoring of behaviour”. In addition, Clearview’s website states, “the data collected include not only photographs available to the public and available on the Internet, but also information that can be extracted from those photographs, such as the geolocation metadata that they may contain, as well as information derived from the analysis of the faces of the persons depicted and which, as such, constitute biometric data on the basis of which the comparison process is carried out.” Accordingly, Article 3(2) GDPR is applicable. Moreover, the issue of DPA’s jurisdiction and powers qua Clearview has also been decided by CNIL in a different matter.

The photographic image of a person, as long as the person is identified or identifiable, constitutes personal data. The fact that the photographs were already available on the internet “is not sufficient to consider that data subjects can reasonably expect them to be used for facial recognition purposes, moreover by a private platform, not established in the EU and of whose existence and activity most data subjects are unaware.” Web Scraping activities are almost always prohibited by social media platforms and press reports have shown that “Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn have sent Clearview a cease and desist letter to stop collecting data that can be used to identify a person.”

Clearview not only collected personal data but through further processing converted a photograph into biometric data.

Clearview did not comply with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR “which requires compliance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency in the processing of data with regard to the data subject”.

Clearview violated Article 5(1)(b) GDPR which “provides for compliance with the principle of purpose limitation.”

Clearview violated Article 5(1)(e) GDPR which “provides for compliance with the principle of storage limitation.” This was because there was “no indication of any retention period either from the analysis of Clearview's privacy policy, or from the feedback received from the Company, which was incomplete on this point, or from the information contained in the complaints submitted by the interested parties.”

Clearview did not have any valid basis under Article 6 GDPR for the processing of personal data. It’s claimed legitimate economic interest “cannot but be at odds with the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, and in particular with the serious threat to the right to privacy, the prohibition of automated processing and the principle of non-discrimination inherent in the processing of personal data such as that carried out by the Company.”

Clearview violated Article 9 GDPR due to its “processing of special categories of data (with reference to biometric data).”

Clearview violated Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 GDPR as the data subjects “had to repeat their requests for access several times before receiving a reply from Clearview, despite the fact that the contact channels indicated on the company's website (online form and e-mail address dedicated to privacy requests) had been used.” Moreover, “Clearview, in order to process requests for access, has asked the interested parties to provide identification, such as an identity document, which is excessive in relation to the objective pursued” as there were no “reasonable doubts” as to the identity of the data subjects. Clearview did not provide timely, complete, up to date, “precise and transparent communication” to the data subjects.

Clearview breached Article 27 GDPR by not having its representative in the territory of the EU.

There were no grounds to determine a violation of Article 22 GDPR as Clearview had “not provided any specific evidence in this regard, and no technical system elements are currently available that could corroborate the thesis of the existence of automated processing.”

Clearview’s violations were considered to be serious as they were akin to mass surveillance. They were not isolated events and continued even after “service was no longer offered to customers established in the European Union.” Thus, the DPA directed Clearview to do the following:

1) Prohibit (any further) processing of: i) collection, by means of web scraping techniques, of images and related metadata of data subjects on Italian territory; ii) common and biometric data processed through its facial recognition system of data subjects on Italian territory.

2) Delete the “aforementioned data, without prejudice to the obligation to provide timely feedback to requests to exercise the rights” given under Articles 15-22 GDPR, “which may have been received in the meantime from interested parties. In the latter cases, in order to facilitate the exercise of rights by the data subjects, the response must be provided in accordance with the timeframe and procedures set out” in Article 12(3) GDPR.

3) Designate within thirty days “a representative in the Italian territory to act as interlocutor, in addition to or instead of the data controller, with the interested parties in order to facilitate the exercise of their rights.”

4) Provide “adequately documented feedback, within thirty days of notification of this measure, of the initiatives taken to implement the above order” and “measures put in place to facilitate the exercise of the rights of the persons concerned.”

5) Pay a cumulative sum of €20,000,000  for violating Articles 5(1)(a), (b) and (e), 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 27 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 27"
"This case was initiated by a data breach notification reported by the Tuscany Region authorities to the Italian DPA (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali – Garante) on 30 July 2020. The breach involved the accidental disclosure of personal data belonging to approximately 3500  candidates participating in a public recruitment competition for administrative assistant job positions.

The Tuscany Region carrying out the contest (the data controller in this case) had a processing agreement with IT company Scanshare S.r.l. for the provision of services related to the organisation and management of the pre-selection phase. The IT company was tasked with processing the data necessary for the completion of the recruitment tests, as well as uploading these on to a server that would host the web page in which each candidate could consult their individual scores.

An email was sent by the processor to a candidate asking for information regarding the publication of the results, which mistakenly contained a link to the web application which was uploading the personal data related to the candidates and their scores, instead of the website where each candidate could log on to obtain their individual results.

The mistakenly sent link to the web application which contained the upload of the entire data set was subsequently circulated among other candidates. From this link, it was possible to access and download, inter alia, the name, surname, date of birth, tax code, detailed results of questionnaires, as well as the overall scores of all the participants. This data was exposed for approximately one hour until the data breach was discovered and remedied. The processor, without consulting the controller, then proceeded to subcontract an IT company named Hostinger, in order to provide it with the logs of the IP addresses which had unauthorised access to the data.

During the Garante’s investigation procedures, the processor claimed that this data breach was not of a malicious nature, and was instead due to a mistake by an employee, due to the fact that the link to website for the candidates, and the one to the web app for the upload of the entire data set, had the same name. It also stated the Hostinger, the third party they had subcontracted to investigate the data breach, in the end was not able to communicate the requested logs, and had no access whatsoever to the personal data and test scores contained on their servers, and hence should not be considered a sub-processor.","The Garante held that, in the present case, the personal data breach occurred for reasons mainly attributable to the processor, not the controller. In particular, the Garante noted the technical and organisational measures adopted by the processor were not adequate to the risks involved, which in turn led to the data breach. Therefore, the Garante held that the processor had not carried out its obligations related to the security of data processing under Article 32 GDPR.

Additionally, the Garante held that Hostinger, the third party sub-contracted by the processor to investigate the data breach, should be considered a sub-processor in this case. The Garante explained that although the sub-processor did not directly access the personal data contained in the processor’s website itself, it does however collect, record and store certain personal data such as the IP addresses of the device used by the user and the server hosting the website visited by the user, as well as the date and time of the connection. Therefore, the Garante subsequently held that this agreement was in violation of Article 28(2) GDPR, since it had not been authorised by the controller.

Based on these considerations, the Garante issued a fine of €10,000 against the processor (Scanshare S.r.l.) for the violation of Articles 32 and 28(2) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 32"
"This case was initiated by a data breach notification reported to the Italian DPA (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali – Garante), by a controller, which in this case was the local health authority of Melegnano e della Martesana (L’Azienda socio sanitaria territoriale Melegnano e della Martesana - A.S.S.T.). The data breach concerned the unauthorised disclosure of a medical report to a third party. The data breach did not involve the controller’s IT systems and infrastructures, and was instead due a mistake by an employee, which handed over the wrong physical paper copy of a medical report to another patient.

The controller explained to the Garante that it only became aware of the violation following a communication by the lawyer of the person to whom the aforementioned medical documentation had been mistakenly given to. The controller stated that they had subsequently asked this person to destroy any digital and paper copies that may have been made of it, and to not disclose the contents of the report to any third parties.

Additionally, the controller stated that it had notified the affected data subject that the data breach had occurred, and had also conducted an internal audit to determine the causes for the mistake, revising its internal procedures, and implementing further training courses focused on the correct management of documentation and health data.","The Garante held that the mistake by the employee had led to disclosing a data subject’s health data to a third party without a valid legal basis, in violation of Article 9 GDPR. Additionally, it held that the employee’s negligence also constituted a violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR on behalf of the controller, since it is responsible for processing personal data in such a way as to ensure security through appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to prevent unauthorised or unlawful processing.

However, the Garante acknowledged, as mitigating factors, that the health data breach was an isolated incident concerning only one data subject; that the controller had introduced measures to remedy the human error; that the controller had communicated the breach to the data subject as well as to the Garante; that there had been no data subject complaint related to the data breach; and that the controller had fully cooperated with the Garante during the investigation.

"A news company named G.O.L. Impresa Sociale S.r.l. published an article in the newspaper Open Online.it reporting on a news story involving the director of a high school (identified by her first name, last name and a photo) and an 18-year-old high school student (referred to by the initials of his first and last name), following the revelation of a love affair between the two, which is currently being investigated by the competent school offices. The article published excerpts of the messages allegedly exchanged between the director and the student related to details of the personal relations between them, placing a particular focus on the contents of these messages.

The story gained wide public notoriety in Italy, and prompted the Italian DPA (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali – Garante) to launch a preliminary investigation into the protection of the personal data of the persons mentioned in the news story, weighed against considerations regarding freedom of expression and information in the context of the journalistic activity carried out by the news company.","In its analysis of the case, the Garante took into consideration Article 9 GDPR, which establishes that data revealing a person’s sex life are special categories of personal data, and Article 85 GDPR, which establishes that Member States shall by law reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes.

The Garante also observed Article 137(3) of the Italian Data Protection Code (hereinafter the Code) which provides that the dissemination or communication of personal data for journalistic purposes can be limited in order to protect the rights mentioned in Article 1 of the Code (human dignity, fundamental rights and freedoms), and according to the essential nature of the information concerning facts of public interest.

The Garante also referred to Articles 5 and 6 of the Italian Deontological rules on the processing of personal data in the exercise of journalistic activity, which establish that when special categories of personal data are collected, including data revealing a person’s sexual sphere, journalists must guarantee that the right to information is based on essential facts of public interest, and that the disclosure of news of major public or social interest must be limited to what is indispensable in order to describe the facts.

The Garante held that the excessive focus on the details described and commented upon, related to the excerpts of the messages between the data subjects, added nothing with regard to the reporting and clarification of the matter, especially taking into consideration that investigations to determine the facts were currently ongoing.

Therefore, pursuant to its powers under Article 58(2)(f) GDPR, the Garante ordered the news company, in its capacity as data controller, to abide by a provisional order to cease any further dissemination of the content of the messages between the student and the director, as a matter of urgency in order to guarantee their confidentiality and dignity.

The Garante also held that the restriction shall take immediate effect as from the date of receipt of the decision, without prejudice to any other decision to be taken upon the outcome of the preliminary investigation into the case. Additionally, the Garante also ordered the news company to communicate what steps it had taken to implement the decision and to provide adequately documented feedback.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 58, Article 85"

According to the medical centre, two separate instances occurred where patients presented an application to acquire a copy of their respective medical records, but due to a mistake by the person in charge of preparing the copies and envelopes, two copies were made of the same medical records, and hence two of the patients received a copy belonging to the other two.

One of the patients which received the wrong medical record contacted the medical centre to inform them of the incident, and the medical centre prompted the patient to return the document, and upon doing so, to also issue a declaration in which he excluded further processing operations such as communication, dissemination and copying of the document. The medical centre also informed the Garante that their data protection official (DPO) also contacted the patient whose medical record was disclosed to the other by mistake, letting them know that the incident had taken place.

After this incident, the medical centre discovered a second incident, and got in contact with both parties in order to retrieve the document from one and get a declaration to exclude further processing, and to inform the patient of the incident and their actions to remedy it.","The Garante held that the medical centre’s disclosure of medical records to the wrong recipients constituted a violation the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, as well as the principle integrity and confidentiality pursuant to of Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(f) GDPR, as well as Article 9 GDPR related to the processing of special categories of personal data, and Article 32 GDPR on the security of processing. Based on these violations, the Garante issued a fine of €10,000 against the medical centre.

When determining the amount of the fine, the Garante took into consideration, as a mitigating factors, that the mistake was not intentional, and that the medical centre had adopted organizational measures to avoid such errors, including the training of personnel, the updating of operating instructions shared on the company intranet which include a double-check procedure when preparing the envelopes with medical records, as well as the establishment of a company working group on data protection composed of one or more representatives of each company department.

"The data controller used the whistleblowing application “WB confidential” for the organizational acquisition and management of reports on illegal conduct by its employees and other stakeholders. The application was operated by a SaaS supplier that acted as a processor for the controller in accordance with Article 28 GDPR.

The delivered reports could contain the identification data of the whistleblower, information relating to the report and any attached documentation. Due to the limited number of reports and data processed, however, the controller decided to not carry out an data protection impact assessment. Similarly, because of the “little use"" for any third parties and the ""extremely low probability of threats” the controller decided to not encrypt the personal data stored within its database and transmitted over the public network.

In motivating its decision, the controller held that adopting the measure of encryption was only applicable and adequate in cases of large volumes of processing data in specific subjective areas. The implementation of such a functionality had required the purchase of an additional component with disproportionate implementation costs. Also, technical access was reserved exclusively for the processor, who had no interest in communicating or disseminating any data.","The Italian DPA found that the controller is required to comply with the principle of integrity and confidentiality from Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. Accordingly, the data must be processed in a way that guarantees adequate security, including the protection from unauthorized processing, destruction or damage.

The Garante ruled the nature of the data exchanged and their possible acquisition by third parties as highly risky. In this regard, an unencrypted access to the system does not guarantee an adequate level of security. The data controller must implement adequate technical and organizational measures taking into account the state of the art, the nature, purposes and risks associated with the processing. This includes the use of cryptographic tools for both the transport and storage of data as well conducting an impact assessment on data protection. Until the adoption of these measures, the processing carried out is in violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 25(1) GDPR, Article 32 GDPR and Article 35 GDPR.

"The company 'aiComply Srl' (the ‘Processor’) provided the Airport of Bologna (the ‘Controller’) with the whistleblowing application “WB confidential” for the organizational acquisition and management of reports on illegal conduct by its employees and other stakeholders. The processor further offered maintenance of the application through two other companies, ‘Agic Technology Srl’ carrying specialist assistance activities and ‘A1Tech Srl’ carrying out the management of the IT-infrastructure.

Investigations of the DPA found, that personal data transferred and stored within the application was not encrypted. Furthermore, it was verified that all three processing companies shared a non-nominal “System-Administrator” profile for the application. In this regard, aiComply had never informed the airport about this relationship with the two sub-processors.

aiComply argued, that suitable security measures and especially encryption, had not be considered due to an extraordinarily limited amount of processing relating to only few reports transmitted through the system. Accordingly, the application was sufficiently protected by a firewall and an only internal or VPN access. It was negotiated with the airport that no further security measures shall be adopted. The processor also argued, that both involved companies for the maintenance did not process any personal data due to carrying out only technical activities and were generally appointed as suppliers of system administration tasks by aiComply.","The DPA decided that both the controller and the processor are obliged to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security within their scope and competencies. The missing encryption and sharing of a non-nominal ‘Admin-User’ with two other companies therefore lack the implementation of such adequate safeguards and violate Article 32 GDPR.

"The GPDP launched an investigation into the parking meters operated by the Municipality of Rome. According to a report, users had to enter the license plate of their vehicle to obtain the parking ticket.

It found some parking meters under management had recently been modernised to allow card payments and the personalisation of payments to stop users of the service from needing to display tickets. The latter required users to enter their license plates into the meters. The system underpinning this was operated by Atac s.p.a. The company collected information (e.g. the time, the start and end date of the stop, the amount paid and the license plate) relating to the payment of the parking, which was facilitated by more intermediary companies, and made it available both to traffic auxiliaries for the purposes of verifying the payment of the parking as well as to the company's internal staff for administrative management purposes.

The DPA notified Roma Capitale that it had discovered some breaches and invited the municipality to produce defensive writings. It stated that the municipality had effectively put in place a system that (1) processed the personal data collected through the new parking meters installed in the area (2) without providing data subjects adequate information, (3) without defining the roles of the external companies involved in the processing, (4) without defining the storage times of the data collected and (5) without having adopted appropriate security measures, in violation of Articles 5, 12, 13, 25, 28 and 32 GDPR.","The GPDP held that Roma Capitale unlawfully carried out the the processing of personal data.

It is still not clear whether the breaches were directly caused by the partner's employees or the mentioned credentials had been stolen and used by an external third party.","Although the bank noted that a particular effort was made in the security field, the Garante highlighted that the breaches occurred due to a lack of security measures in place adopted by Unicredit on the implementation of 'Speedy Arena' and a lack of proper access control, level of permission and authorization given to the employees of the financial partner, Penta Finanziamenti Italia S.r.l.. The Garante noted the absence of specific control by the bank over the work of the financial partner, which potentially had the chance to have access to a large amount of information by only using the file number of the bank customer.

Secondly, the bank did not properly follow the Guidelines specifically designed for the banking sector, which explicitly requires banks to track and retain all of the logs related to banking transactions of the customers' files and to keep them at least for 24 months.

"The Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali, Italy’s DPA, led an investigation into Vodafone Italy S.p.A following various complaints by Vodafone users and non-users, which highlighted multiple issues on the phone company’s practices.

The first group of claimants complained about constant unwanted promotional phone calls and SMS from Vodafone, with one example being a person claiming that they have been receiving at least 4/5 messages a month by Vodafone since 2018, even after he communicated to the company that he no longer wanted to receive such messages. Vodafone blamed this last mishap on a “system error” that failed to register the client’s request to stop the promotional messages.

The second set of complaints concerned the way that the company stored their client’s data. More specifically, costumers complained about being approached by Vodafone operators, usually after reporting issues with their internet service. However, it turned out that those were call-centres that worked for other phone companies or third party callers that used Vodafone’s logo in their WhatsApp profile. These unauthorized individuals would often ask about the issues the users reported, point out that Vodafone would increase their costumer service fees and offer to subscribe the user to a different phone provider. Other times, they would just request for the user’s IDs, possibly for fraudulent or phishing purposes. Vodafone claimed to have been aware of these practices in the past, confirmed that those were indeed unauthorized parties under false pretences, and explained that they were trying to improve security on their databases by applying 2 Factor Authentication.

Lastly, several users complained that Vodafone was not responding appropriately to their requests in exercise of their rights under Articles 15-22 GDPR. For example, one user complained that Vodafone had not replied at all to a request sent to them via email. Another one explained that Vodafone did reply, but did not promptly correct the user’s personal information as requested, therefore breaching Article 16 GDPR. A last user complained that Vodafone refused to provide the client with information about the purposes of processing his personal data under Article 15(1) because he did not provide them with appropriate Identification, as he used a document with a digital signature.","In light of these facts, Italy’s DPA found Vodafone S.p.A in violation of the following GDPR provisions:

Article 5(1) and Article 5(2) and Article 25(1): for failing to implement control systems of the personal data collection databases from the first time that they received clients’ complaints, in order to exclude with certainty that services or subscriptions were activated on Vodafone’s databases through illicit or unwanted calls by unrecognized third parties.

Article 5(1), Article(2), Article 6(1) and Article 7, because Vodafone received personal data lists by business partners, that those had received from third parties, this all without the user’s appropriate consent. This affected 4,500,000 people in 2019.

Violation of Article 5, Article 6 , Article 7 and Article 21 , due to many complaints of undesired contacts from Vodafone through phone call and SMS, that Vodafone blamed on human errors or system errors that were not documented, even following the data subject used their right to object to processing.

Violation of Article 24 and Article 32, due to the constant access to databases containing personal data, including full names, phone numbers, phone usage details and payment details. For failing to place appropriate measures to guarantee, or be able to prove, that processing of that data was done in compliance with GDPR and ensuring security and integrity of the data processing techniques used and verify the efficacy of the technical and organisational measures in place to guarantee security of processing.

The system acquired and stored on the servers of the Municipality for a long period of time, numerous users' personal data relating to reservations (type of service, channel used, date and time of the reservation) and of the staff employed in the management of appointments.

The system also recorded and generated daily reports containing detailed information of the work activity (date, type of service, name of the counter attendant, call time and waiting time).

"The case involves the processing of citizens’ health data by Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale Toscana Sud Est (hereafter simply ‘USL’), a local public health body, as part of a broader initiative from Tuscany Region related to the monitoring of chronic diseases in the population. The facts – as emerged from an initial notice received from a general practitioner (hereafter ‘GP’), the following investigation from the Italian DPA, and the information provided by the public body – read as follows.

In the context of the above-mentioned public health approach, health data was shared among several public healthcare stakeholders, including general practitioners (GPs) and public clinics, coordinated by the USL. Initially, GPs sent to the USL only aggregated data pertaining to specific diseases. Until 2018, however, the USL asked GPs to fill in an Excel file with the names of the patients and their pathologies. After having gathered patients’ consent, GPs filled in the file, embedded it in a password-protected zip archive, and shared it with ‘district physicians’ via a USB drive stick. The file was then copied on the district physician’s PC and sent via email to a district physician who is competent for the whole area, who eventually sent it via the same mean to an administrative body named ‘ESTAR’. ESTAR is a data processor which manages a ‘data warehouse’ and makes data form the program available to the USL, for monitoring purposes, via a ‘data mart’. Before entering the data warehouse, data were pseudonymised using an existing regional identifier.","As a result of the investigation, the Garante found several violations of the GDPR.

Firstly, the USL had not documented its processing activities as required by Article 30 GDPR, despite the two years between the adoption of the GDPR and its coming into force.

Secondly, the legal designation of ESTAR as data processor was not clear and detailed enough to be compliant with Article 28 GDPR (nor with 29 of the Italian ‘Privacy Code’ implementing the Data Protection Directive, which was in force at the time of the initial designation).

Thirdly, the process for the collection of data from GPs did not provide for sufficient technical and organisational measures, and was not designed following a risk-based approach. According to the Garante, the means used to gather and share data across the different stakeholders did not follow the security principles as per Article 5(1)(f) GDPR (ed.: the decision actually reads 5(2)(f)), highlighting ‘the absence of an assessment of the risks related to the data processing that should have been carried out in the context of the impact assessment, which does not appear to have been carried out’.

Moreover, the information given to data subjects was lacking ‘some of the essential elements required by the regulation’ as per Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, such as: data retention periods, information about data subjects’ rights, contact data of data controller and data processor, a clear description of the data processing and the legal basis for the data processing. Again, the Italian DPA stressed that such requirements preceded the entry into force of the GDPR.

Finally, the Garante found that, despite the nature of the data processed and the number of data subjects involved, no DPIA was carried out for the data processing, and that this is to be considered particularly critical as ‘some evident shortcomings concerning the adoption of adequate security measures could have been avoided if the risk of processing had been adequately assessed.’

The Italian DPA then declared the processing carried out by the USL unlawful ‘on the ground that it infringes Articles 5(2)(f), 13, 14, 28, 30, 32 and 35 of the Regulation.’

Since the beginning of the investigation, the USL proceeded to correct the violations of articles 13, 14, 28, and 30. Given this, and the fact that it also went back to gather only anonymous data from GPs, the Garante found that ‘the conditions for the adoption of the corrective measures referred to in Article 58(2) of the Regulation are not met’. The Authority then imposed an administrative fine to the USL as per Articles 83(5)(b) and 83(4)(a) GDPR.

The elements considered to determine the amount of the fine are the following: the fact that the Garante only received one report about the infringement, and that no data breach was reported; the fact that the data processing involved health data; the lack of risk-assessment, security measures, and records of processing activities, which are part of the accountability principle as per Article 5(2) GDPR; the fact that the USL showed ‘a high degree of cooperation’; the fact that regional authorities initiated a process to properly regulate the whole health care initiative. For these reasons, the Garante found an administrative fine of 100,000 Euros to be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. Finally, the DPA stated that ‘in quantifying the fine, the Garante took into particular consideration the fact that the violations are connected to a processing operation that started shortly before the definitive application of the Regulation.’

Interestingly, despite having found violations of several articles, the Garante stated that the fine was due to the violation of ‘Articles 13 and 28 GDPR.’",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 14, Article 28, Article 30, Article 35, Article 83"
"Following a data breach notification from ARPAC, the Italian DPA started a proceeding aimed at checking the security measures implemented by the notifier.","The Italian DPA found that the violation of personal data was due to the lack of an adequate security framework in line with art. 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR. More specifically: (i) no backup or disaster recovery plan to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner; (ii) no measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality of data subjects' identity, and (iii) no process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

Therefore, the Italian DPA fined ARPAC for not complying with art. 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR. However, given the initiatives adopted by ARPAC to mitigate the risk of new breaches, the fine was of EUR 8,000 only.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"Following some news in 2019 about the adoption of a system based on biometric data to detect employees' attendance, the Garante started an investigation upon the Provincial Health Department (ASP) in Enna. According to the ASP:

(a) the collection of biometrics did not consist of personal data processing, since it begins (in an automated manner) if and when (and only when) the employee initiates the process himself by carrying out two material operations that are under his personal and exclusive control (placing the badge on the reader and placing of the fingertip on the scanner);

(b) ASP informed employees of the adoption of this measure to detect attendance and the relevant collection of biometric data;

(c) the processing was based on employees' consent and following the prescriptions of Law n. 56/2019 aimed at preventing absenteeism on the workplace.","The Italian DPA rejected the arguments of APS upholding that:

(a) ASP - even though it did not store the biometric data of the data subjects on a centralised database, but only on portable devices with adequate cryptographic capabilities (badges with smart card functions), entrusted to the direct and exclusive availability of each data subject - nevertheless carried out the processing of biometric data which (as confirmed by ASP itself) are collected - albeit for a very short amount of time -  within the system used to record attendance. This applies both in the enrollment stage (with the acquisition of the fingerprints), and the recognition phase (when detecting employees' attendance);

(b) employees were not duly informed according to the essential details required by art. 13 GDPR;

(c) the processing did not rely on adequate legal basis, as consent is not valid in the employment context because of the imbalance in the relationship between employee and employer.

Following the findings of the DPA, ASP has stopped the collection of employees' biometric data. However, there is no evidence of the fact that fingerprint already stored as a biometric template in the badges issued to staff have been deleted.

"The inquiry from the Garante originated from a data breach notification received by Azienda USL della Romagna on 19 December 2019, for a violation occurred on 1 March 2019 of which the health care provider officially became aware on 17 December 2019. This was only after the data subject claimed for damages, and the provider carried out an internal inquiry.

As the patient was admitted to the gynaecology ward, she asked that no information related to her health status be revealed to any third party. For this purpose, she provided a personal phone number. After her discharge, a tried to contact her in order to give her information about a treatment, but used a different phone number found on the front page of the patient’s medical record, and hence found herself talking to her husband. The information disclosed to the patient's husband only concerned the type of ward to which the patient was admitted.

During the DPA’s investigation, the provider disclosed that the nurse had been formally authorised to process personal data, and she was provided with operating instructions to properly process personal data. Additionally, the USL presented that the procedure to record the health data of the patient was not computerised. Hence, although the form signed by the data subject and containing her refusal to provide information about her health to third parties was included in the medical record, the medical record itself showed on the front page a telephone number that the patient had given to the provider before her hospitalization.

Concerning the data breach itself, the USL reported that the nurse should have communicated with the patient in person at the hospital, right after her release, but she was interrupted by a call from another patient and hence asked the data subject to wait. After having found out that the patient actually left the hospital, the nurse then quickly tried to contact the patient, finding in the company registry the telephone number to contact her.","Following its investigation, the Garante held that “the processing of personal data carried out by Azienda USL della Romagna in the terms set out in the grounds is unlawful, due to the breach of Articles 5(1)(a), (d) and (f), 9 and 32(1)(b) GDPR.” Pursuant to Article 58(2)(i), the DPA hence imposed an administrative fine as per Article 83(4) and (5) GDPR. Given that the conduct had exhausted its effects, and that the USL was implementing new technical and organisational measures deemed adequate to solve the issue that brought to the data breach, the Garante found that no corrective measure was applicable to the case at hand.

Concerning the administrative fine of € 50 000, the Garante explained that the elements taken into account to decide its amount were the following:

* the significant detrimental impact and serious unlawfulness of the processing;
* the fact that the processing involved health data;
* the fact that the conduct is attributable to the USL fault;
* the “reinforced system of safeguards” provided by Italian law in cases of voluntary termination of pregnancy;
* the data subject was in a particularly vulnerable position;
* the DPA was informed about the breach by the provider itself;
* the infringement involved a single data subject;
* the USL implemented new technical and organisational measures, and a policy, to solve the issue;
* the fact that the USL was “extremely cooperative”;
* the absence of wilful misconduct;
* the fact that there was no previous relevant infringement committed by the USL and no measure had been previously ordered pursuant to Article 58 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83"
"Following some reports, the Italian DPA ascertained that the MISE uploaded on its website a list of more than 5,000 managers containing their personal data, including name, tax code, e-mail address, CV, mobile phone and, in some cases, ID and health card. All this data was freely visible and downloadable. The MISE published that list to help SMEs in booking advice from experienced business professionals on the technological and digital processes to manage vouchers provided in compliance with the 2019 Budget Law.

Furthermore, it has found that there was no adequate legal basis for the online publication of managers' personal data, as there were less intrusive methods to ensure that SMEs would have access to the managers' consultancy services, such as ensuring restricted access to said information through the use of passwords and usernames. As such, the Authority found that the dissemination of their personal information also consisted of disproportionate processing of data.

During the second phase assessment, the INPS checked whether between the requests there were parliamentarians or holders of offices in public administrations. To do so, INPS collected some personal data from open source registers and generated from this open data the personal tax code of the applicants and compared it with the one in the application. This way of calculation of the tax code can entail some mistakes. The secondary examination was carried on also for the subjects to which the aid was already been refused under the first examination. Only afterwards, the Labour ministry declared that parliamentarians and holders of administrative office would be excluded from this financial aid.","The DPA found that the fact that the second examination on parliamentarians and holders of administrative offices has been carried out before the note of Labour ministry on the exclusion of these categories from the financial aid, comported a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency as per Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

The fact that the processing was not limited to who received the aid but included who had already been refused, was in violation of the principle of adequacy and minimisation as per Artcle 5(1)(c) GDPR.

The fact that the tax code has been generated from open data and not obtain by official sources and thus potentially erroneous, was violating the principle of adequacy as per Article 5(1)(d) GDPR.

The DPA also considered that all the previous violations constituted together the violation of privacy by default and by design as per Article 25 GDPR and the liability principle of 5(2) GDPR.

The DPA finally found out that the provision on impact assessment, as per Article 35 GDPR was also violated because the INPS has not adequately weighed the existence of a high risk, such as to require the conduct of a preliminary impact assessment on data protection, and has not adequately involved the DPO.

"Following hundreds of complaints for continuous and insistent unwanted telephone calls from Fastweb with the aim of promoting its offers, the Italian DPA opened an Investigation.

The Garante found out firstly, that a large part of the telephone numbers selected came from abusive call centers that process personal data without respecting GDPR. Secondly, the Garante found out a wrongful management of contact lists, provided to Fastweb by external partners, without the latter having acquired the free, specific and informed consent of data subjects to the processing of their data. Thirdly, the Garante also noted the absence of adequate security measures for customer management systems. In fact, many users reported that they had been contacted by false Fastweb operators probably for the purpose of spamming, phishing and for carrying out other fraudulent activities. Other critical issues were found by the Guarantor in the promotional activity carried out by Fastweb in partnership with another party (e.g. Eni Gas e Luce S.p.A.) for using customer lists provided by the latter without consent to the marketing activity. Other violations concerned procedures adopted for the “Call me back” service, which prevented users from giving free, specific and informed consent and from deactivating the service in an automated manner.","The Garante ascertained the violation of:

1. Violation of articles 5(1) and (2), 6(1), 7, 24 and 25(1) GDPR, since Fastweb has not proceeded to implement control systems of the ""chain"" of collection of personal data suitable to exclude with certainty that illegal or unwanted promotional calls have been followed by activations of services or signing of contracts which are then merged into the Fastweb databases.

2. Violation of articles 5(1) and (2), 6(1), and 7 GDPR, since Fastweb S.p.A. acquired lists of personal data from third parties who, in turn, had acquired them as independent data controllers and who have transferred them to Fastweb systems. The data transfer to Fastweb has occurred in the absence of the prescribed consent for the communication of personal data between independent data controllers.

3. Violation of Articles 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 21 GDPR in relation to the methods of activation, release of the information and revocation of the ""Call me back"" service.

4. Violation of Articles 24 and 32 GDPR, in relation to the multiple and systematic accesses to corporate databases containing personal data for failing to implement measures of proportionate effectiveness to guarantee, and be able to demonstrate, that the processing is carried out in accordance with the Regulation, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the systems and services on a permanent basis.

"In July 2020, an individual sent an e-mail to the Hellenic DPA reporting that when they attempted to submit an application on the tourism4all.gov.gr platform, they discovered a personal data breach. Indeed, when they entered their credential the application data of a third party (not related to the complainant) which included his full name, Tax Identification Number, Social Security Number (SSN), postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and disability status all appeared.

Additionally, when the individual tried to find the Ministry of Tourism's Data Protection Officer to inform them of this issue, they found it did not have one - in contravention of Article 31(1) and (7) GDPR. Thus, the Hellenic DPA launched an investigation to determine whether the Ministry of Tourism contravened Articles 33, 34 and 37 GDPR.","First, the Ministry of Tourism argued that whilst it is the data controller of the platform, its involvement was not of a technical nature because it was the obligation of the contractor it hired to design to ensure the platform's proper functioning and to take all necessary security measures to safeguard users' personal data.

In addition, it argued that because the incident in question was isolated, dealt with immediately, and the personal data was not widely exposed, the affected person was not put at risk. As such, in the Ministry's view, it was not possible to consider that it contravened Articles 33 and 34 GDPR.

Finally, the Ministry of Tourism asserted that it believed that it was actually the Ministry of Digital Governance's responsibility to ""operate"" the dpo@mintour.com email address, as it had not instructed the contractor to use this email address.

However, the Hellenic DPA held that the Ministry of Tourism was responsible for the processing on the platform. This was evidenced in a Joint Ministerial Decision which explicitly stated the Ministry of Tourism was the controller of any users of the platform's personal data. As such, it was liable under the GDPR for the data breach and lack of a DPO.

Further, the DPA determined that an 'ad hoc' incident response procedure was followed following the data breach. This procedure failed to uncover the source of the incident, and even after investigating the different parties questioned could only speculate as to the cause of the incident. The DPA held this constituted ""a breach of the fundamental requirements to take appropriate organisational and technical measures to security of processing, in accordance with Article 32 GDPR, in connection with Article 24 GDPR, as the controller did not take into account the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons in determining security measures.""

Finally, the DPA held that the Ministry of Tourism violated Article 33 GDPR by failing to report the aforementioned data breach, and Article 37(1) GDPR by not appointing a DPO (at the time the breach took place).

"Due to COVID-19 pandemic period, the Hellenic Ministry of Education and Religions Affairs (the Ministry) decided to promote and implement a method of distance learning by technological means for students in primary and secondary education. The Greek DPA (HDPA) considered this method legal, but found that the Ministry had failed to consider a number of factors and risks in relation to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects when conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Recognizing the need for the contemporary distance education, the HDPA provided an opinion to the Ministry to address the flaws and shortcomings. The HDPA called on the Ministry to make the appropriate changes to the DPIA within an exclusive period of three months. After that period, the HDPA analyzed once again the measures taken by the Ministry to assess whether the adopted method of distance learning and the measures that accompanied it complied with the GDPR.","The HDPA examined the updated DPIA, as well as the compliance actions taken by the Ministry. The HDPA identified deficiencies as follows: first of all, the HDPA found that the Ministry never made a detailed investigation on the lawfulness of the processing purposes under Article 6(4) GDPR, in particular with regard to the consent for access to information stored in a user's terminal equipment, when is not necessary to provide the service requested by the user.

Regarding the principle of transparency and the right to access by the data subject, according to Article 12 and 14 GDPR, the information provided by the Ministry to the data subjects was not considered appropriate and sufficient. The HDPA found in particular that the provided information was not easy to understand and (lack of accessibility and of clear and simple wording), especially vis-à-vis children.

The HDPA further found that the applied measures, despite having been improved, still needed to be completed, in order to ensure in particular that all the teachers involved in the distance education process receive minimal information in accordance with Article 13 GDPR.

In addition, the HDPA found that the Ministry violated the obligation of Article 35(9) GDPR in relation to the expression of opinion of the data subjects or their representatives for the processing activity.

Last but not least, no proper evaluation of data transfer to non-EU countries were carried out and in particular in the light of the CJEU judgment in Case C-311/18 (Schrems II).

The purpose of this was to avoid these deals, which primarily existed to attract new customers, from becoming unprofitable.

Neither first time nor existing customers were adequately informed of this data reconciliation and its ultimate purpose.","The inquiry did not deal with the question whether the data reconciliation was permissible. The €901,388 fine was only imposed for not sufficiently informing the customers about this processing activity.

The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information held that the fine was appropriate because of the large number of affected customers, but should be reduced in light of the cooperation by the company and because it stopped the non-transparent data reconciliation immediately after the first action by the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 13"

"On 27 December 2019, the UK Cabinet Office (department of the Government of the United Kingdom) published the content page of the New Years 2020 Honours List on its website. The content page contained a link to a CSV file version of the Honours list that was not adequately edited to remove personal data. The CSV file contained the postal address of Honours recipients in a column that had been “hidden” rather than completely “deleted” from the CSV file. Despite the various steps taken before publishing the CSV file, no one within the Cabinet Office teams working on the Honours List noticed that the column was only “hidden”. The column was still there and became apparent again once the CSV file was made available online on gov.uk.

The Cabinet Office was alerted of the data breach by a member of the Government Communications Team. The Cabinet Office then republished the content page without the link to the CSV file. However, anyone who had the exact URL to the CSV file already could still access it despite this change. This is because documents cannot be removed from the gov.uk website once they have been published.

The issue was escalated and eventually the CSV file was permanently deleted around 2 hours and 30 minutes after it was first made available. It was found that the CSV file was accessed 3872 times from 2798 IP addresses.

The Cabinet Office alerted affected data subjects within 48 hours of the data breach and submitted a Personal Data Breach Report to the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.

The Cabinet Office confirmed there was no written process in place to approve documents containing personal data prior to being published to ensure the content was suitably redacted. Additionally, the Cabinet Office’s page for best practice on data handling had not been updated for six months despite the implementation of a new software used to produce the Honours List (which contained a column for addresses). There were various other security concerns identified in an independent review commissioned by the Cabinet Office (accessibility of data to team members that do not need to have access; lack of testing of software to ensure they are robust enough; lack of monitoring of training for staff).","The United Kingdom Data Protection Authority (ICO) held that the Cabinet Office had contravened Article 5(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when erroneously publishing the CSV file containing the data subjects’ postal addresses.

The ICO also considered that the Cabinet Office had infringed Article 32(1) GDPR as it did not have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure an appropriate level of security.

The ICO investigated the Exemption within Paragraph 15(1) of Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act 2018, which excludes the application of various rights and obligations to personal data processed for the purposes of conferring an honour or dignity (given by the Government under the name “the Crown”). Article 5 is listed as a provision that the data controller would not have to comply if the exemption applied. However, the ICO deemed that this did not apply as the contravention of Article 5(1)(f) as the erroneous publication of addresses was a result of a data security incident (rather than rights and obligations).

The ICO considered that a monetary penalty was appropriate given:

* the number of individuals affected;
* the damage or harm (eg distress and/or embarrassment); and 
* failure to apply reasonable technical and organisational measures to mitigate any breach

It also considered the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement. Despite the short time frame of availability (2.5 hours), there was a substantial amount of views (3872 times) and the Honours List was a high-profile event that attracts interest. The ICO also considered that the address of high profile people was disclosed as a result. The ICO highlighted that the breach caused distress to some of the affected individuals (3 complaints were received from affected data subjects)

The ICO considered the fact that the infringement was negligent. Staff members had been given verbal reminders to remove personal data from files, but there was no written process on how to remove said personal data. There was also no specific approval process in place to ensure personal data was adequately removed from documents intended for publication.

The ICO identified steps taken by the controller to mitigate damage suffered by data subjects. This included:

* removing the CSV file completely after 2.5 hours; 
* 2.5 hours was a short time frame for accessibility; and 
* most access occurred prior to the CSV file being completely deleted (when just the link was removed). This indicated that the first steps taken by the Cabinet Office were generally successful, even if the CSV file was still technically accessible in other ways. 

The Cabinet Office also took steps to inform data subjects within 48 hours of the breach and ensured that the Police took steps to assess the risk of the affected data subjects. The ICO found that the Cabinet Office took steps to prevent further dissemination of the data, for example by ensuring screenshots of the List posted on Twitter were removed.

The ICO also highlighted the steps taken by the Cabinet Office to reduce the likelihood of similar events occurring in the future. For example, reviewing technical processes, issuing guidance on removing personal data, providing training sessions to staff members, engaging in an independent review of data handling policies, processes, practice and culture.

Additionally, the ICO found that the data breach stemmed from a build error of the new software used to produce the Honours List. This generated the list to include postal address data in error. Accordingly, the Cabinet Office was responsible for the breach as the Digital and Technology team built the system. Lack of training and guidance available for staff members, including those in the Digital team, was also an important factor.

The ICO therefore imposed a fine of approximately €585,739 on the Cabinet Office as an effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalty.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33"
"DialADeal Scotland Ltd is an organisation listed as a ""business and domestic software development"" company on the Companies House records.

It used a 'spoofed' number to make a total of 1,376,255 direct marketing calls from August 2019 to March 2020, which led to the ICO receiving 213 complaints. One third of the recipients of these calls were made to users registered with the TPS, a register of numbers allocated to subscribers who have notified the ICO that they do not wish to receive unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes. The calls related to non-existent ""Green Deal"" government energy saving schemes.

In response to an investigation letter sent to the home address of one of the company's two directors, he sent an email stating it did not engage in any of such activities. The ICO was not convinced.","The Commissioner held that DialADeal Scotland Ltd contravened Regulations 21 and 24 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003. The recipients of the direct marketing calls it made were registered with the TPS and had not given their prior consent to receive them.

The infringement was serious because the company actively took steps to prevent recipients from contacting it, failed to identify itself on the calls and provided false generic company names. It was also deliberate or negligent because the direct marketing calls were made about government schemes that did not exist and the ICO received a high number of complaints regarding them.

As a result, the ICO issued a fine of €176,000 (£150,000).",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4
"Emailmovers Limited (EML) advertises its services, such as email data, email cleansing, email marketing, etc...). It has a database of data subjects' email addresses. On its website, it claims that it has a ""GDPR and PECR [Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003] compliant email database"". The data was received from an unamed organisation that collected the individual's personal data and mentioned that it may be shared with third parties for marketing purposes.

In 2018, EML was investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). EML provided the ICO enforcement team with 7000 records of personal data (names, dates of birth, postcodes, phone numbers, email addresses).

Emailmovers Limited claimed to be a data processor rather than a controller to the ICO. It claimed so on the basis that it processed data subjects' personal data on behalf of business clients that it had. It also relied on a  document (""Legal and Commercial Terms for  the Supply of Commercial and Personal Data"") where it classified itself as a processor to its business clients.","The Information Commissioner's Office first established that Emailmovers Limited (EML) was a data controller by virtue of the definition in Article 4(7) GDPR. First, the ICO highlighted that EML's ""Legal and Commercial Terms..."" points to the fact that EML decided who it supplied the personal data to. Additionally, the ICO found that EML determined the purposes of processing the personal data when deciding whether to disclose the database to certain business clients. EML also had broad discretion over how the data is created, stored and manipulated. The ICO also clarified that the fact that the ""Legal and Commercial Terms..."" document specified that EML was a processor is not conclusive. Instead, one must rely on the definition of controller found in Article 4(7) GDPR. The ICO concluded that EML determines the purposes and means of processing and is as such a data controller.

The ICO considered that EML has processed personal data in a manner that is not fair, lawful nor transparent. It is therefore in violation of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR. The ICO concluded that EML did not identify a lawful basis to engage in business to consumer marketing, presumably because EML argued to be a processor. The only possible lawful basis that could have be relied upon is consent according to evidence provided by EML. However, the ICO is not satisfied that consent would have been effectively collected.

The ICO found that the privacy policy of the organisation that collected the personal data, despite stating that individual's personal data would be shared with third parties for marketing purposes, was not specific enough. It did not clearly name the third party recipients.

The ICO highlighted the requirements for consent, including that it need to be ""specific and informed"". It specified that consent for purchased ""consented"" data is valid only where the purchaser is identified at the time of collection of the data (at the point where consent was given). Therefore, EML could not have purchased the data on the basis of valid consent as a lawful basis as it was not identified as a potential buyer to individuals.

Additionally, EML did not process personal data in a transparent way as individuals were not aware EML was processing their data and EML's clients were not identified to data subjects either.

Therefore, the ICO found EML in violation of Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR. The ICO therefore requires that EML complies with the following within three months:

* notify individuals whose personal data was or is processed by EML the purposes of processing, the legal basis, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of this data (Article 14 GDPR); 
* cease to process personal data of data subject to whom information notices mentioned in the point above have not been sent to; 
* cease to process personal data obtained on the (alleged) basis of consent; and 
* ensure that appropriate records of consent are kept. 

Compliance with the ICO's notice would remedy the violation in the ICO's view and a fine may be imposed if it is not.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5"
"HIV Scotland is a charity that helps people living with HIV, those at risk of HIV and individuals that support people with HIV. HIV Scotland got a MailChimp account for the purpose of online mailing and migrated contact details to the bulk mailing platform. A list of contact details of the Community Advisory Network (CAN) was not migrated.

On 3 Feburary 2020, an email was sent using Microsoft Outlook to 105 members of CAN in CC rather than BCC. This meant that email addresses of 65 recipients were apparent, identifying the individual by name.

HIV Scotland noticed the error instantly and submitted a breach report, highlighting that individuals' HIV statuses could be deduced from this breach. HIV Scotland contacted the individuals to apologise and offered support if distress was caused.

HIV Scotland has since implemented MailChimp for all its mailing operations to reduce the risk of a repeat incident.","The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) conclude that HIV Scotland failed to set up appropriate organisational and technical measures. The following steps taken by HIV Scotland prior to the breach were insufficient according to the ICO:

* Employees asked to read and refer to HIV Scotland's privacy policy
* Training on GDPR awareness in the first three months of employment
* Awareness of the BCC requirement for group emails
* Attempt to migrate contact details to MailChimp for better security.

The ICO found following deficiencies in the technical and organisational measures at HIV Scotland.

* HIV Scotland did not have a specific internal Policy for handling personal data securely. Reliance on the external Privacy Policy was not an appropriate data protection policy for staff handling personal data. 
* The staff did not have guidance on how to handle personal data securely. According to the ICO, employees should have had GDPR training prior to handling personal data and within one month of their start data. This is especially required when staff handle special category data.  
* It was revealed during the investigation that the charity was aware of the poor data storage for 10 months prior to the breach. The move to MailChimp was an attempt to rectify this, however this was not adequately implemented between July 2019 and the day of the breach, 3 February 2020. According to the ICO, a correct and full implementation MailChimp would have prevented the disclosure of personal data. 

The ICO clarified that although only email addresses were apparent, the special category data of 65 identified individuals could be inferred to a reasonable degree (HIV status).

The ICO deemed that HIV Scotland was fully aware of the risk of its practices, having criticised another controller for having suffered a similar error 6 months before HIV Scotland's own personal data breach.

The ICO concluded that HIV Scotland infringed Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR by sending bulk emails rather than separate emails to each intended recipient. Additionally, it found that in addition to failing to fully migrate to MailChimp, HIV Scotland failed to use BCC in Microsoft Outlook.

The ICO also concluded that HIV Scotland infringed Articles 32(1) and (2) of the GDPR by failing to have a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing. The ICO particularly highlighted the awareness within HIV Scotland that their practices prior to the breach were deficient.

When assessing the level of the fine, the ICO considered certain factors, such as:

* the fact that the breach of personal data would at least cause an element of distress for the individuals;
* the fact that the breach was negligent due to HIV Scotland's awareness that Outlook was not secure for sensitive communications and that HIV Scotland had criticised another controller for a similar error; 
* the fact that HIV Scotland should have been aware of previous fines by the ICO regarding similar breaches and in any case were aware of the deficiencies of their own technical and organisational measures;
* the fact that special category data (HIV status) could be reasonably inferred as a result of the breach;
* the fact that HIV Scotland took steps to mitigate the damage suffered by individuals;
* the fact that HIV Scotland didn't have prior data protection infringements;
* the fact that HIV Scotland cooperated with the ICO; and 
* the fact that HIV Scotland reported the breach to the ICO within 2 hours of the incident.

The ICO then went to impose a fine of approximately €12000 on HIV Scotland.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"Mermaids is a registered charity supporting children, young people and their families in relation to gender non-conformity.

In 2016, Mermaids created an internet-based email group service at https://groups.io, overseen by a third party in the USA. This email group was intended to be shared between the CEO of Mermaids and 12 trustees. The default security and privacy settings were left in place, including ""Group listed in directory, publicly viewable messages"".

Mermaids was notified in 2019 by a user of the charity that internal emails, sent using the groups.io email group service, were publicly available online and were searchable through search engines. These contained personal data, including special category data. The service user, who's child is gender non-conforming, was made aware that her child's name, date of birth, mental and physical health were available online, as well as the mother's name, telephone number and address.

Overall, 780 pages of confidential emails were available online. This corresponded to 550 data subjects. 15 data subjects had special category data concerning them made available online (mental or physical health; sex life; sexual orientation) and 9 data subject's personal data was considered sensitive in the context. Of these 24 data subjects, 4 were 13 years old or under.

Mermaids notified the ICO on the day it was told about this.","The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) considered that Mermaids processed emails on an email group without appropriate restricted access settings. Due to this failure, third parties could gain unauthorised access to emails containing personal data, including special category data. The ICO deemed this in contravention of the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR).

The ICO also considered that Mermaids failed to satisfy its obligations under Articles 32(1) and 32(2) GDPR. It did not have adequate security measures in place to protect the email group affected. As a consequence, special category data was publicly accessible online for over a year between 2018 and 2019.

The ICO considered various factors that aggravated the violation in order to assess whether a penalty was appropriate. Accordingly, the ICO highlighted the sensitive nature of the publicly available personal data (special category data: gender and health data). It also assessed the gravity of the matter. In relation to this, it deemed that Mermaids' failures increased the vulnerability of the people who's special category data and personal data was made publicly available. The risk of damage or distress for gender non-conforming children was considered particularly high due to discrimination and prejudice. The ICO also took into consideration the types and number of data subjects (some children) affected and the fact that this concerned special category data or sensitive data in context.

The ICO found that Mermaids' general data protection policies were also inadequate. The staff lacked adequate training and insufficient safeguards were put in place to protect young vulnerable data subjects.

Since the discovery of the leak, the ICO found that Mermaids has taken proactive steps to remedy the infringement and mitigate the adverse consequences. For example, it immediately adjusted its groups.io privacy settings. It informed individual affected and hired a data protection consultant for additional support to address its failings and look into the organisation's data protection policies.

With these considerations in mind, the ICO imposed a fine of approximately €29,250 on Mermaids for its violation of Article 5(1)(f), Article 32(1) and Article 32(2) of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"

The company was not considered an ""authorised person"" who can legally make such calls.

The contravention was held to be ""serious"" due to the significant intrusion into the privacy of the recipients of these calls. It was also ""deliberate"" in light of the lack of due diligence carried out by the company with regards to the data it used.

"Royal Mail is the British postal service and is the data controller. On 29 April 2021, Royal Mail submitted a written breach report to the UK DPA (ICO) that due to a technical error, its marketing actions might have sent emails to “215,202 parties who had expressed a desire to no longer receive marketing from [Royal Mail]”.

Royal Mail explained that it had a list of 245,850 potential recipients, out of which “30,648 had provided valid and existing consent to receive the direct marketing messages, with 215,202 being deemed to have opted out.” On 20 April 2021, at the time of transmission of the marketing email, Royal Mail had sent the email to 30,648 persons while putting 215,202 in a holding step of the campaign.  However, on 27 April 2021, “due to an internal routing error, the 215,202 individuals who had been moved to the “holding step” were accidentally sent a “reminder email” which had been intended only for the 30,648 individuals who had been sent, but had not opened or engaged with, the initial email on 20 April 2021.”

The ICO opened an investigation and sought details about the volume of messages and an explanation of the routing error. Before the ICO, Royal Mail submitted the following:

It uses an automated system called Eloqua to send marketing emails. Royal Mail maintains a single master database of all individuals, i.e. those who have provided their consent to receive marketing emails and also those who have not consented to receive marketing emails. The single database is maintained to keep it updated as per the latest status of consent.

In a campaign, marketing emails are sent by Eloqua to those who have provided their consent. Individuals who have not given their consent are put at the end of the campaign, and the stage of sending them emails is bypassed. A reminder email is sent to persons who have given their consent but have not interacted with the original email.

In the present instance, 215,202 customers who were sent the reminder marketing email fell into two groups, “One group was made up of 91,736 customers who were registered with Royal Mail. This group had previously been presented with Royal Mail’s Fair Processing Notice at the point of registering, and subsequently opted out of marketing emails. The second group comprising the remaining 123,466 individuals were customers who had not registered for a Royal Mail account and had, at the time of using a Royal Mail service, checked out as a ‘guest’. These individuals were not asked about their marketing preferences and had not provided consent to receive future direct marketing.”

At the stage of sending reminder emails, details of persons who had not given their consent were fed to Eloqua due to a human error. Accordingly, persons who had not given their consent received the reminder email, even as they were not sent the original email. However, of “the 215,202 messages sent, the number delivered was “no more than 213,191”.”

Since the incident, Royal Mail has introduced several checks to minimize the risk of potential recurrence.

Royal Mail received six responses/complaints from subscribers who had received the unsolicited marketing email, in reply to which it apologized.","The ICO determined as follows:

Royal Mail contravened Regulation 22 PECR as 213,191 unsolicited marketing emails were received by subscribers.

Royal Mail accepted that it did not have the consent for sending the unsolicited marketing emails as it did not have the consent of those persons, or those persons had used services of Royal Mail as a guest, and were never given an opportunity to provide their consent.

For 123,466 persons who had used Royal Mail’s services as a guest, Royal Mail cannot rely on “the soft opt-in as it cannot be said that individuals were given “a simple means of refusing […] the use of [their] contact details for the purposes of such direct marketing, at the time that the details were initially collected”.”

The contravention was considered to be serious as the emails “contained direct marketing material for which subscribers had not provided valid consent”.

Royal Mail did not deliberately contravene PECR. However, its actions were considered to be negligent as “storing all consented and non-consented email addresses on the same system from which direct marketing emails were sent, and given the risk of human error which could (and indeed did) occur, it is reasonable to think that Royal Mail ought to have been aware of the risk that direct marketing emails could be sent to customers who had opted out of marketing communications.”

Since the incident, Royal Mail took steps to remove the risk of human error. However, Royal Mail ought to have taken have these steps before in order to prevent the incident. Accordingly, “Royal Mail failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contraventions.”

The ICO considered the following aggravating factors:

Six responses/complaints from persons who had received unsolicited marketing emails demonstrate a level of annoyance.

The ICO in 2018 had taken action against Royal Mail for contravening Regulation 22 PECR, and Royal Mail had got clear advice for compliance with PECR.

The ICO considered the following mitigating factors:

Royal Mail undertook to conduct a full internal Data Protection audit of its direct marketing practices.

This was an isolated accident resulting due to human error.

Royal Mail itself reported the incident, despite there being no legal requirement for the same.

The ICO said, “The sending of unsolicited direct marketing messages is a matter of significant public concern. A monetary penalty in this case should act as a general encouragement towards compliance with the law, or at least as a deterrent against non-compliance, on the part of all persons running businesses currently engaging in these practices. The issuing of a monetary penalty will reinforce the need for businesses to ensure that they are only messaging those who specifically consent to receive direct marketing.” Thus, the ICO issued a €23,850 (GBP 20,000) fine against Royal Mail for sending unsolicited direct marketing emails in violation of provision 22 of the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4

Between 2 January 2020 and 2 October 2020, Solarwave Limited made 73,217 unsolicited direct marketing calls, and 30 complaints were submitted in relation to those calls. The calls were made to subscribers who had registered with the TPS and who had not given their prior consent to receive calls.","ICO confirmed that Solarwave Limited contravened regulation 21 of PECR, by making unsolicited direct marketing calls to subscribers who had registered with the TPS at least 28 days prior to receiving the calls, and who had not given their prior consent to Solarwave to receive calls.

ICO also found that the conditions under section 55A DPA for the imposition of a monetary penalty were met.

First, if found that the contravention was serious due to (among other) a substantial number (73,217) of unsolicited calls over a nine-month period, for which Solarwave Limited could not demonstrate that it held valid consent. Valid consent was defined by reference to the concept of consent in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Second, ICO found that Solarwave Limited acted negligently. It stated that companies have at their disposal detailed guidelines on carrying out marketing and on consent under the GDPR, which is why Solarwave Limited knew or ought reasonably to have known that there was a risk that this contravention would occur. Also, in line with standard practice of the TPS to notify the company of complaints, Solarwave Limited must have been aware of the contraventions. In addition, ICO found that Solarwave Limited failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention. Relying on the assurance of third-party providers that the data had been screened prior to purchasing, without undertaking proper due diligence, was not considered as acceptable.

Finally, ICO took account some aggravating features of the case, such as the fact that Solarwave Limited was seen to be rude and persistent when making calls and that it continued to make unsolicited calls pending the outcome of ICO’s investigation.

Before the ICO, Tempcover submitted the following:

1. It sent direct marketing text messages and subscribers could see that they were sent by Tempcover.

2. A total of 1905,776 direct marketing text messages were sent between 26 May 2019 and 26 May 2020. However, it had the data only from 26 November 2019 to 26 May 2020 as per its data retention policy.

3. It had obtained the data of subscribers directly from them when they had sought to obtain a quotation from Tempcover’s website. It claimed that the subscribers got a clear link to its privacy policy and terms and conditions which state: “By submitting your information to the Tempcover Site (“Our Site”) you are consenting to the processing of your information by us and our agents in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By obtaining a quote from us, you consent to Tempcover contacting you, by email and/or SMS, with details of our new products, services and promotions. You can opt out from this at any time by contacting us on contactus@tempcover.com or following the ‘unsubscribe/opt-out’ link in your email or SMS.”

4. Before the data provided by subscribers could get captured, they had to click on “'AGREE AND CONTINUE” to show their acceptance to privacy policy and terms and conditions.

5. It operates an internal suspension list, which is updated in real-time.

6. It provides Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (PECR) training to its staff. Before starting with the SMS campaign, it had conducted a Legitimate Interest Assessment, which had been reviewed by its Data Protection Officer (DPO) and the Marketing Department.

7. Between 26 May 2019 and 26 May 2020, it also sent “29,156,023 emails, and that, of those, 28,822,172 were successfully delivered to a recipient.”

Upon further enquiry, Tempcover submitted that subsequently it had undertaken a host of measures, “amongst which would be a separate button allowing individuals to select their marketing preferences at the point of consent being obtained.”","The ICO concluded as following:

1. Between 26 May 2019 and 26 May 2020, taking into account both text messages and emails, subscribers received 29,970,419 unsolicited direct marketing messages that were sent by Tempcover. These messages were in violation of Regulation 22 PECR.

2. In order to be compliant with PECR, Tempcover should have either held valid consent, or had a soft opt-in mechanism on its website. By failing to provide an opportunity of opting out from direct marketing and making the ‘agreement to marketing a condition of service’, it cannot be said that the consent obtained by Tempcover from the subscribers was “freely given”.

3. The subscribers were automatically enlisted for both email and SMS marketing, without being given an option to specify the medium of their choice. Accordingly, the consent that Tempcover sought to rely upon could was not sufficient and not be considered to be “specific”.

4. As Tempcover did not provide an option to subscribers to refuse to marketing, Tempcover was within the ambit of Regulation 22(3)(c) PECR.

5. ""Legitimate Interest"" is not a lawful basis under PECR, and there must be a valid consent, or a soft opt-in mechanism.

The above contravention was considered to be serious because of the high number of messages. However, the ICO concluded that Tempcover did not deliberately set out to contravene the PECR. Nevertheless, Tempcover was considered to be negligent as “Tempcover knew or ought reasonably to have known that there were risks inherent in its direct marketing activities given that during the investigation the Commissioner was provided with copies of Tempcover’s own training materials which made specific reference to PECR, and the need for compliance with the legislation.” In addition, the ICO concluded that Tempcover “failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contraventions.”

The ICO considered the aggravating factor of Tempcover having financial benefit from the messages, and also the mitigating factor of incorporating new mechanisms which allow subscribers to opt out of unsolicited direct marketing at the point which consent is obtained.

Thus, the ICO issued a monetary penalty of £85,000 (eighty-five thousand pounds) against Tempcover.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4
"The controller is the UK Ministry of Justice ('MoJ'), and processes personal data in the course of carrying out its functions.

In December 2017, the MoJ had already been issued with an Enforcement Notice following a finding by the ICO that it had failed to comply with a large number of subject access requests without undue delay. Then, in January 2019 the ICO ""was made aware by the controller that a backlog of subject access requests had again accrued."" The DPA therefore launched a new investigation into the matter.

After a series of exchanges with the MoJ, the ICO uncovered that there were 7,753 overdue access requests.","As such, the ICO held that the controller contravened Article 15 GDPR by failing to inform the relevant data subjects, without undue delay, whether their personal data was being processed and, where that was the case, failed to provide access, in an intelligible form, to such personal data, and to the information as set out at Article 15(1) GDPR.

As a result, it served the MoJ an Enforcement Notice to bring its processing into compliance by responding to data subjects' pending access requests. It also advised the MoJ to ""develop a recovery plan, containing details of how it intends to remedy the issue of the out-of-time subject access requests.""",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 15
"The Money Hive Limited (TMHL) is a company that calls itself ""a short term loan lender and broker for other lenders and financial service providers"". Mobile UK is an entity representing the interests of mobile subscribers in the UK. Mobile UK has a Spam Reporting Service, and subscribers can report a spam message by forwarding the spam message to Mobile UK.

In September 2020, numerous unsolicited text messages by Money Hive were reported. The Investigating Officer ascertained nine separate message scripts promoting high-interest payday loans. The messages contained links to websites operated by TMHL and were sent to people who had “previously applied online for a loan with a TMHL-operated website” but had left the process midway to due to any reason.

In response to the ICO’s letter seeking information and documentation about consent provided by the subscribers, TMHL stated the following:

•	It had used the services of two platform providers to send the messages.

•	Between 1 January 2020 to 8 September 2020, a total of 752,425 text messages were received by subscribers.

•	TMHL divided consent into two categories: “a) Individuals consent to being notified of their loan application results via SMS; and b) individuals consent to future marketing from it and ""select 3rd parties"" via separate tick boxes.” It added that ""a very small number of customers might not realise that the messages are direct responses to their loan application and consider them to be marketing texts"".

The ICO considered the 'customer journey' documents provided by TMHL and noticed two opt-in statements. Opt-in 1 was accessible after a customer had clicked 'apply now' on the respective website and had entered their contact details. It had the following text, followed by three separate optional tick boxes for email/SMS/phone:

""LoanPig and our 3rd party partners would like to stay in touch with you via email and sms to send you reminders and occasional relevant offers, please tick below if you wish to receive this[. .. ]""

Opt-in 2 had three checkboxes in which the first two checkboxes relating to subscribers being “contacted by SMS, email or telephone by Loanpig (TMHL) and its ""third party partners""” and their agreement to Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy were mandatory.

TMHL’s Privacy Policy stated that if a customer’s application “""does not meet [TMHL's] underwriting criteria, we may pass your details to a broker who may be able to offer you a loan or financial service from their panel of lenders and financial service providers""”. It also provided a list of brokers and further stated, “""[a]s part of the application process some lenders and financial service partners may take up to 24 hrs to respond by sms, email, or phone, so you may receive product offers from them within that period [... ]. To provide the best service possible during your application, we may send you, by sms or email, relevant alternative or complimentary products within the 24h application period"".”

The ICO noticed that many of the brokers listed in TMHL’s Privacy Policy were in the business of lead generation services/affiliate network services.

Before the ICO, TMHL gave evidence of subscribers having opted out of its messaging texts. It also explained the working of its messaging system and the number of messages being sent. On the aspect of messages containing links to third parties, TMHL stated that “they use alternative brokers to obtain a loan for their customers stating: ""[t]his isn't promoting 3rd party websites and we are only paid a commission when the customer gets a loan, not for each lead sent for example so we consider this the same as sending a customer to an alternative lender's website where they may obtain a loan. To confirm, we do not receive any commission if the consumer does not apply online or find a product, so this is not marketing"".” In addition, TMHL submitted to the ICO a “'Legitimate Interest Assessment' document in relation to these messages, which explained that their purpose was to provide an alternative short-term loan [through an alternative broker] when the individual's application to TMHL directly was unsuccessful.”

TMHL informed the ICO that they had started sending these messages from 12 March 2020. TMHL stated that it conducted regular due diligence, but it was on a face to face basis and there was no documentary record of the same.","The ICO concluded as following:

1.	TMHL contravened Regulation 22 PECR by sending 752,425 unsolicited direct marketing text messages that were received by subscribers.

2.	TMHL’s marketing was not solicited as “in order to proceed with the online application, individuals had no choice but to agree to receive an undefined number of contacts via text, email and telephone from TMHL and its third-party partners.” The same is also evident from the high number of complaints received regarding TMHL’s messages.

3.	Messages sent by TMHL were direct messages and not service messages as the messages “advertised the availability of loan products from both TMHL and third-party providers [and] can be appropriately defined as falling within the definition of direct marketing as prescribed by Section 122(5) DPA18.”

4.	A valid consent needs to be “freely given” and the organisation will have to demonstrate how “the consent can be said to have been given freely.” This was not the case with TMHL as it “did provide a separate set of optional opt-in boxes for individuals who might wish to agree to marketing in the future.”

5.	No specific consent was present in this case as individuals “were not able to select the method by which they may wish to receive direct marketing, with agreement to being potentially contacted by text message, email and/or telephone, being a requirement.”

6.	“Consent will not be ""informed"" if individuals do not understand what they are consenting to.” Consent will not be valid if “if individuals are asked to agree to receive marketing from ""similar organisations"", ""partners"", ""selected third parties"" or other similar generic description.” Moreover, “subscribers were denied the chance to select which, if any, of the potential third-parties it might wish to receive marketing messages about.”

7.	TMHL could not rely on soft opt-in exemption under the PECR as “individuals were unable to opt out of receiving these particular direct marketing messages at the point at which their details were taken, since agreement to receipt of these messages was a condition of service.”

The contravention by TMHL was considered to be serious due to the high number of messages resulting in a total of 1,360 complaints. However, the contravention was not considered to be deliberate. Nevertheless, the ICO found TMHL to be negligent as it did not take “thorough steps to understand and implement marketing procedures that are compliant with the legislation.”

Thus, the ICO fined TMHL €60,000 (£50,000) for making unsolicited direct marketing text messages in violation of Regulation 22 PECR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 4
"Tuckers Solicitors (Tuckers) is a limited liability partnership of solicitors and is the data controller. On 24 August 2020, Tuckers became aware that its systems were hit by a ransomware attack. On 25 August 2020, Tuckers determined that the hit had resulted in a personal data breach. It notified the same to the UK DPA (ICO) on the same day and stated, “attack had resulted in the encryption of civil and criminal legal case bundles stored on an archive server. Backups were also encrypted by the attacker”. In total, “972,191 individual files were encrypted. Of these, 24,711 related to court bundles. Of the 24,711 court bundles, 60 were exfiltrated by the attacker” and published on the dark web. As per Tuckers, “the bundles included a comprehensive set of personal data, including medical files, witness statements, name and addresses of witnesses and victims, and the alleged crimes of the individuals.”

Tuckers notified 53 parties (out of the 60) whose bundles were released, as per Article 34 GDPR.

On 27 August 2020, Tuckers appointed a third-party investigator to provide a 'Cyber Security Incident Response Report'. The investigators could not find the source of the attack but found “evidence of a known system vulnerability” that could have been used to access Tucker’s networks and exploit them. Subsequently, the investigators released a patch, which Tucker incorporated in its systems in June 2020.

In September 2020, Tuckers informed the ICO that it had “moved its servers to a new environment and the business was now back to running as normal, albeit without the restoration of the data that had been compromised by the attacker.”","The ICO held that “primary culpability for this incident rests with the attacker”. However, Tuckers violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR as its “technical and organisational measures areas were, over the relevant period, inadequate”. The same was based on the reading of Article 32 GDPR which mandates “a controller when implementing appropriate security measures to consider ""the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons"". The failure to comply with the same was evident from the following:

Although Tucker’s GDPR and Data Protection Policy required two-factor authentication where available, it was not using the same for remote access. The ICO held that multi-factor authentication was a low-cost measure that “could have substantially supported Tuckers in preventing access to its network”. Accordingly, Tuckers failed to meet the requirements of Article 32(1)(b) GDPR.

Tuckers installed the patch after months of its release, during which the attacker could have exploited the vulnerability.

Considering the “highly sensitive nature of the personal data”, Tuckers “should not have been processing personal data on an infrastructure containing known critical vulnerabilities without appropriately addressing the risk”.

Tuckers did not encrypt the personal data, and accordingly “did not ensure appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised and unlawful processing of its personal data, as required by Article 5(1)(f) GDPR”. Although the encryption would not have prevented the ransomware attack, it could have mitigated the damage.

For determining the penalty amount, the ICO took note of the fact that “personal data included within the bundles included special category data, and related to individuals that were particularly vulnerable,   including children and individuals involved in significant crimes”. As per the ICO, “this type of personal data required particularly high levels of security to be applied to it”; and its breach made the infringement more severe. It also determined that Tuckers’ security practices were negligent. The fact that Tuckers informed the data subjects as per Article 34 GDPR and commissioned a third-party investigator was also considered by the ICO.

Tuckers' failure to follow the mandated security standards was considered to be an aggravating factor. Its subsequent actions of taking remedial steps including changes in the way it handles personal data were considered as mitigating factors.

The ICO used the Five-Step Process mandated in the Regulatory Action Policy (RAP) and fined Tuckers a total of €116,784.27 (GBP 98,000).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"An ICO investigation found the airline was processing a significant amount of personal data without adequate security measures in place. This failure broke data protection law and, subsequently, British Airways (BA) was the subject of a cyber-attack during 2018, which it did not detect for more than two months.

ICO investigators found BA ought to have identified weaknesses in its security and resolved them with security measures that were available at the time. The attacker is believed to have potentially accessed the personal data of approximately 429,612 customers and staff. This included names, addresses, payment card numbers and CVV numbers of 244,000 BA customers. Other details thought to have been accessed include the combined card and CVV numbers of 77,000 customers and card numbers only for 108,000 customers.","The ICO held that BA was indeed liable. Because the BA breach happened in June 2018, before the UK left the EU, the ICO investigated on behalf of all EU authorities as lead supervisory authority under the GDPR. There were numerous measures BA could have used to mitigate or prevent the risk of an attacker being able to access the BA network. None of these measures would have entailed excessive cost or technical barriers, with some available through the Microsoft Operating System used by BA. Therefore, considering this, the ICO found that BA had failed to comply with Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5
"The ICO autonomously started an investigation into the three major Credit Reference Agencies ('CRAs') in 2018 under the Data Protection Act 1998. The investigation was paused and then resumed after the new GDPR entered into force in order to ensure the violations were addressed under the modern data protection regime, rather than a historical legal position, given the importance and relevance of such processing activities.

The processing in question is on a very large scale (roughly 50 million people resident in the UK, with more than 500 attributes for each person).

Experian acquired this information from a variety of sources and it also include credit reference data, which could lead to unexpected and 'invisible' processing activities. Experian uses them to propose a variety of marketing-led products (eg. Mosaic and Channelview), which are sold to third parties to enable them more targeted and effective direct marketing to data subjects.

Having found several violations of the new Regulation, the Commissioner issued a Preliminary Enforcement notice on 17 April 2019 to Experian. Afterwards, Experian collaborated with the Authority and provided further details and documents in order to make the improvements requested. On 20 April 2020, a revised Enforcement Notice was proposed.","The ICO found three main categories of failures on Experian's approach to data protection compliance:

1. Transparency and fairness

The privacy notice and the Consumer information portal ('CIP') drafted by Experian were insufficiently clear in explaining how data is collected, processed and sold, in particular in relation to the credit data used in connection with the direct marketing purposes.

Also, the CIP did not specify all the rights available to the data subjects (in particular rectification and restriction under art.16 of the GDPR) and did not set up a proper retention period for the data used.

The Commissioner acknowledged the CIP still fails to set out clearly in one place and at the forefront:

- the attributes that may be processed about an individual;
- the 'invisible' tracing activity undertook for marketing;
- the explanation of the drawbacks or outcomes that individuals may find undesirable.

With reference to the credit reference data, The Authority highlighted that was not appropriate to use them for direct marketing purposes without the active engagement of the individuals concerned. Such consent needs to be either obtained by Experian directly from the individual, or by the lender on the Experian’s behalf, clearly and separately from the collection of data to be shared for credit referring purposes.

2. Art. 14 of GDPR

The ICO found that, where Experian acquires the personal data of a data subject from a third party, Experian does not provide Art. 14 privacy information to the data subject directly, relying on the privacy policy of the third parties, which in many cases provides links to the policies of Experian.

Experian suggested that any direct notification exercise will be extremely costly and disproportionate.  However, the Commissioner’s views are that the question for the proportionality must be considered in the light of the extensive processing carried out by Experian. Moreover, the ICO pointed out that the processing activities are a matter of choice of Experian, and it follows from Experian's business model. The fact that there are large numbers of data subjects cannot in itself be a determinative factor against the proportionality of the notification.

The cost could be seen as high because it is the cost of an accumulation of many years during which there has been a failure to give notifications.

3. Lawful processing

The Commissioner considered that it is unlikely that Experian would be able to apply its legitimate interests for intrusive profiling for direct marketing purposes. The Legitimate Interest Assessment put in place could not be considered to be properly balanced.

Also, the Commissioner was not satisfied that the privacy information and data capture mechanism of Experian’s suppliers with regards to the transparency and lawful obligations of the GDPR. It seemed that an individual could be confused about which marketing activities they had, or had not, consented to, and how much control they had over the onwards processing of their data.

Therefore, the Commissioner is requiring Experian to take specified steps to comply with the GDPR. In particular, within 3 months:

- revise the CIP to set out a clear summary of the direct marketing activities that Experian undertakes; place information that is likely to surprise the individuals, in a clearer and more concise language; - cease using credit reference data for any direct marketing activities other than those requested by the individuals. - delete any data supplied by third parties on the basis of the consent which is now being processed on the basis of the Experian's legitimate interests.

Also, within 9 months, Experian must:

- directly provide all data subjects with an 'Art. 14 privacy notice', potentially sent by mail or other similar means; - review the compliance with the GDPR of the privacy notice of its suppliers to provide the same standard of transparency as the CIP; and their data capture mechanisms in order to have a valid 'consent' to the disclosure and further processing of the data carried out by Experian.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 14"
"Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc’s (“Starwood”) IT system were first compromised by unknown attackers in 2014. Marriot subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but did not detect this attack at any time between that moment and September 2018. Therefore, between 2014 and 2018, the attackers  had access to Starwood’s systems through use of Remote Access Trojan malware, and kept extracting Starwood databases. Marriott became aware of potential attacks following an alert from a system applied to one of its most confidential databases on September 2018. After that Marriot found malware installed and proof that databases had been extracted over the years, so they promptly notified both the ICO and relevant data subjects of the breach. The ICO found that the attackers had obtained unencrypted personal data of the likes of: passport numbers, identifying information of the costumers such as name, date of birth and gender, plus credit card details in encrypted form.","Although the ICO and the relevant victims were notified promptly of the breach, the ICO found that  there were many failures in placing the technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data in Marriott’s system as required under Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 GDPR. Marriott’s shortcomings, as outlined by the ICO, were the following: insufficient monitoring of privileged accounts and their user activity, insufficient monitoring of databases, poor control of critical systems and systems that have access to large amounts of personal data, and the fact that only certain type of sensitive data was encrypted (e.g. credit card numbers) but not all (e.g. many passport numbers). The ICO fined Marriott in line of Article 83 GDPR but also took into account mitigating factors such as the efforts that Marriott made to inform and help the victims of the breach, the $19 million investment it made on security the following year and the financial impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, lowering the final amount of the fine from £24 million to £18.4 million.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"

"The Swedish DPA Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten (IMY) was informed, through information in the media, that Stockholm Public Transport (SL) was planning on giving their employees body cameras in order to prevent threatening situations, to better document incidents, and to ensure that they issue fines to the correct offender when someone travels without a valid ticket. This information led to the DPA to start an investigation of SL.

The purpose of the investigation was to find out if SL had lawful grounds for processing in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR and if SL provided information about the processing in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR. IMY also investigated if SL followed the principles of lawfulness and transparency in accordance with Article 5(1) GDPR.

SL found that the employee body cameras automatically record everything in one minute intervals and then automatically delete the recording afterwards, unless the employee presses the ""record"" button on the camera. The employees are instructed to keep the camera active during all working hours.

SL provides information about the fact that their employees have body cameras to the public but they do not inform travelers about the fact that, apart from video, the cameras also record sound.","The Swedish DPA (IMY) accepted the stated purpose of the body cameras, but opined that the duration of the automatic recording needs to be minimised to a maximum of 15 seconds.

It also found that the undisclosed recording of sound by the body cameras to be a serious violation because travelers cannot be expected to assume and accept continual eaves-dropping when they travel by public transport. This violation was considered severe because hundreds of thousands of people use the Stockholm public transport system every day.

Ultimately, the DPA (IMY) held that SL violated Article 5(1)(a) and 6(1) of the GDPR because they did not have lawful grounds for processing the personal data of public transport travelers, which they obtained through the use of body cameras, and that SL did not provide enough information about the processing according to Article 13 GDPR.

"Klarna Bank AB is a company which provides both credit and non-credit payment solutions to approximately 90 million consumers and more than 200,000 merchants in 17 countries through a variety of financial services, such as direct payment, various forms of ""try first and pay later"" services and payment through installments, as well as account information services. In order to provide these services, Klarna needs to process large amounts of personal data. The Swedish DPA (IMY) initially examined Klarna's privacy policy, and noted that there was a lack of clarity regarding many aspects, and therefore decided to launch an ex officio investigation to determine Klarna's compliance with the provisions on clear information and communication to data subjects. During the investigation, Klarna continuously changed the information provided on how the company handled personal data. IMY's decision concerns the information  as it stood from 17 March to 26 June 2020.","After conducting their investigation, the IMY held that Klarna had violated various GDPR provisions related to information on the purpose and legal basis for the processing of personal data, the recipients of various categories of personal data, international data transfers, retention periods, data subject rights and automated decision-making, including profiling. As a common thread, the IMY held that each one of these breaches also entailed a violation of Articles 12(1) GDPR, 5(1)(a) GDPR and 5(2) GDPR.

Regarding the information provided by Klarna on the purpose and legal basis for the processing of personal data related to the ""My Finance"" and ""My Economy"" services, the IMY held that this information was not concise, clear and easily accessible, and did not meet the requirements of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR.

With regards to the recipients, the IMY held that Klarna provided incomplete and misleading information on who were the recipients of different categories of personal data when such data were shared with Swedish and foreign credit reference agencies, in violation of Article 13(1)(e) GDPR.

Specifically on the topic of international data transfers, the IMY noted that a mere statement that personal data will be transferred to third countries, without naming these countries, was not adequate information for data subjects in this sense. Moreover, the IMY held that Klarna not only failed to provide information about the countries outside the EU/EEA to which personal data was transferred, but also as to where and how data subjects could access documents regarding the safeguards applicable to the data transfers where no adequacy decision exists between the EU and these countries, in breach of Article 13(1)(f) GDPR.

Furthermore, the IMY also held that Klarna provided incomplete information about the periods for which personal data would be retained and the criteria used to determine those periods, in violation of Article 13(2)(a) GDPR.

Regarding data subject rights, the IMY held that Klarna did not provide them with adequate information related to the right to erasure of personal data under Article 17 GDPR, restriction of processing concerning the data subject under Article 18 GDPR,  the right to object under Article 20 GDPR as well as the right to data portability under Article 21 GDPR, in violation of Article 13(2)(b) GDPR.

As to automated decision-making, including profiling under Articles 22(1) and (4) GDPR, the IMY noted that it was not clear whether Klarna used its own internal scoring model based on, among other things, both internal and external financial information, or what types of data are included in the financial information, such as information on liabilities with other creditors. The IMY also observed that no information was provided regarding the logic behind these processes, their significance, the types of personal data that played a decisive role when subject to a negative decision, or the foreseeable consequences for data subjects, in breach of Articles 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(g) GDPR.

In order to determine their administrative fine, the IMY took into account that Klarna is a multinational company that processes many different categories of personal data on a large number of data subjects, including privacy-sensitive data such as financial data and creditworthiness, and that these breaches were ongoing for a long period of time. Based on these considerations, the IMY issued a fine of approximately €730,000 (SEK 7,500,000) against Klarna Bank AB.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14"
"Uppsala regional authorities notified the Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten - IMY) that a personal data breach had occurred in their jurisdiction in 2019. Based on this notification, the Swedish DPA initiated an investigation into the medical data which the Uppsala University Hospital emailed to patients from abroad, as well as to the foreign hospitals which referred those patients.

According to its internal procedures, once the hospital had finalized treatment to a patient from abroad, a medical report was sent to the patient and the referring hospital. Although it can be sent by post, the hospital gave the recipient the option of choosing their preferred channel to receive the report, which in the majority of cases was via email.

These medical reports have been sent by email without encryption since 2014. Although at some point the hospital began using Microsoft Outlook’s Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, if the email software on the recipients’ side did not support TLS, the emails were sent without encryption. Once sent, the emails and medical records themselves remained stored in the hospital’s Outlook account.

In 2019, after conducting an internal risk analysis and a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) the hospital introduced an encryption solution for secure email.","In its decision, the IMY established that its investigation was limited to analysing matters related to the security of the processing, and it had not examined whether this processing complied with other GDPR provisions, such as those related to the transfer of personal data to third countries.

The IMY took into account Recital 75 and 76 GDPR in order to carry out an assessment of the responsibilities of the University Hospital Board (the controller in this case), according to the risks involved in the data it was processing. The IMY highlighted that this case involved large amounts of medical data, which is a special category of data with extra protections under Article 9 GDPR, including children’s data.  The IMY held that in this case, because of the fact that the data sent was only encrypted once Outlook’s TLS was eventually adopted, and also only when the recipients’ software supported this protocol, the hospital had not been able to ensure that the emails it sent were encrypted according to the risk involved in the processing, in breach of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

The IMY also noted that the local government of Uppsala had issued a policy document related to the handling of emails which specifically prohibited sending sensitive personal data by email, and therefore the hospital should have identified the risks posed through processing the data in this manner. Additionally, the IMY stated that the purpose of an email system like Outlook is to disseminate and communicate information, and not an appropriate place for the storage medical data, because of its exposure to unauthorised access on the internet. Therefore, the IMY held that the University Hospital Board had violated Article 32(1) GDPR by failing to incorporate appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing.

In order to determine the fine for these violations, as aggravating factors, the IMY took into consideration the large amount of data and the long period of time over which it was shared, as well as the fact that the hospital had violated specific regional policy guidelines. As a mitigating factor, the IMY recognised that the hospital had eventually introduced an encryption solution for files in 2019. Based on these considerations, the IMY imposed a fine of approximately €150,000 (1,600,000 SEK) on the University Hospital Board for the violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"The controller, an eGovernment portal (eUprava), published multiple public documents on its digital bulletin board.  These documents published more personal data than what is permitted by national law (Article 96 of the General Administrative Procedure Act.

* information on the reasons for public notification, 
* the authority which has issued the document, 
* the number, date and type of the document, 
* the personal name or business name of the addressee, 
* the address for service or other permanent or temporary residence if the addressee does not have an address for service,

Additionally, the controller published the following personal data (not explicitly permitted by the ZUP):

* individuals’ date of birth,
* decisions to suspend the procedure for granting international protection, in full.","Slovenian DPA held, that the controller (public sector) violated Articles 24 and 25 of the ZVOP-1 and Article 32 of the GDPR. The controller failed to ensure an adequate level of personal data security in order to prevent illegal publication.

Author's note: in accordance with the practice of the IP, the controller should protect personal data, the publication of which is not explicitly permitted by law, with a password or in any other appropriate manner.

As the controller had already complied with the GDPR during the inspection procedure, the IP stopped further procedure. However, the IP announced that this violation will also be assessed in the context of misdemeanors (seperate procedure).",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"During the inspection procedure, the IP established that the controller was carrying out video surveillance at a bar. An outdoor camera recorded the entrance and the outdoor terrace. The first indoor camera captured the server rooms and the bar counter and the right side of the building. The second indoor camera captured the server rooms and the left side of the facility.","The Slovenian DPA (IP) held that a bar owner does not have a legitimate interest in monitoring the various server rooms and outdoor terrace of the bar with video surveillance, but does have a have a legitimate interest in monitoring the bar counter (where bottles of higher value and the cash register are contained) and the bar entrance. Accordingly, the DPA gave the bar fifteen days to adjust the viewing angles of its surveillance cameras to record only the counter and entrance.

The DPA explained that video surveillance is the processing of personal data (Article 4(2) GDPR) and the operator of video surveillance is responsible for complying with the principles set out in Article 5 GDPR, including data minimization, purpose limitation and storage limitation. In assessing the adequacy of procedures and measures to ensure an adequate level of security of personal data, the bar must also comply with Article 32 GDPR, which provides that controllers and processors shall ensure a level of data security appropriate to risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals by, for example, endeavoring to maintain the confidentiality of data subjects.

According to national law (ZVOP-1), video surveillance of a business premises may be carried out for the safety of people or property, to ensure control of entry into or exit from or from business or business premises, or if, due to the nature of the work, there is a possibility of endangering employees. Thus, the bar has a legitimate interest, as recognized in Article6(1)(f) GDPR, in processing data limited to those purposes. In contrast, there is no provision allowing for the general surveillance of employee workplaces, such as server rooms, if the protection of people in these workplaces can be achieved by milder means. The interest of the bar manager in securing the bar rooms also does not outweigh the interests and freedoms of bar guests. The IP thus concluded that there is no legitimate interest, based in a need for data processing, for video surveillance of spaces where guests are located and where employees work.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6
"The controller is an employer (company) that had dealt with a mass infection of COVID-19 at the company. To prevent this from happening again, the controller collected the full name and medical condition of employees who were positive with COVID (the data subjects). It then sent out an email to all of the other employees who may have been in contact with an infected employee, by informing them of the person who had been tested positive for COVID. Moreover, the controller did not keep a database of all persons infected with COVID and had informed all employees about their rights under Article 13 GDPR.

The DPA started an investigation ex officio into the processing of health data and whether the controller was compliant with the GDPR.","The DPA noted that informing employees who may have been in contact with an employee of the fact that they have been in contact with an infected colleague, was a preventive measure of public health protection. However, it found that the controller could have also informed these employees without disclosing the infected employees' full name. According to the DPA, the objective of preventing a mass-spreading could still have been achieved this way. Consequently, the DPA found that the controller unlawfully processed the infected employee's health data, pursuant to Article 9 GDPR, and violated the principle of data minimisation, Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

The DPA ordered, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d), to bring the controller's processing operations into compliance with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and Article 9 GDPR, and thus to inform employees who had contact with a positive employee, without providing that positive employees' name.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 9, Article 13"

The company claimed that the purpose of the cameras was the prevention and solving of crimes as well as the tracking of goods.

Customers were also concerned by the data processing, since some of the cameras were directed towards the sales areas. In some of these areas, people could typically spend longer periods of time, for example in order to extensively test the equipment on sale, and were still being monitored.","The LfD Niedersachsen reminded notebooksbilliger.de that a company must always first consider milder means than videos surveillance for purposes of crime prevention and solving.

They collected nearly 58,000 supporting signatures.","The DPA fined both controllers approximately €8,000 (HUF 3,000,000) each. Moreover, the DPA ordered the controllers to obtain valid consent from the data subjects and, in case of failure, delete the respective personal data. It also prohibited the controllers for the future from managing the data in the same way. The decision is based on several violations of the GDPR.

First, the controllers processed the personal data without valid consent and therefore without a legal basis. The requirements for consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR were not fulfilled. Also, since personal data revealing one's political opinions constitutes a special category of personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR, explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a) GDPR) would have been necessary for part of the processing operations. In addition, the controllers had not used two-factor authentication and the privacy policy was misleading. The DPA found that the data subject had not been able to express their will, making the consent invalid.

Second, the DPA found a violation of the principle of data minimisation, Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. It found that the controllers had in reality intended to build a sympathy mass data base.

Third, the controllers violated the principles of fairness, lawfulness and transparency pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by misleading the data subjects about the purposes of data processing and the identity of the controller. In addition, Article 13 GDPR was violated because the controllers did not provide the data subjects with all information necessary.

Fourth, the DPA found an infringement of the principle of accountability, Article 5(2) GDPR because the controllers could not provide their compliance with Article 5(1) GDPR. In particular, the controllers did not carry out the data processing in such a way that they could prove at any time their compliance with the GDPR.

Finally, the DPA criticised the general conduct of the controllers in the proceedings. The controllers had not cooperated with the DPA.

"A public interest disclosure was made to the Hungarian DPA (NAIH) detailing a personal data breach. In the given case, the XI. District Office of Budapest Government Office (In Hungarian: ""Budapest Főváros Kormányhivatala XI. kerületi Hivatala""; hereinafter referred to as ""District Office"") transferred by email (in an Excel sheet attached to the email) the data of 1153 patients to general practitioners (physician) in the XI, XII and XXII Districts of Budapest related to the COVID testing of patients. The Excel sheet was not protected by password or by other means. A person (who was not even a general practioner originally addressed by the District Office) forwarded the above referred Excel sheet and the District Office's related email to the NAIH in the form of a public interest disclosure.

The NAIH examined whether the transferring of patient data by the District Office constituted a personal data breach, the related risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, as well as the breach management of the District Office.

It is worth noting that after the receipt of the NAIH's inquiry concerning the personal data breach, the District Office requested the opinion of the data protection officer of the Budapest Government Office. The data protection officer was of the opinion that the above transfer of patient data by email by the District Office constituted a personal data breach, but that the breach did not result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons since it was only received by general practitioners who are subject to professional secrecy.","The NAIH decided that the transfer of patient data by email by the District Office constituted a data breach, since the personal data (involving sensitive data) was forwarded to general practitioners who did not have the right to access such data. This also means that the District Office should have only sent the data of patients to the competent general practitioners in the given district with password protection (by providing the password through a different channel) or should have chosen another way to transfer the data in a safe manner (e.g. through the Hungarian Electronic Health Service Space).

With regard to the personal data breach, the NAIH also highlighted that it resulted in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. A wide scope of sensitive data became accessible to unauthorized third parties, raising the chance of additional unauthorized persons having access to the related data and processing it unlawfully, (e.g. the person making the public interest disclosure to the NAIH or any person possibly sending direct marketing materials related to health services).

NAIH further highlighted that the emergency situation caused by the Covid-19 outbreak did not exempt the District Office from complying with the appropriate data security standards. Bearing in mind that  the District Office performs public tasks, processes health data as its core activity, it should therefore be expected to process the related data carefully and in a way that is appropriate from a data protection point of view and to assess the risks associated with data processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33, Article 34"

Deichmann informed the customer that the recording can only be accessed by the police following an official request. The customer filed a police report, but the camera recording was no longer available by the time of the request.

Following this situation, the NAIH conducted an ex officio investigation into the company and found that Deichmann was operating cameras extensively throughout the country, with cameras in all 129 of its stores.

The DPA found that the controller had breached multiple GDPR provisions in connection to data subject access requests. Amongst these, the company did not keep separate records of the data subject requests that it had been receiving.","The DPA first held that the request to access the camera images does fall within the scope of Article 15(1) GDPR. Furthermore, the NAIH emphasised that the controller's claims were incorrect with regards to the footage only being accessible to the police.

The NAIH also pointed to the importance of Article 12(4) and offering data subjects adequate explanations on the reasons for a controller's refusal to act on a data subject's request.

Regarding the deletion of the recording, the DPA held that Deichmann breached Article 18(1)(c). The controller should have kept the data following the data subject's request, until his legal claim was settled.

The Icelandic DPA launched an investigation regarding the lawfulness of the processing.","The Icelandic DPA first highlighted that the use of the blood samples for scientific research had been planned before the study was finally approved. The data subjects were however not informed of this possible use of the blood samples until after the approval of the study, when they were asked to consent to further processing.

The Icelandic DPA therefore concluded that the processing did not take place in a legitimate, fair and transparent manner in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

"Upon learning that the Chief Epidemiologist had outsourced screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as antibody testing to a hospital and a genetic research company, the Icelandic DPA initiated an investigation into the lawfulness of the processing.","The Icelandic DPA first highlighted that, in connection with the virus screening and antibody testing, the Chief Epidemiologist acted as a controller in accordance with the Icelandic Epidemiology Act. The Icelandic DPA further found that Landspítali (the Hospital) was only processing personal data on behalf of the Chief Epidemiologist, and was thus acting as a processor, while the company Icelandic Genetics (Icelandic Genetics) was acting as a sub-processor of the personal data.

The Icelandic DPA held that the processing of personal data for SARS-CoV-2 screening and testing by the the Chief Epidemiologist and the Hospital was overall compliant with data protection law. However, the Icelandic DPA found that the data processing agreement between the Chief Epidemiologist and the Hospital was incomplete with regards to several requirements set in Article 28(3) GDPR, and notably points b, c, e, f, g and h. For example, the processing agreement did not contain any information on the deletion or return of personal data (Article 28(3)(g) GDPR). In addition, the processing agreement was referencing outdated data protection legislation. The DPA therefore ordered the Chief Epidemiologist to enter into a new data processing agreement with the Hospital which would comply with all the requirements of Article 28(3) GDPR.

Furthermore, the Icelandic DPA held that the data subjects should have received more information on the purpose of the processing by Icelandic Genetics pursuant to Article 14(1) GDPR. In particular, it was unclear whether the screening and testing only served as a measure for disease control or whether it could also be used for scientific research. The Icelandic DPA therefore concluded that Icelandic Genetics should better inform the concerned data subjects about the purposes of the processing.

"In September 2020, the Icelandic DPA initiated an investigation on a digital gift card application provided by the Ministry of Industries and Innovation (the Ministry), and developed by the company YAY ehf (YAY). The aim of the application was to issue a digital gift certificate to all Icelanders over 18 years old in order to stimulate domestic tourism in the summer 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After the app was published on 18 June 2020, the DPA became aware that, in order to be able to use the digital gift card, the users of the application had to submit their personal data, such as, email address, phone number, age and gender. Moreover, the users were also required in some cases to give an access to their phones´ camera, microphone, GPS location, calendar, contact information as well as data on USB storage.

The DPA decided to open an investigation to assess whether the collection of users´ data and the acquisition of access rights to their mobile devices by the digital gift card application were in compliance with the GDPR and the Icelandic Act no. 90/2018 on data protection and the processing of personal data. In the context of this investigation, the Icelandic DPA found that the Ministry was the controller of the personal data and that YAY was a processor of the personal data.","In its decision from 23 November 2021, the Icelandic DPA came to conclusion that the Ministry had breached several principles of the data protection legislation.

"Since 2015, the Icelandic health authorities had appointed Landspítali Hospital (the Hospital) to conduct border and domestic screening to monitor the spread of infectious diseases. It was agreed that the Hospital was allowed to subcontract services in order to carry out this screening. In June 2020, the Hospital sought the services of a company named Icelandic Genealogy (IG) to conduct COVID-19 screening tests. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was carried out by the Icelandic Medical Director of Health (the Director) in consultation with the Icelandic DPA. The DPA observed that there was no indication that this processing would violate the GDPR. As a result, the Hospital outsourced part of the testing and screening activities to IG.

However, in August 2020, the Hospital publicly announced that they would temporarily relocate part of their own staff to IG’s facilities to use some of their equipment and software (Virlab) in order to increase their screening capacity. Following this announcement, the Icelandic DPA asked the Hospital for specific information regarding security measures related to the processing of personal data, and whether a new DPIA had been carried out by the Hospital before relocating part of their staff to IG’s facilities.

The Hospital disregarded this request, and related part of its staff to IG’s facilities, as planned. The DPA reiterated their request in September 2020. The Hospital then responded to the DPA, apologising for the delay, and explaining that they had began using IG’s facilities expeditiously in order to respond to the increased demand in sampling due to the pandemic.

The Hospital also stated that they had not conducted a new DPIA because they considered that the previous DPIA applied to the processing that would now temporarily take place at IG’s facilities. However, prior to the transfer of some staff members to IG’s facilities, IG only had access to sample numbers sent by the Hospital. Once part of the Hospital's staff started working in IG’s facilities and using their equipment, the IG’s Virlab system registered the names of individuals who had tested positive in border screening, as well as identification codes from samples taken at health centres which could be traced back to the individuals concerned. IG’s staff did not have access to this personal data as registered in the Virlab system, except for three employees involved in its design, programming and making necessary updates.

In November 2020, the DPA began an investigation, auditing the Hospital and IG in order to determine whether the new processing operations conducted by the Hospital's staff at IG’s facilities was compliant with the GDPR.","The Icelandic DPA found that the Director and the Hospital failed to comply with Article 35(1) GDPR by not conducting a new DPIA.  The DPA held in particular that a new DPIA should have been carried out due to fact that the Hospital would now be processing personal data using IG’s facilities and Virlab system, which gave some IG employees access to that additional data. It explained that the initial DPIA could not be applied to these new circumstances. Previously, IG’s staff only had access to sample numbers which did not include personal data or data that could be traced back to an individual, so the circumstances were not comparable.

The DPA also held that, despite the absence of a new DPIA, there had been no violation of Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR (responsibility of the controller), Article 25 GDPR (privacy by design and by default) or of Article 32 GDPR (obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing). The DPA found indeed that the processing of the personal data at IG's facilities did not lead to a security breach, taking into account the fact that only 3 IG staff members had access to the personal data stored in Virlab, and that this access was necessary for the programming and maintenance of the software.

However, the DPA did reprimand the Hospital for not complying with answering their questions related to the security of personal data prior to the transfer of their staff to IG’s facilities. The DPA reminded the Hospital that the GDPR must be complied with even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as already stressed by the European Data Protection Board in its “Statement on the processing of personal data in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak” issued on March 19, 2020.

The Icelandic DPA however stated that it was aware of the pressure that the Icelandic health authorities have been under since the outbreak of the pandemic and, in view of these special circumstances, it would not take further action in this case.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 35
"The lawyer of the company acting as data controller, Húsasmiðjan, contacted the Icelandic DPA (Persónuvernd) with regards to the installation of a fingerprint scanner system for the company's employees. The controller announced the DPA that it is using the system, and asked for the DPA's opinion on the legality of the processing operation.

The company had used the fingerprint scanner system for the logging in and out of employees in the company's payroll system. When an employee arrived at work they would have to scan their fingerprint, which created a number sequence with a timestamp that was linked to other information on the employee.

The image of the fingerprint itself was not stored and could not be retrieved from the number sequence stored in the system. In this aspect, the number sequence works similarly to an employee's ID number, and is not personally identifiable except for when the system performs the identity verification. Furthermore, encryption (256bit AES) was also used to make it difficult to reverse the process and identify individuals through the raw fingerprint image.","The Icelandic DPA held that the processing of biometric data by Húsasmiðjan was not lawful. In its reasoning on using consent as a legal basis, the DPA also referred to Recitals 42 and 43 and pointed towards the power imbalance inherent in the nature of most employment relationships. This difference of positions between employer and employee would mean that the consent is not freely given especially considering that in the particular case, the employees were not not informed of any other option for logging in to the workplace that did not involve the use of their biometric information. It was therefore unclear what the consequences would be for an employee if they would refuse to provide their fingerprint data. Since the use of the biometric system was not optional for employees, the DPA held that the data could not be processed based on consent.

The DPA then examined whether the lawfulness of the processing could be based on the necessity for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, namely labour legislation and legislation on social security and social protection. In this context, the DPA held that less intrusive methods could also be used to achieve the same goals without processing sensitive data. Examples of such alternatives can be employee cards, access tags, or access codes. Therefore, the DPA decided that the processing of the fingerprint data was not necessary to achieve the company's goal, as this could have been achieved through less intrusive means which did not involve the systematic processing of biometric data.

As a consequence, the Icelandic DPA used its corrective powers and ordered the data controller to stop using the fingerprint scanning system, as well as delete the biometric information of its employees.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 9, Article 58"
"Persónuvernd received a notification of a personal data breach from Breiðholt Multicultural School. According to the notification, an attachment containing sensitive information about earlier students was mistakenly sent by a teacher to new students. The teacher mistakenly sent an email with an attachment that included information about interviews that had been conducted the previous semester. The document contained special categories of data concerning the former students. The comments included information about the students’ well-being, learning outcomes and social conditions. The information was to a large extent about qualities that the students’ lacked. In one case it related to the fact that the child protection authorities were connected. In another case there was information about mental health, and in another case, physical health.","Persónuvernd highlighted that personal data must be processed in accordance to the principles found in Article 5 GDPR, in this case Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. In addition, Persónuvernd highlighted Article 32 GDPR as operationalising the requirement to implement adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure the secure processing of personal data.

In light of the requirements for controllers to provide adequate security of personal data, Persónuvernd found that the dissemination of special categories of data was not in line with the requirements as found in GDPR.

"The Icelandic DPA was informed that a bank intended to publish photographs from a children's soccer tournament on their Facebook page. They initiated an investigation on the basis of previous advice from the Persónuvernd, which had directed people working with children not to use Facebook for sharing personal information about children.  The bank replied that the parents and guardians of the children had given consent for the sharing of the photographs, and that they had several legitimate interests for using Facebook to share the photos, including taking advantage of a communication medium used by most Icelanders and building a positive image.","The Icelandic DPA decided that consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR could not be used as a lawful basis here, as the parents or guardians of the children had not been given a sufficient degree of information by the bank about the processing prior to it taking place.

It also decided that the bank did not have a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR either. While the DPA accepted that marketing purposes are generally accepted as a legitimate interest for processing, they noted that the Recital 38 GDPR emphasised that the personal data of children should be given special protection, which they interpreted as excluding the use of children's personal data for marketing purposes. In light of this elevated degree of protection for children, the fact that the bank would not have full control over the photographs published on Facebook, was also a factor for the DPA in deciding there was no legitimate interest.

The DPA advised the bank to make the images accessible in an access-controlled manner to the sports clubs involved in the tournament as an alternative to using Facebook.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 58"
"On the occasion of a news report, the office of the chief of police in the capital area requested information and suggestions via the social media Facebook. Following this event, the DPA started an investigation into whether such processing complied with Act no. 75/2019 on the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes. The DPA asked the office questions concerning processing data via Facebook by the police and then considered received answers.","The DPA held that all processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes must comply with the principles set out in Article 4. Act no. 75/2019. It states that in the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes, care shall be taken to ensure that it is processed in a lawful and fair manner, that the processing is necessary for the competent authority for law enforcement purposes, that information is obtained for clearly stated, lawful and objective purposes and not further processed. In addition, the processing of sensitive personal data must comply with one of the additional conditions of the first paragraph, following Article 6 Act no. 75/2019.

As such, personal information was processed in accordance with the role of the police according to the second paragraph of Article 1 Police Act no. 90/1996.  The police keeps a register of complaints they receive about crimes with all the necessary information concerning cases, a diary with information about complaints and their resolution, a list of arrested persons and other files necessary for law enforcement interests to avert imminent danger or deterrence. we commit crimes. In view of the above, the DPA considered that the processing of personal information for the purpose in question is generally permitted, provided that it is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the previously cited law.

At the same time, however, the DPA considered Article 14 of Act no. 75/2019, which states that the storage of personal information should be in accordance with Act no. 90/2018 on personal data protection and the processing of personal data and the Act on Public Archives. According to Act no. 90/2018, Coll. Article 44 of the General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679, it is not permitted to process personal data in such a way that copies of communications are kept outside the European Economic Area, provided that such processing is not based on the sources of Chapter V of the Regulation.

In this context, the Data Protection Authority pointed out that communications through Facebook are stored there without the possibility for users, at least without special agreements with Facebook, to adequately delete the information contained therein. Therefore, communication via Facebook cannot be compared to communication via traditional telecommunication devices, your own portal, small programs or e-mail.  According to the DPA, when personal information is shared with the police via Facebook, it is shared with Facebook at the same time. It is also clear that Facebook shares personal information with companies related to Facebook, as well as other parties (ie third parties), in further specified circumstances.

The DPA concluded  that the processing that took place went against the stated procedures of the office of the Chief of Police in the capital area and without an assessment of the impact on personal protection due to the processing. The chief of police in the capital area's processing of personal information, requesting information and suggestions from the public, via private messages on Facebook, due to incidents that may be related to law and/or concerning certain individuals, has not complied with Act no. 75/2019, on the processing of personal information for law enforcement purposes.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 44
"The psychotherapy firm 'Vastaamo Oy's' (hereafter, the Firm) experienced two data breaches in November 2018 and March 2019, where its patient records were hacked by a third party (the attacker). During an investigation conducted by the Finnish DPA, it was found that the Firm had become aware of (at least) the latter data breach at the time it happened.

The breaches were not reported to the Finnish DPA until late September 2020, shortly after the Firm had been subject to blackmail by the attacker. The following months, at least 15,000 patients were also blackmailed. In particular, the attacker tried to obtain monetary advantages from them by threatening to publish their personal patients records, and around 300 records were actually leaked online on the Tor network.

Following this affair, the Firm suffered financially and was ultimately declared bankrupt by the District Court of Helsinki in February 2021.","The Finnish DPA found that the firm had violated Articles 33(1) GDPR (notification of data breaches to the DPA) and Article 34(1) GDPR (communication of data breaches to data subjects) for having failed to report in due time the data breaches to the Finnish DPA and to the data subjects, respectively.

Furthermore, the Finnish DPA found that Article 5(1)(f) GDPR had been violated because the Firm had failed to implement appropriate security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the personal data. The Finnish DPA also considered that the Firm had violated its security obligations under Articles 24(1), 25(1), 32(1) and 32(2) GDPR. Finally, the Finnish DPA considered that the firm had failed to respect the principle of accountability enshrined in Article 5(2) GDPR, as it could not demonstrate compliance with the core principles of the GDPR.

The Sanctions Board of the Finnish DPA decided to impose a fine of €145,600 for infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR, a fine of €145,600 for infringement of Article 34(1) GDPR, and a fine of €316,800 for infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

"During the autumn and winter of 2021–2022, the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the controller) noticed and investigated a data breach in respect of personal data of seconded Finnish staff working abroad. On 24 January 2022, the controller notified the Finnish DPA of the data breach. The controller also notified the affected data subjects.

On 9 March 2022, the Finnish DPA asked the controller for further clarification on the timing of the notifications under Article 33 GDPR and Article 34 GDPR. The controller claimed that the main reasons for the late notifications were the investigation of the data breach and related national security considerations, alongside the division of responsibilities between authorities.","The Finnish DPA held that the controller had failed to comply with Article 33 GDPR and Article 34 GDPR. Consequently, it issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.

First, the DPA held that the controller did not comply with the 72-hour time limit to notify a supervisory authority set out in Article 33(1) GDPR. The DPA held that the 72-hour time limit only starts running after a controller finishes its investigation of the potential data breach and obtains reasonable assurances that the data breach truly occurred. It is only then that the controller must notify the DPA of the breach within 72 hours. However, the DPA held that the controller took longer than 72 hours after its investigation was finished to notify the DPA. Hence, the controller violated Article 33(1) GDPR.

Second, the DPA held that the controller did not provide reasons for the delay within the meaning of Article 33(1) GDPR. The explanations given did not demonstrate that the controller could not comply with the 72-hour time limit for submitting the notification to the supervisory authority in accordance with the GDPR.

Third, the DPA held that the controller did not comply with Article 34(1) GDPR, which requires that the controller notifies the data subject of the data breach without undue delay. The controller should therefore have reported the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay which it failed to do.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 58"
"The DPA carried out an investigation into the controller’s processing on its own behalf, after receiving information from the police. The controller is the Kymenlaakso Joint Municipal Authority for Health and Social Services Kymsote. It assesses families that plan to be foster parents for their eligibility. During this procedure, the controller requires parents to file an access request to the police pursuant to Section 23 of the (Finnish) Criminal Data Protection Act, to see if there is a criminal record or status report on (one of) the parents. Such a report would contain valuable information for the controller’s assessment, for example whether someone has been arrested for drunk driving. Then, in the presence of the parents, the controller’s coaches would check the reports for any absolute obstacles to becoming a foster parent. The controller claimed that this information is absolutely necessary for the assessment.

The DPA assessed whether the controller’s processing was in accordance with the GDPR.","First, the DPA considered that the reports contain personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, and therefore Article 10 GDPR applies. Moreover, it noted that the controller carries out a task in the public interest, and the controller can, in principle, rely on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. However, the DPA also considered that pursuant to Article 6(2) GDPR, Finnish legislation contains a more detailed provision that regulates the processing of personal data pursuant to Article 10 GDPR, in Section 2(1)(3) of the Act (504/2002) on Criminal Background Check of Persons Working with Children. Moreover, it found that this legislation creates a proportionate and appropriate procedure for checking the criminal background of persons working with children. Second, the DPA considered that the purpose of a data subject's access request is not to provide a public authority with information that the data subject obtained from it. As stated, there was a proportionate and appropriate procedure in place to obtain this information.

Hence, it found that the controller’s procedure violates Article 6(1) and Article 10 GDPR, since there is no lawful basis for the processing of the personal data in question, and the controller should just follow the procedure listed in the Act 504/2002. Consequently, the DPA issued a warning to the controller pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR and ordered the controller to bring its processing operations in compliance with the GDPR, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 10"
Finnish DPA received multiple complaints regarding Posti’s (the national postal company) change-of-address notifications data processing activities.

As per subsection 1 (d), the data subject must be informed of all recipients that may receive the data and consequently, the data subject must also be informed of their right to object for this type of processing.

The Finnish DPA held that the controller had not been transparent in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR, and that the information regarding the data recipients and the data subjects’ right to object was not provided to all data subjects in a timely manner at the point of data collection.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13"

A DPIA should be mandatory if the data processing is likely to be a high risk to the individuals’ rights.

"Following the investigations carried out in November 2019 on Taksi Helsinki’s processing, the Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto found several serious GDPR violations regarding the processing of customers’ audio and video personal data.","First, the Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto decided that the controller was not able to demonstrate that the processing of video and audio data for security purposes complies with Article 5 (1) (a) and Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Thus, the controller failed to comply with the accountability principle under Article 5 (2) GDPR. Second, the data protection authority pointed out that the recording of images and sound in all of the company’s cars did not comply with the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. The recording of the image would have fit the purposes of safety and the investigation of criminal offences and damages which might have occurred, as claimed by the controller.  Regarding the information to be provided to the data subjects, the data protection authority ruled that several pieces of information were missing, such as the right to lodge a complaint and whether the provision of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, (Article 13 (2) and (e) GDPR). The authority also stated that there was no link between the controller’s privacy policy and the information about the loyalty program website targeting the consumer. This prevents the data subject from exercising their GDPR rights during the processing, and results in an incomprehensible overview of the processing of personal data by the controller in the context of the automated decision making for the loyalty program. Thus, the authority held that the controller did not comply with Article 12 GDPR.  In identifying the controller or processor, in particular the role of the taxi drivers in the processing at stake, the authority held that Taksi Helsinki did not defined what personal data it processes as a controller. Thus, the authority decided that Taksi Helsinki failed to demonstrate its compliance with Article 26 GDPR.  Furthermore, Article 30 GDPR does not require that a report of the processing activities has to be drawn in a specific form other than in writing. However, a report has to be drawn in a document and cannot only subsist in the privacy statements that the data controller provided. Thus, Taksi Helsinki violated Article 30 GDPR.  Lastly, the authority decided that the controller did not carried out any impact assessment.

The data controller has further communicated the personal data breach to data subjects pursuant to Article 34 GDPR, also by giving public notice. According to the information provided by the data controller, 9,000 to 10,000 data subjects have thus been directly contacted by letter.

However, about 7,000 data subjects could not be reached due to a lack of contact data. As communication to the aforementioned data subjects would involve disproportionate effort under Article 34(3)(c) GDPR, the data controller gave public notice on its website informing its customers of the data breach. In addition, a bulletin has been published on the controller's Facebook Fanpage.","As the data controller could not communicate a personal data breach to all affected data subjects due to a lack of contact data, it should not have (publicly) claimed that additional breach information was sent to all of them, creating the impression that data subjects not contacted were not affected.

"The Polish DPA (The Office for Personal Data Protection) received a complaint from an individual about irregularities in the processing of his personal data by a Bank, consisting in the transfer of the Complainant's personal data - without his consent - to a brokerage house. In order to determine the facts of the case initiated by the complaint, the Office for the Personal Data Protection, on three occasions, summoned the brokerage house to respond to the complaint and to provide explanations. Specifically, it asked the brokerage house about whether it processed the Complainant's data, on what legal basis, and for what purpose. It also asked how the brokerage house sourced the Complainant's data, whether the Complainant objected to processing, and if so, how the brokerage house responded.

The brokerage house claims that it did not receive a summons containing the questions. However, a copy of the summons was twice sent and served to the brokerage house at the address disclosed in the official register. Therefore, the summons sent to the brokerage house were deemed delivered. As a consequence of the failure of the brokerage house to respond to the correspondence addressed to it, the DPA was not able to obtain the information necessary to examine the case. The initiation of proceedings to impose an administrative fine on the brokerage house did not change the situation either, because the brokerage house claims that it did not receive the letter initiating such proceedings either.

"The controller, Fortum Marketing and Sales Polska S.A. (""Fortum""), trades in electricity and gas fuel, including the sale of electricity and gas to end customers, both in the business sector and to households. Within the scope of its business activity, Fortum cooperates with the processor PIKA Spółka z o.o. (""PIKA""). PIKA provides Fortum with archive services, including digital archives. The parties are bound by a Data Processing Entrustment Agreement from 2018 and a Storage (Document Archive) Agreement with associated services from 2016.

Fortum notified the Polish DPA of a personal data protection breach. According to them, the data of 137,314 customers had been copied. The breach of confidentiality concerned a newly created database containing information on Fortum's customers as follows: name and surname, residential or residence address, PESEL number, type, series and number of an identity document, e-mail address, telephone number, number and address of access point and contract data (e.g. date and number of contract, type of fuel, meter number).

Fortum did not notify the data subjects of a data breach because, in its assessment, there was no high risk of a breach of the rights or freedoms of natural persons. Fortum presented the analysis results that finally established the number of persons to be notified of a personal data breach due to a high risk of infringement of rights or freedoms of natural persons. The explanations indicated that the data of 120,428 persons had been exposed, of which 95,711 persons should have been notified of the breach. The remaining numbers were business customers and deceased persons.

Findings made in the course of the proceedings indicated that PIKA, as a processor to which Fortum had entrusted the processing of personal data of the persons affected by the breach, was also involved in the data breach. PIKA explained that, in case of changes to the systems, the individual departments of its IT division are required to record any changes made to the systems in their internal project management support and control systems. However, when making changes to the system, actual personal data of the Controller's customers were used. The effectiveness of the security features applied was not verified before the changes to the system were submitted to Fortum to resolve the performance issue. The security functions were not tested during the works carried out. In 2020, the Polish DPA notified PIKA of its recognition as a party to the proceedings.","The DPA imposed administratives fine of PLN 4,911,732 (roughly €1,000,000) on Fortum and of PLN 250,135 (roughly €53,000) on PIKA.

The DPA noted that under EN ISO/IEC 27002:2017-06, it is recommended to avoid using personal or other sensitive data as test data. If personal data are used during testing, it is recommended to protect all sensitive details and context by deleting or modifying them. The standard mentioned above accepts that actual data may be used for testing purposes, but such data should be subject to special protection. First of all, when real data is used for testing purposes, the same access control procedures should be applied in the tested applications as those used in production systems.

The DPA held that PIKA had acted contrary to the agreement on entrusting personal data processing, which required, among other things, to implement data pseudonymisation. In defining the security measures that it would apply to protect personal data, PIKA omitted, in particular, the obligation arising from the GDPR to take into account the state of technical knowledge when defining them. The DPA cited the legal doctrine indicating that the need to consider the state of the art may be understood as the need to apply measures that reflect current security standards. This requirement may be read as the need to apply solutions currently considered adequate while not applying outdated solutions commonly assessed as not ensuring security.

The DPA emphasised that using a processor did not exempt Fortum from these obligations. As a controller, the obligations in this regard remained primarily with Fortum itself. When analysing the actions, or rather the lack of actions by Fortum in this respect, the DPA concluded that it was more important for the controller to increase the capacity of the system as soon as possible than to ensure an adequate level of security of personal data processed using this system. It should be emphasised that Fortum indicated in the course of the proceedings that in the past practice of the Processor introducing changes to Fortum's systems, such changes were introduced according to a pre-agreed work plan, tested by Fortum on a test environment and only then implemented in production. Consequently, in the opinion of the DPA, both Fortum and PIKA failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing of personal data located in the IT system subject to modification, which constitutes a breach of Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR.

Both Fortum and PIKA failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing of personal data, which led to Fortum breaching their confidentiality in connection with the occurrence of a personal data breach, i.e. a breach of the principles of confidentiality and integrity referred to in Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

According to Article 28(1) GDPR, where the processing is to be carried out on behalf of the controller, the controller shall only use the services of such processors that provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures so that the processing meets the requirements of the GDPR and protects the rights of the data subjects. In the case in question, Fortum indicated that it had not verified PIKA prior to entering the data processing outsourcing agreement. Fortum has been cooperating with PIKA for many years, and no security incidents have occurred so far. Additionally, as Fortum pointed out, PIKA is a market leader in terms of the services provided and represents a high standard of archiving and digitalisation. Given the above, Fortum considered it sufficient to sign an agreement on entrustment of personal data processing together with arrangements indicated in the appendix to the agreement.

Before initiating the administrative proceedings in question, Fortum also did not exercise the right of control referred to in Article 28(3)(h) GDPR concerning PIKA's provision of the measures required under Article 32 GDPR. Only after a personal data security breach had been identified and the administrative proceedings in question had been initiated, Fortum send a Processor Questionnaire to PIKA as the first element of the processor verification process.

The DPA pointed out that, since the processing was to be carried out on behalf of the controller, following the wording of Article 28(1) GDPR, the controller could only use the services of such processors that provide sufficient guarantees regarding the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures. Long-term cooperation of the parties, not supported by periodic, systematic audits or inspections, does not guarantee that the processor will adequately perform the tasks required by law and arising from the concluded entrustment agreement. A positively assessed cooperation in the past may only be a starting point when verifying whether the processor provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures so that the processing fulfils the requirements of GDPR and protects the rights of the data subjects. Indeed, the requirement set out in Article 28(1) GDPR applies to any data controller that, in the course of its business, uses the resources or services of a processor when processing personal data. The mere signing of a personal data processing outsourcing agreement without an appropriate assessment of the processor cannot be considered the fulfilment of the obligation to carry out a verification procedure of the processor concerning its compliance with the requirements of GDPR. Long-term cooperation and use of the services of a given processor before 25 May 2018, i.e. before the application of GDPR, also does not exempt from the obligation to carry out such an assessment.

According to the DPA, Fortum did not carry out such verification in the case at hand. It only contented itself with a positive assessment of the processor as a result of previous cooperation, during which, as it explained, there were no security incidents. However, the consequence of failing to carry out this assessment is that Fortum has breached the requirement set out in Article 28(1) GDPR. Given the above findings, the DPA concluded that in the case at hand, the conditions justified the imposition of administrative pecuniary penalties on both the controller and the processor.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32"
"In May 2020 Warsaw University of Technology (the controller) notified the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection of a data breach. The breach notification indicated that an unknown and unauthorised person downloaded from the University's IT network resources a database containing personal data of students and lecturers of studies from 2008 to 2020, as well as 169 candidates for studies for the academic year 2019/2020 (a total of 5013 persons).

The categories of data affected by the breach include: first and last name, parents' first names, date of birth, home or residence address, PESEL number, email address, username and/or password, mother's family name, ID card series and number, and telephone number.

The President of the Office for Personal Data Protection has notified the controller of the initiation of administrative proceedings concerning the possibility that the University, as a data controller, has breached its obligations under the GDPR.

In the course of the proceedings, the organisational unit of the University, in order to fulfil its tasks, uses an IT system, within which there is an application (for approximately 10 years) used by students to register for courses and to obtain access to their study history and fee settlements, as well as to prepare certificates, statistics and other documents required by the University. Within this system, lecturers were able to upload files related to the subject they were teaching.

The application was created from scratch by the University's employees, as none of the solutions offered on the market was able to meet the required needs.

There was a second application running in parallel, and both of them used access to the database that contained the personal data subject to the breach.

In January 2020, according to the file's metadata marking, an unauthorised third party with credentials took advantage of the application's file upload functionality by a person with lecturer privileges and uploaded a backdoor file to the application's directory, intended for lecturers to store files. The unauthorized person obtained the application login credentials through a third-party system (the user likely used the same login credentials on different systems).

In April 2020, according to the file metadata marking, a second backdoor file was placed in the application directory. In May 2020, according to the server log marking, an unauthorised download of personal data was made using the file placed in April 2020. According to the author of the initial post-hack analysis report, this file was likely uploaded using the functionality provided by the file posted on the server in January 2020.","The President of the Office for Personal Data Protection found that Warsaw University of Technology, with its registered office in Warsaw, violated the provisions of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 24(1) GDPR, Article 25(1) GDPR, Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR by:

(a) failing to apply appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the confidentiality of the processing services at all times, failing to regularly test, measure and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of personal data processed in the IT system, and thus failing to properly consider the risks involved in the processing of personal data in the aforementioned system.

(b) failing to take into account the risk related to the processing of users' passwords in the application in the form of a hash function, which does not provide a sufficient guarantee of security, which in the absence of other technical and organisational measures to ensure secure processing in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR, constitutes an exposure of data subjects to an increased risk of violation of the rights or freedoms of natural persons in the event of a breach of the confidentiality of the processed data.

(c) failing to analyse the legitimacy of the 4-week storage of logs (event logs) of the virtual machine on which the system was located, and failure to analyse the legitimacy of the lack of a detailed event log in the application, which determines the failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures ensuring the maintenance of the ability to quickly and effectively identify the occurrence of any breaches in order to ensure the possibility to take appropriate action.

"The penalised company regularly notified the DPA of violations of the protection of personal data of the Company's customers, which consisted, inter alia, in couriers losing documents containing personal data of the customers or giving documents containing personal data such as: name and surname, address of residence or stay, PESEL (national identification) number, e-mail address, series and number of identity card or other identity document, telephone number and data concerning contracts between the parties.

When analysing the notifications of breaches, the DPA pointed to a significant lapse of time from the date of occurrence of an event causing a personal data protection breach to the date of its discovery by the Company and, consequently, notification of the breach to data subjects and the President of the DPA. The notifications made by the Company in the analysed period of June 2020 included events causing personal data protection breaches from February and January 2020, and even events from 2019.

The Company indicated that it clarifies the cases of violations with the carrier on an ongoing basis in order to eliminate the problem of delays in providing information on data loss. The Company additionally explained that the period of the ongoing pandemic had a significant impact on the timeliness of notifications of personal data protection violations concerning the proceedings in question in terms of verification of the correctness of handling the return document process. According to the explanations of the Company, due to the limitations of courier companies related to the period of the pandemic, the process of verification and handling of return documents was prolonged, hence the information about the events was reported by the carrier with a delay. The Company emphasized that, in its opinion, the actions it undertakes bring effects in the long run, because the percentage of personal data protection violations in relation to the volume of all deliveries is small and it presented calculations for the month of June in that respect.

The supervisory authority found that the Company had not provided sufficient evidence of the measures it was taking to minimise the risk of the infringement recurring.","The DPA fined a satellite platform operator €250,000 for failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures when cooperating with a courier company. The controller reported breaches (consisting of a parcel being lost by the courier company or delivered to the wrong person) to the DPA, as well as notifying the affected persons of the incidents two or even three months after they occurred. In the opinion of the DPA, it is the controller who should take effective measures that will firstly minimise the scale of the breach and secondly enable faster identification of such incidents and thus notification of the affected persons and the supervisory authority. The lack of adequate organisational and technical measures in place to quickly identify breaches results in data subjects being unaware for a long time of the risk of their data being used by unauthorised persons, e.g. for so-called identity theft.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 31, Article 32, Article 34, Article 83"
"The penalized entity is a foundation ('the Foundation') whose statutory objectives include, among others: providing legal assistance, legal and psychological counselling, assistance to persons wronged by crime and their families, activities to protect the rights of persons wronged by public institutions, the public health care system or entities operating in the insurance sector.

The supervisory authority received notice of a suspected breach of data protection compliance by the Foundation as part of an criminal investigation conducted by the Ministry of Justice on the theft of the folders. The DPA asked the Foundation to clarify whether the breach had to be reported to the DPA, demanding an analysis of the breach, information on the foundation's data protection officer as well as evidence over discussing the possibility of consultancy from the DPA.

The Foundation stated that it did not report the breach to the supervisory authority, that it did not designate a data protection officer and the analysis of the breach gave a low assessment of gravity. On this basis, the Foundation decided that there was no infringement that requires notification to the DPA.

The Foundation stated that the personal data breach concerned 96 persons in total. The information lost contained their first name, surname, correspondence address and telephone number. For 3-4 of these persons with a polish citizenship, the information lost also contained the social security number.

In view of the failure to report the breach to the DPA and to communicate it to the persons concerned, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings against the Foundation.","The DPA held that the Foundation violated Article 33(1), Article 34(1) GDPR by failing to notify the DPA of a personal data protection breach without undue delay, no later than within 72 hours after the breach was identified, and by failing to notify the data subjects of a personal data protection breach without undue delay. The supervisory authority imposed on the Foundation an administrative fine of  €3,000 (PLN 13,644).

The DPA stressed that Foundation has in practice deprived the data subjects of the possibility to counteract potential damage. Only by informing the data subject without undue delay, the Controller allows the person concerned to take the necessary preventive measures to protect their rights and freedoms against the negative consequences of the personal data breach.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 57, Article 58, Article 83"
"The data subjects are customers at Bank Millennium S.A. (hereafter: controller). They provided the controller with their personal data in March 2019 to have a bank account set up. In May 2019, the controller notified them of the loss of their personal data. However, since the data subjects did not obtain additional information on the breach, in June 2019 they filed a complaint with the UODO (Polish DPA). During the DPA’s investigation, it turned out that, in April 2019, the controller sent a parcel to its Head Office, with several documents. These documents contained, in particular, the following data: name, surname, PESEL, registered address, bank account numbers, CIF number (identification number assigned to the controller's clients) of the Applicant and the Applicant's name, surname and PESEL.

The controller considered the circumstances of the breach, i.e., what personal data had been lost, and assessed this breach in accordance with a methodology based on the European ENISA methodology (a risk management assessment tool by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity). Based on this assessment, the controller considered that the breach is likely to (only) cause a medium risk of violation of the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Hence, it did not notify the data subjects in accordance with Article 34(1) GDPR, only supplying very general information on the nature of the breach, and that the data subjects could use the controller’s free Alert service to minimise the negative effects. Moreover, the controller also did not notify the DPA in accordance with Article 33(1) GDPR.

During the DPA’s investigation, the controller brought forward a number of arguments why it had not notified the data subjects and the DPA, i.e., that parcels are also categorized as ‘lost’ without leaving the supplier’s infrastructure, that the loss of PESEL numbers does not cause a high risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and that the data subject’s personal data was not actually used in an unauthorised manner. Also, regarding the assessment, the controller stated that it considered elements such as (1) the context of data processing (what type of data has been disclosed), (2) ease of identification (how easily are data subjects identified through this personal data), and (3) the circumstances of the breach (what was the security and confidentiality of the data).","First, the DPA held that the notification of data breaches to the DPA is especially important because it allows the DPA to verify the controller’s assessment whether or not the breach leads to a high risk of the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Moreover, regarding the obligation to notify data subjects in case of a high risk, the DPA emphasised that this obligation does not depend on the materialisation of the negative consequences, but on the possibility of such a risk occurring. Hence, it is irrelevant whether or not the unauthorised recipient of the personal data actually came into possession and familiarised himself with the personal data, for the risk of the occurrence to be considered high.

Second, the DPA held that the risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects through the loss of the personal data in this case, must be qualified as ‘high’, and not as ‘medium’, since the loss of this data could have lead to identity theft or falsification, or financial loss. In this regard, the DPA emphasised that the PESEL number is a national identification number, and therefore requires exceptional protection pursuant to Article 87 GDPR. Moreover, it stated that there were no factors reducing the level of probability of negative effects, such as limited possibility of identification, finding that personal data are publicly available, or considering the wrong recipient as a ""trusted"" person.

Hence, since the controller did not notify the DPA, it violated Article 33(1) GDPR. Moreover, it violated Article 34(1) GDPR since it did not provide the data subjects with the information listed in Article 33(3)(b), Article 33(3)(c), and Article 33(3)(d), as Article 34(2) GDPR prescribes. Therefore, the DPA decided to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR. It considered the elements listed in Article 83(2).

The DPA held that the nature of the infringement was severe and intentional (since the controller decided not to inform the DPA). Moreover, the duration (two years since the infringement) was long, cooperation with the DPA was unsatisfactory, the personal data contained a unique identifier (PESEL number). However, it also considered that only two data subjects were affected and that the controller provided these data subjects with some information on the actual breach. The DPA, therefore, decided that an administrative fine of PLN 363,832 (approx. €80,000) was effective and proportionate.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 83"
"The President of the District Court (the controller) reported the loss of an unencrypted USB-Stick by a probation officer. This USB-Stick contained the personal data of 400 persons, subject to probation supervision. Besides names, dates of birth, addresses, data on convictions etc., the stick also contained sensitive data (health data).

The controller stated that he had implemented a system of rules to secure the protection of personal data (the Security Policy), updated the documentation constantly. To ensure the effectiveness of these measures, the controller provided stationary and e-learning trainings to all of the District Court's employees.

One of the rules forbade the use of private ""information carriers"" for processing business data. However, although users of USB-Sticks (like the probation officer) had the obligation to store the stick in a lockable work bag, measures like encryption and password protection of media, were not obligated. The user was, ultimately, responsible to implement appropriate safeguards for the storage on the USB-Stick. Lastly, although the controller claimed that the DPO conducted ad hoc checks, with additional system security evaluation by the IT department, he did not provide any evidence to the DPA that confirmed that such tests actually occurred.","The DPA found that the controller breached Article 5(1)(f), Article 24(1), Article 25(1), Article 32(1)(b) and (d), and Article 32(2) GDPR due to a lack of a reliably conducted risk analysis, combined with the lack of regular testing, measuring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of processing.

First, regarding the risk analysis, the DPA stated that, for the risk analysis, the controller should take into account the characteristics of the processes involved, assets, vulnerabilities, threats and existing safeguards as part of the processing of personal data taking place. The data controller determined that the loss of a USB-Stick was a ""medium risk"", which meant that ""training for personnel on potential threats"" was deemed a sufficient measure to reduce the risk to a ""low level"" risk. The DPA stated that such measures can not be regarded as sufficient. Nor do they suffice the requirement to put in place appropriate technical measures, since the controller obliged the users, like the probation officer that lost the USB-Stick, to implement technical safeguards on their own. Now, the user might not have enough technical knowledge to know how to implement such safeguards. Hence, ultimately, the lack of guidance resulted in the possibility for unauthorised persons to access the personal data processed on that medium.

Second, the DPA considered that the implementation ad hoc tests by the DPO, do not suffice the requirement of regular testing, since they are not ""aimed at verifying the effectiveness of the implemented security measures. New risks may arise during the the implementation of individual processing activities. Hence, it is of utmost importance that such testing is carried out regularly, so that the results of these tests can be evaluated carefully.

It follows from the Polish DPA decision that by losing the memory stick, the President of the District Court committed a breach of, inter alia, the principle of confidentiality and integrity, as laid down in Article 5. Hence, the Polish DPA set an administrative fine of PLN 10,000, considering as a mitigating circumstance the good cooperation of the President of the District Court with the supervisory authority, undertaken and conducted in order to remove the violation and mitigate its possible negative effects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32"
"The DPA was notified of a data breach situation by an insurance brokerage company. The company played two roles in data processing. On the one hand, it was a data controller, and on the other hand, a processor acting for insurance companies.

The data breach involved emails containing identifying data being sent to the wrong recipients. The emails contained analyses of insurance needs and an insurance offer referencing name, surname, PESEL number, town, postal code and other information about the subject of insurance.

The insurance brokerage company, as the controller of the name and surname data, decided to report the breach of personal data protection to the Polish DPA. The company considered that the combination of this data, in conjunction with the data contained in the attached documents, could result in a breach resulting in a risk of infringement of an individual's rights or freedoms. The erroneously sent correspondence contained personal data contained in quotes and calculations from several insurance companies.

Investigation carried out by the Polish DPA revealed that in connection with the incident, several insurance companies, including data controllers, had notified them of the data breach. However, no such notification was received from Sopockie Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń ERGO Hestia S.A (“Company”).

The Company had conducted an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals resulting from the breach, based on which it concluded that it was not obliged to report the data breach to the DPA or to inform data subjects of the data breach.","The Polish DPA imposed an administrative fine of approximately € 35,387 EUR (PLN 160,000) on the insurer, Sopockie Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń ERGO Hestia S.A,  for failure to report the breach of personal data protection. In addition, the insurer was fined for not notifying data subjects about the breach, which was also required by the supervisory authority.

The DPA explained that a breach of data confidentiality in connection with a breach of personal data protection - through the sharing of documents with unauthorized recipient which contained: the calculation of an insurance premium, PESEL number, information about the proposed period of insurance, the subject of insurance (house), the sum insured, as well as the name, town and postal code of the data subject - amounts to a high risk of infringement of the rights or freedoms of natural persons.

High risk of harm to the rights or freedoms of natural persons exists where the breach is likely to lead to physical harm or damage to the property or non-property of the individuals whose data has been breached. Examples of such damage includes discrimination, identity theft or falsification, financial loss and damage to reputation.

"The Polish DPA received a notification of a data breach involving the personal data of 10,500 persons. The controller was Santander Bank Polska S.A. The cause of the breach was the misconduct of a former employee who had not been not deprived of their access to the Electronic Platform of Services of the Social Insurance Institution once their employment contract had been terminated.

This gave the former employee unauthorised access to personal data belonging to the employees contained in the bank's payment profile,  including their first and last names, address, national identification number, and information related to sick leaves. The bank, however, did not notify the data subjects that this breach had occurred, which prompted the DPA to initiate administrative proceedings against the bank.","In the course of the proceedings, the Polish DPA established that the former bank employee logged into the platform five times, thus gaining unauthorised access to the personal data of the bank's employees.

The DPA held that the confidentiality of the processing was compromised and, given the nature of the data, this involved a high risk for the data subjects' rights and freedoms. Therefore, the DPA stated that the bank should have notified the data subjects of the breach, pursuant to the obligation expressed in Article 34 GDPR, in conjunction with Article 12 GDPR.

Based on this assessment, the DPA issued an administrative fine of approximately €120,000 (PLN 545,748) on the bank for a violation of Article 34(1) GDPR.

Consequently, the persons affected by the breach knew nothing about it.

Proper compliance with the obligation imposed by the DPA would allow data subjects to understand what the personal data breach consisted of, the possible consequences of such an event, and what steps they can take to minimize its possible negative effects.

In the course of the proceedings, Polish DPA established that unauthorized disclosure of data took place in a waste management company.

An employee of the company, responsible for supervising the printed list of addresses of people in quarantine, left it for a short time without proper supervision. At that time, there was also another employee of the company in the room - a driver, who, taking advantage of the fact that the person responsible for supervising the printed list was directed back to him, copied (recorded as a photo) the list. The driver was to be informed by the person supervising the printed list whether, as part of his or her work, waste is to be collected from the places on the above mentioned list.

In the submitted explanations, the company stated, that it carried out the analysis taking into account the circumstances related to the processors' failure to comply with the procedures in force in the company and the circumstances related to the stealing or removal of data.

In the proceeding, the DPA established that the breach took place after one of the servers operated by the controller's processor (hosting company) was restarted and the appropriate security configuration was not restored.

The controller was notified about this by one of the cybersecurity specialists, who detected the vulnerability and indicated sample, publicly available information. The controller, instead of diligently checking his reports and monitoring the processor whether it duly dealt with the case in terms of checking the security, had doubts as to whether this was an attempt to extort other data, which they indicated in their correspondence to the processor.

As a result, they did not immediately check the identified vulnerabilities in the system and a few days later the data was stolen from this server. The stolen data concerned 140,699 clients of the company. These data included: name and surname, level of education, e-mail address, employment data, e-mail address of the person to whom the client wants to recommend the loan, earnings data, marital status data, telephone number (landline, mobile, previously used telephone number), PESEL number, nationality, NIP number, password, place of birth, correspondence address, registered address, telephone number to the place of work and bank account number.","According to the DPA, when assessing the first signal of irregularities, the controller did not take into account the risk related to the processing of personal data resulting from the accidental disclosure of personal data, which constitutes a violation of Article 32(2) GDPR.

"In May 2020, the authority was notified of a personal data breach. It consisted in sending by e-mail, by an insurance agent, who is an entity processing for an insurance company, an insurance policy containing personal data to an unauthorised addressee. In this way, the confidentiality of data of two persons was violated in the scope of names, surnames, residential or correspondence addresses, PESEL (national identification numbers), telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and information concerning the subject of insurance (passenger car), the scope of insurance, payments, assignments, as well as additional provisions resulting from the agreement. The supervisory authority has been informed about a personal data protection breach by an unauthorised addressee who has come into possession of documents not intended for him/her containing the aforementioned personal data.

PUODO conducted an investigation and received information from the insurer that a personal data protection breach consisting in providing personal data to an unauthorised recipient actually took place. The company indicated that an assessment was made with regard to the risk of violation of rights and freedoms of natural persons. On the basis of the assessment, the Company concluded that there was no breach resulting in the need to notify the President of UODO, because:

1. the customer provided an incorrect e-mail address to which the insurance policy document was sent, 2. the unauthorised recipient has informed the Company, so it can be concluded that he was aware of the regulations and importance of the information he received.

The Company accepted that there is no high probability of negative consequences for the data subjects through unauthorised use of their data and indicated the applied corrective measure in the form of a request to the unauthorised recipient to permanently delete the message together with a request for feedback confirming its deletion.

The authority has indicated to the Company that the fact that the infringement occurred as a result of an error of the customer who provided the agent with an incorrect e-mail address cannot affect the assessment of the event and its classification as a personal data protection violation. It results in making personal data available to an unauthorised person, which means that data confidentiality has been breached. What is more, due to the fact that the indicated data confidentiality violation concerns PESEL numbers together with names and surnames, residential addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, it should be considered that it may involve a high risk of violation of rights or freedoms of natural persons. At the same time, the President of UODO has again called upon the Company to carry out an analysis of the risk of infringement of rights and freedoms of natural persons necessary to assess whether there has been a breach of data protection resulting in the necessity to notify the President of the UODO and the persons affected by the breach.

However, the Company has upheld its argumentation and previous risk assessment. In the absence of notification of a personal data breach to the PUODO and the lack of notification of a personal data breach to the persons affected by the breach, the authority initiated administrative proceedings.","The PUODO held that the insurance company infringed the GDPR provisions, failing to notify a personal data breach to the DPA without undue delay and for failing to notify a personal data breach without undue delay to data subjects.

The Polish DPA asked the company to explain the circumstances of the incident, to present an analysis of the incident and to assess whether, in connection with the situation, there was a need to notify the supervisory authority of the breach and the persons affected by it. The penalized entity indicated that an assessment was made in terms of the risk of infringement of rights and freedoms of natural persons, on the basis of which the company concluded that there was no infringement resulting in the need to notify the DPA. Moreover, the company considered that due to the prompt actions taken, such as the declaration of an unauthorized addressee that he/she had permanently destroyed an attachment he/she was not authorized to receive, the possibility of the occurrence of negative consequences of this event for data subjects in the future was eliminated. Due to the failure to report the data protection breach, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings against the company, which in the course of the proceedings maintained its previous positions presented in correspondence with the DPA and still failed to report the breach to the supervisory authority.","According to the DPA, a declaration by an identifiable person to permanently destroy an attachment with personal data does not eliminate the risk of a data breach at all. The DPA found that the company had a duty to report the data breach and had failed to do so within the timeframe set out in Article 33(1) of the GDPR, meaning that the company had breached this provision.

The supervisory authority found it necessary to conduct inspection activities at the entity which actually operated the telephone calls and processed the data.

When arrived at the company's registered address, the UODO’s inspectors did not find any representatives of the Vis Consulting Sp. z o.o. After the back-and-forth communication between the UODO representatives and the company's proxy, the latter informed the UODO on the phone that the inspection cannot take place.","The President of the UODO decided that Vis Consulting Sp. z o.o. in no way wished to cooperate with the supervisory authority.

The UODO concluded that the company deliberately thwarted the inspection and thus prevented the President of the UODO from performing statutory tasks under Article 58(1)(e) and (f) GDPR. The situation gives rise to the suspicion that the Company's thwarting of the inspection was aimed at preventing the UODO from collecting evidence of unlawful processing of personal data by the company.

Thus the company infringed the provisions of the GDPR referring to cooperation with the supervisory authority and enabling it access to all personal data and any information.

Hence, the President of the UODO concluded that the conditions for imposing a fine on the company were satisfied.

In December 2018 the Company reported another infringement consisting in gaining unauthorised access to the Company's employee account. The employees of UODO conducted an inspection in the Company.

The DPA found that the Company violated the principle of confidentiality as a result of two attempts to gain access to the Company's employee panel and access to the database of all the Company's clients by unauthorised persons. The access to the Company's employee panel and to the data of all the Company's clients from the Company's database system resulted in the materialisation of the risk of infringement of rights and the freedom of natural persons whose data are processed by the Company in the form of the application of the method called phishing, which is aimed at extracting data, e.g. credentials to a bank account by impersonating the Company in SMS messages and using the fact of making an order by the customer.","The DPA found that the company violated the rules of personal data processing and imposed a fine of PLN 2,830,410 on it.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83"
"The decision of the UODO’s President concerned the proceedings related to the activity of a company which processed the data subjects’ data obtained from publicly available sources, inter alia from the Central Electronic Register and Information on Economic Activity, and processed the data for commercial purposes. The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. In total, the company has 7'594'636 records of data concerning natural persons, and the company fulfilled the information obligation in relation to only 682'439 persons in relation to whom it has email addresses within the database record. The company raised the ground that the communication by registered letter would cost its turnover for the year 2018, which would constitute a ""disproportionate effort"" and would critically disturb the functioning of the company.","The President of UODO found that:

1) The applicable provision is the Art. 14 GDPR since the data controller collects the personal data from public sources.

2) No, the company completed its obligation only in relation to 682'439 natural persons conducting business activity, whose personal data has been processed by the company's IT ""N system"", in relation to which the company had an electronic address.

3) No, the mere placement of the information on the company's website cannot be considered as sufficiently fulfilling the obligation mentioned in the Art. 14 GDPR.

4) No, in the assessment of the President of UODO, sending out information related to Art. 14 GDPR by regular mail to the address of a natural person conducting business activity or transmitting it via telephone contact, is not an “impossible” activity, and it doesn’t involve “a disproportionate effort” in the situation when the company is being in possession of address data of natural persons conducting one-man business activity (currently or in the past) and also, in addition to that, the telephone numbers in reference to a fraction of these persons, in its IT system. However, it is necessary at this point to mention that as opposed to the above mentioned natural persons, the situation of shareholders or members of companies’ bodies and other legal persons, whose data are being processed by the Company, is different. In public registers (in particular in the National Court Register) the telephone/address data are not included, and in this regard the Company would have to search for this data in other sources, which could mean “a disproportionate effort” for the Company.

Finally, the fact that the company justified the non-fulfillment of the obligation resulting from Art. 14 GDPR with possible high costs, and even tried to shift the responsibility – in case of the fulfillment of this obligation - for possible decrease of its competitiveness on the market, the loss of financial liquidity and even the need to terminate its business activity, has to be recognized as an aggravating factor. It should be emphasized that although the company obtains personal data from public sources and such data are the subject of its long-term commercial activity, the data subjects lack the information regarding the processing of their personal data by the company. In the assessment of the President of UODO, the liability towards these data subjects lies with the company, in particular with regard to the fulfillment of the obligation referred to Art. 14 (1) to (3) of the GDPR. Failure to fulfill the above-mentioned obligation, due to financial expenses claimed by the company, indicates lowering of the value of the rights of the data subjects, whose personal data are being processed by the Company, in relation to the value of company's finances – which cannot be considered as a valid argument in the light of the requirements of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 14

In connection with the Gladsaxe Municipality, it inspected whether the controller withdrew terminated employees' access rights to its electronic case and document management system (SBSYS). The inspection showed that the controller had a comprehensive information security handbook regulating access rights management. However, in one instance, the DPA found that the controller did not follow the procedure of reviewing whether terminated employees still had an active user account. As a result, the DPA also assumed that the user [X] had access to SBSYS even after the employee's resignation.","First, the DPA held that the controller must always identify data processing risks and implement appropriate security measures to protect the data subjects against those risks. Such security measures must typically ensure that access rights to systems are properly allocated so that only users with a work-related need are authorised to access the information. Second, the DPA considered that in addition to a procedure for disabling access rights upon termination of employment, there must be a control procedure that effectively follows up on whether the access was truly disabled.

Consequently, the DPA held that the Gladsaxe Municipality did not take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks involved in the municipality's processing of personal data under Article 32(1) GDPR.

"In September 2021, the Hungarian DPA initiated an ex officio investigation against Budapest Bank Zrt. (hereinafter the Bank) related to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software applied to the audio recordings of customer service telephone conversations between May 2018 and the start of the investigation.

According to the Bank, the software used speech signal processing based on AI to identify periods of silence, different voices talking at the same time, key words, and emotional elements (such as voice speed, volume and pitch) within the recorded sound files in order to identify customer dissatisfaction. Once the software had made an automated decision to identify calls according to these criteria, a Bank employee then listened to the recordings, and made call-backs to customers in order to handle and attempt to resolve any customer dissatisfaction issues.

The Bank stated that its legal basis for this processing was based on legitimate interest, and its purpose was to conduct call quality control, to prevent complaints and customer churn, as well as to increase efficiency.

The Bank stated that customers were informed at the beginning of the calls that they were being recorded, but admitted that they did not inform them that the AI software would be used to analyse the calls, since detailed information in this regard would make the introduction to the calls too long, outlasting many of the simple queries made by customers when calling the Bank. The Bank also claimed that the system did not store any identifiable personal data, or perform automated decision-making in order to create personal profiles.

Additionally, in a Data Protection Impact Assessment carried out by the Bank, the Data Protection Officer stated that: “The purpose of the processing is lawful on the basis of the rights of the data subjects and the business interests of the Bank, there is no direct or indirect legal prohibition. The processing is high-risk for several reasons, in particular the novelty of the technology used, as the audio recordings are analysed and findings are made automatically by artificial intelligence. The aggregate data is suitable for profiling or scoring for both sets of data subjects [customers and employees], and although no automated decision making is involved, the data processing may have legal effects on the data subjects. The high risk is mitigated by the controller through measures identified in the impact assessment, such as human decision-making at the end of automated processing. The exercise of data subjects' rights is ensured in accordance with standard practice.”","Personal data

The NAIH first established that the software processed personal data since the data subject was indeed identifiable within this processing, due to the fact that the customer service calls are assigned a unique internal identification number that can be linked to the both the caller and the customer service employee. According to the NAIH, this processing was analogous to case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union C-582/14, which established that dynamic IP addresses are also personal data.

The NAIH also stated that the use of AI to identify emotional states should be considered processing of a sensitive nature, and could fall under the special category of personal data within the meaning of Article 9(1) GDPR in certain cases. However, the NAIH held that in this specific case Article 9(1) GDPR did not apply to the processing, since the voice analysis did not produce data that in itself could uniquely identify a data subject (and therefore could not be considered biometric data), and due to the fact that no meaningful inference as to the physical or mental state of health of the data subject could be drawn from the result of the processing.

Automated decision-making and profiling

The NAIH held that automated decision-making was carried out in this case, since it is not a prerequisite that the software makes the decision itself, and that it is sufficient if the processing is intended to produce an outcome that influences the decision-makers. The NAIH also established that profiling also took place according to the definition in Article 4(4) GDPR, since the prioritisation of dissatisfied customers based on keywords and emotions implies the evaluation of personal aspects cited in this provision.

Based on these assessments, and the fact that this is a novel technology, the NAIH noted that the processing created increased risks to fundamental rights, which also imply increased responsibilities on the controller. Therefore, the NAIH held that  before rolling out the automated voice analysis using emotional AI, the Bank should have assessed whether the processing was feasible under the current technical and social circumstances, and taken into consideration appropriate safeguards to comply with data protection laws and the principle of data protection by design. Based on these considerations, the NAIH held that the Bank’s failure to carry out these obligations constituted a violation of Articles 24(1) GDPR, 25(1) and 25(2) GDPR.

Lack of proper information and right to object

The NAIH noted that no information was given to the data subjects regarding the voice analysis, in particular about the specific types of data processed, as well as how their emotional reactions were processed and assessed. According to the NAIH, this constituted a breach of Articles 12(1), 13, 5(1) and 5(2) GDPR.

Furthermore, according to its previous assessments regarding automated decision-making and profiling, the NAIH held that absence of information given to data subjects regarding their right to object lead to a breach of Article 21 GDPR. Additionally, the NAIH also considered that processing for customer retention purposes constituted a marketing purpose similar to customer acquisition, and that therefore the Bank violated data subjects’ right to object under Article 21(2) GDPR as well.

Balancing of interests and lawfulness of processing

The NAIH held that the Bank had provided no concrete evidence that it had carried out an adequate balance of interests between its claimed legitimate interest to carry out the processing, and the rights of the data subjects involved.

The NAIH noted that according to the technical documentation provided by the Bank, the effectiveness of the emotion analysis software is actually relatively low, and that the Bank had failed to prove that, in its current form, its use was suitable to achieve its proposed objectives in a way that was proportionate to the effect on data subjects’ rights. The NAIH also noted that the Bank had not demonstrated that any alternatives to this processing were considered.

The NAIH also cited the European Data Protection Board and European Data Protection Supervisor’s Joint Opinion 5/2021 on the Artificial Intelligence Act, which states that “the use of AI to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, except for certain well-specified use-cases, namely for health or research purposes.” Based on these criteria, the NAIH concluded that the Bank’s stated efficiency purposes were not proportionate to justify the use of a form of data processing that EU data protection bodies have considered undesirable and constitute a high risk to data subjects' fundamental rights.

The NAIH also noted that not only the voices of the Bank's customers were analysed, but also the voices of its employees. The NAIH stated that although monitoring performance and quality assurance may give rise to legitimate interests in certain circumstances according to labour law, the question of suitability and proportionality was also relevant in this case, especially because employees are in a vulnerable position in the context of a labour relationship. The NAIH established that these factors were not taken into account due to the Bank's failure to conduct an adequate balance of interests, and that an adequate system of guarantees was not provided for employees.

Therefore, the NAIH held that the bank could not claim legitimate interest as a valid legal basis under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (or any other legal basis listed in Article 6(1) GDPR) for the processing in question. It therefore held that the Bank had violated Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1) GDPR and 6(4) GDPR.

Fine and order to comply with GDPR

Based on these considerations, the NAIH imposed a fine of HUF 250,000,000 (approximately €700,000) on the Bank, and ordered the Bank to cease its use of AI to analyse emotions in the recordings of customer service calls unless it provided proof, within 60 days, that: an appropriate scope of data was defined; a proper data impact assessment was carried out; and a valid legal basis was provided which ensured that data subjects’ rights are protected to the maximum extent possible.

With regard to the Bank's employees, the NAIH held that processing should be limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is intended, and that they should be provided with appropriate information, indicating the assessment criteria and consequences, and including a specific balancing of interests that addresses their vulnerability due to the nature of their labour relationship, with appropriate internal safeguards.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24, Article 25"

In its investigations, the DPA found that the email contained the general terms and conditions of the NMBS, instructions on how to use the railway pass correctly and Covid related information. However, the communication also included information of promotional nature and no unsubscribe button or link was provided. In the proceedings, the controller brought forward that the email was intended to remind the recipients to always ensure their safety when traveling and to remind them of the contractual conditions. It, therefore, considered the email as necessary for the performance of the contracts concluded with the ticket holders under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.","The DPA rejected the argument of the controller that sending an email with promotional content was necessary for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.

"The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) (the controller) received a request for access to documents from a journalist regarding information collected via its whistleblower scheme. On 31 May 2020, the FSA complied with the request under The Public Access to Information Act after removing the identifiable personal data relating to the reporting individuals. On 6 June 2020, one of the whistleblowers complained with the FSA that the journalist contacted them by email. The FSA investigated the matter and learned that, due to a software feature, it was possible to unredact the blackened parts and extract the supposedly anonymised information. After learning about the data breach, the Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) assessed whether the controller implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing.","The DPA held that processing information received via a whistleblower scheme poses a higher risk to data subjects' rights. Therefore, the appropriate security measure must ensure that material passed on to others does not contain personal data that could reveal their identities. According to the DPA, especially in such cases, the controller must choose an anonymisation method that does not leave traces of the removed personal data, not even in metadata. As a result, it should not be easy to circumvent the redaction with standardised tools. The DPA established that the controller's internal policies were not clear and precise enough to ensure that the caseworkers adequately anonymise personal data. Also, the peer training did not provide appropriate security by providing clear and accurate instructions. Moreover, the DPA noted that the controller lacked the necessary understanding of which methods it must implement to remove information from the documents, including the metadata, so that the information can no longer be retrieved. Consequently, the DPA reprimanded the controller for violating Article 32(1) GDPR by not taking appropriate organisational and technical measures to ensure a level of security that matches the risks involved in the processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"A former employee lodged a complaint with the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) about the unlawful forwarding of and access to their email inbox after they had left a company. The data subject had objected to the processing, but the controller had declined to sufficiently assess their objection, or to stop the processing.

The DPA's investigation revealed that the controller had not actually enabled automatic forwarding of the data subject's particular email address. They had also deleted the data subject's inbox shortly after they had left the company. Thus, the controller argued that they had not accessed the data subject's emails in any way.

However, in 2018 the company had enabled functionality that would retrieve and forward emails with certain keywords sent to non-registered email addresses belonging to their domain, to one collective inbox. The reason for this was evidently that a customer had once sent an email to an incorrect address and this functionality could mitigate the risk of not receiving customer emails. This also meant that even though the controller had deleted the data subject's inbox, emails sent to their address could still be routed to the company's collective inbox. This had happened once, according to the controller.","The DPA noted that for automatic forwarding of emails to take place, it is not a condition that the email address must exist, as long as emails are actually being forwarded, which had happened in this case. They also referred to practice from the Norwegian Privacy Appeals Board (Personvernnemnda) concluding that automatic forwarding of employee emails is equivalent to continuously monitoring their inbox. As per the Norwegian regulation concerning employers' right of access to employees' e-mail inboxes and other electronically stored material, this is only allowed under certain circumstances such as finding and solving data breaches.

Thus, the DPA held that the company had enabled automatic forwarding of the prior employee's emails without a legal basis as per Article 6(1)(f) GDPR and the national regulation § 2 second sentence. The DPA further held that the company had failed to inform the data subject about this processing, thus violating Article 13 GDPR and the national regulation § 3. As per the national regulation, the correct legal basis for this processing would have been Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, where a controller is required to allow for objections as per Article 21 GDPR. Since the controller in this case had ignored the data subject's objection, the DPA also held that they had violated Article 21 GDPR. Finally, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 24 GDPR for lack of technical and organisational measures, including conducting a risk assessment, and for the lack of internal policies and procedures (internal controls).

For these violations, the DPA intends to fine the controller €29,376 (NOK 300,000) and requires them to improve the company's policies and procedures for accessing current and prior employees' email inboxes, in line with Article 24(2) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24"
"In 2018, the AEPD (Spain) received a complaint which raised doubts about whether Google LLC (controller) was handling requests to remove content in a legally correct manner. The complaint asserted that Google LLC, which is based in Mountain View California USA, was unlawfully sending copies of removal requests by users to a third party (the “Lumen Project”). This triggered a broader investigation of the AEPD into the way how Google handles removal requests and the right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR. In its investigation the AEPD found that Google provides a webpage named “Removing Content From Google” where a user can request the removal of content from the various Google services (33 at the time of writing). In the first step, the user had to select the particular Google service it wanted data to be removed from. In the second step, the user had to choose between predefined grounds for the request. Among these predefined grounds (which specific grounds are listed depends on the selected service in step one) are e.g. defamation, copyright infringement, harassment and personal information. The AEPD took special notice of some of these predefined grounds: e.g. when having selected “Google Search”, a user had, among others, the following three options of predefined grounds: “Remove personal information from Google under product policies”, “Legal personal information issue: request removal of my personal information from Google’s search results”, “Other legal issue: report content for a legal reason not already listed”. The AEPD further established in its investigation that, only if the user selected the right predefined grounds, he or she was provided with the link to the web form “EU Privacy Removal”. This was the only form which Google treated as a request to erasure under Article 17 GDPR. Furthermore, Google did not provide a link to this form in its privacy policy but rather linked to the web page “Removing Content From Google”.

By looking at this system, the AEPD also found – as the complaint asserted – that Google was sending removal requests, except the ones made under Article 17 GDPR, to the “Lumen Project”. The Lumen Project is a project of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society of the Harvard University which is collecting removal requests from different providers in a publicly accessible database. A typical entry in the database contains a summary of the request and a link to the original content. Before the user submitted a request for removal on the page “Removing Content From Google” he or she was informed by a banner that a copy of the request may be sent to the Lumen project for publication and that Lumen will redact the personal information. However, the AEPD found that the automated redaction process implemented by the Lumen Project often did not work, leaving personal data included in the requests unredacted in the database.

At the start of the proceedings, the AEPD forwarded the complaint to the DPC (Ireland). After one year, the DPC decided that it did not consider itself competent to handle the complaint since Google LLC and not Google Ireland Ltd was the controller of the processing in question.

Google LLC notably argued in the proceedings that the AEPD violated the consistency mechanism because it forwarded the case to the DPC only at the beginning of the proceedings – where only a violation of Article 6 GDPR was alleged – but not after having broadened the investigation to include a violation of Article 17 GDPR. Furthermore, it argued that the transfer of the requests to the Lumen Project were lawful under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR since the Lumen Project pursues educational, research and transparency purposes with the database.","The AEPD found that Google LLC violated Articles 6 and 17 GDPR and, therefore, fined Google LLC €5,000,000 for each violation (€10,000,000 in total) and ordered it to bring its processing into compliance with the GPDR according to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR.

First, the AEPD established that the GDPR was applicable under Article 3(1) GPDR or, if not, at least Article 3(2)(a) GDPR would apply. Regarding Article 3(1) GDPR, the AEPD determined that the subsidiaries of the controller maintained in various member states can be considered establishments within the meaning of GDPR as clarified by Recital 22. Moreover, by referring to the judgement of the CJEU C-131/12 (GOOGLE SPAIN), the DPA concluded that the processing in question took place “in the context of the activities of an establishment” because the purposes of the European establishments is to promote and sell the Google services in the respective member states. It is not necessary that the processing is carried out by the establishment itself but it is sufficient that the processing and the establishment located in the EU are inextricably linked.

Second, the AEPD rejected the argument of the controller that it had violated the consistency mechanism by emphasizing that the proceedings were directed against Google LLC and not Google Ireland Ltd and, consequently, the consistency mechanism did not apply. It further underpinned its position by referring to the Privacy Policy of Google. It found that before Google introduced Google Ireland as a controller in its privacy policy by change of 22th January 2019, Google LLC was the responsible entity for Google services in Europe. Moreover, the AEPD reasoned, even after this date Google LLC remained the controller in Europe at least for the services of “Google Search” and “Google Maps” as stated in its privacy policy. It also highlighted that “Google Search” and “Google Maps” seem to be listed as examples in the privacy policy, implying that there may be other products or services than the two expressly mentioned for which GOOGLE LLC is the responsible entity.

Third, the AEPD found that there was no legal basis under Article 6 GDPR for the transfer of the removal requests to the Lumen project. It held that the submission of a removal request could not be construed as consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR since the banner showed by Google lacked essential information, such as the purpose of the transfer to the Lumen Project, and, therefore, users could not make a sufficiently informed decision. Furthermore, it reasoned that the user could not even make a decision not to consent, since there was no option to submit the removal request without having it send to the Lumen Project. The AEPD also held that the requirements of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR were not met because it was not necessary for the purposes stated by Google that the Lumen Project receives the personal data contained in the removal requests. It found that Google should have anonymized the data before transferring it to the Lumen project. Moreover, the AEPD even reasoned that Google had no legitimate interest for the transfer in the first place because it did not disclose the legitimate interests pursued to the data subjects, which deprived them of the possibility to contest Google’s assessment.

Fourth, the AEPD held that Google LLC violated Article 17 GDPR by hindering data subjects from exercising their right to erasure due to the complexity of its removal system. The DPA especially criticized that there was no option in the removal procedure which was clearly labeled as “erasure according to Article 17 GDPR” and that the Privacy Policy did not include a direct link to the correct request form but only a link to the page “Removing Content From Google”.

Fifth, when determining the amount of the fine, the DPA especially considered as aggravating factors that the Lumen Project resides in a non-member state, that the data subjects had no opportunity to object to the transfer, that the infringement lasted over a long period, since it started even before the GDPR came into effect, and that the database of the Lumen Project was publicly accessible. The DPA further rejected Google's notion to consider the absence of benefits from the unlawful processing as a mitigating factor.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17, Article 58, Article 83"
"In February 2021, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) notified the Norwegian DPA Datatilsynet about a personal data breach where they had published CVs without a legal basis. The DPA had also received 18 complaints from data subjects regarding the incident.

NAV, the controller, has since 2001 had online solutions for making job applicants' CVs available for logged-in employers. In February 2019, they launched a new online tool where job applicants could voluntarily register their CVs. The controller, however, also made these available to employers through a candidate search, by default, including CVs where the data subjects had not given their consent. In addition, the controller had required data subjects to publish their CV to receive certain social services and benefits.

In 2020, a data subject contacted NAV's Data Protection Officer about the processing and, consequently, the controller launched an internal review. They concluded that they lacked a legal basis as per Article 6(1) GDPR for publishing the CVs, as far back as 2001. The controller had assessed legal bases in national laws pertaining to them, but found that these could not be relied upon for this particular situation. The controller now also realised that they did not either have a legal basis for requiring data subjects to publish their CV like this to receive certain social services and benefits.

The CVs contained information about data subjects' name, place of residence, date of birth, telephone number, e-mail address, education, work and other relevant experience, courses, driver's licenses, access to vehicles, various approvals and certifications, language, stated competencies and job wishes. This information is subject to confidentiality as per national regulations applicable to the controller.

The controller informed the DPA that 535,900 CVs was part of the 2019 system and they estimated that the maximum number of affected data subjects was 1,8 million. When the controller realized the breach, they notified the DPA and tried to inform every affected data subject personally by email or letter, as well as via their website.","The DPA held that the controller had violated Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 6(3) GDPR, thus also Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, for lack of legal basis for publishing CVs online. Further, as the controller is subject to a national regulation stipulating that the information in the CVs is confidential, the DPA held that they had violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

For these violations, the DPA fined NAV (the controller) €486,700 (NOK 5,000,000).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"An employee (the data subject) had quit their job and was supposed to assist the employer (the controller) during the notice period. However, due to disagreements, the controller blocked the data subject's access to email and business systems and enabled automatic forwarding of emails to the general manager of the company.

The data subject objected to this processing, but the controller upheld it for several weeks and only stopped it when the general manager realized it could be problematic. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) launched an investigation after receiving both a notification from the controller, as well as a complaint from the data subject.

The controller explained to the DPA that they had enabled automatic forwarding of the emails because the data subject had refused to enable an out of office reply. They further argued that this was necessary to uphold customer relations and daily operations, and because they had discovered that the data subject had violated work duties a few months earlier.

The controller also claimed that the data subject had consented to the processing, however this was denied by the data subject and the controller was unable to document their assertion.","The DPA held that the controller lacked a legal basis as per Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for accessing and monitoring the data subject's email inbox, that they had failed to provide required information to the data subject as per Article 13 GDPR and for failure to assess the data subject's objection as per Article 21 GDPR. For this, the DPA fined the controller €9,775 and required them to improve internals controls for employee emails as per Article 24 GDPR.

On the legal basis

First, the DPA assessed if the controller had a legal basis as per a national (Norwegian) regulation concerning employers' access to employees' inboxes and other electronically stored material, which allows such processing if one of two possible conditions are fulfilled. First, the DPA found that ""upholding customer relations and daily operations"" and ""suspicion of violations of work duties"", as argued by the controller, are legitimate purposes as per the regulation §2(1). However, this only allows for single accesses for a specified purpose. Automatic enabling of forwarding is considered as continuous surveillance and the processing could therefore not be based on this condition.

Continuous surveillance is regulated by §2(2), but solely for purposes of administrating the computer network or to uncover or solve security breaches in the network. Consequently, the processing could not either be based on this condition.

Further, the DPA found that the conditions in Article 6(1) GDPR was not fulfilled. The only available legal ground for this type of processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, where three conditions must be fulfilled: the processing must be necessary for legitimate interests, and these interests must outweigh the rights and freedoms of the data subject.

The DPA had already concluded that the purposes were legitimate. However, they held that the purposes could have been achieved by less privacy-invasive measures, for example by deactivating the email inbox and/or enable automatic forwarding themselves. Consequently, the DPA held that the controller lacked a valid legal basis as per Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

On the right to object

The DPA found that the controller was unable to demonstrate that they had considered the data subject's objection, or that they had conducted a specific legitimate interest assessment in line with Article 21 GDPR.

On the obligation to inform data subjects

The DPA held that it is highly likely that the controller had violated the right to information as per Article 13 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 13, Article 21, Article 24"
"The case concerned a group of Italian hospitals ""Azienda ospedaliera di Perugia"" (the controller), a provider of web applications ""ISWEB S.p.A."" (processor), and a host service provider ""Seeweb S.r.l."" (sub-processor). ISWEB provided a web application to the hospitals for collecting and managing employees’ whistleblowing reports. ISWEB contracted the company Seeweb for hosting the whistleblowing application. ISWEB neither obtained the prior written authorisation from the controller for engaging a sub-data processor, nor formalised its processor-sub-processor relationship with Seeweb through a contract or other legal act.

ISWEB claimed that the object of its contract with the hospitals was not the processing of whistleblower reports but the provision of technological infrastructure. ISWEB argued that neither itself nor Seeweb processed additional data which, associated with IP addresses, would allow users who accessed the whistleblower platform to be identified or made identifiable. That was because the whistleblower reports were encrypted with a key exclusively available to the hospitals. Therefore, ISWEB claimed that it was not required to obtain specific or general authorisation from the hospitals nor contractually impose the same data protection guarantees on Seeweb as imposed by its own relationship with the hospitals.","The DPA found that ISWEB violated Article 28(2) GDPR and Article 28(4) GDPR as a processor on behalf of the hospitals and Article 28(1) GDPR and Article 28(3) GDPR as controller delegating to Seeweb.

The DPA rejected ISWEB's reasoning that data processed by the provider of the hosting platform (Seeweb) does not constitute personal data under the GDPR. According to the DPA, even though the data was encrypted and the keys were at the sole disposal of the controller, such data is still related to identifiable physical persons (Recital 83, Article 4(1) GDPR, Article 25 GDPR and Article 32(1)(a) GDPR).

Moreover, a hosting service provider, even though it does not have direct access to personal data on a platform, stores such data on its infrastructure. It is therefore required to ensure the integrity and the availability of the data through appropriate technical and organisational measures (Guidelines 7/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, EDPB 7 July 2021).

The DPA noted that ISWEB set up a processor agreement pursuant to Article 28 GDPR with Seeweb regarding data processing carried out by ISWEB as the controller. However, the agreement was formalised only after the investigation of the DPA. Therefore, the DPA also held ISWEB responsible for the violation of Article 28(1) GDPR and Article 28(3) GDPR.

"On 16 January 2019, the Executive-committee of the Belgian DPA (GBA) started an investigation on the use of cookies on Belgian media websites. The controller in this case is Roularta Media Group.

The investigation revealed the following potential violations. First, the placement of unnecessary cookies prior to consent of the data subject. Second, the placement of statistical cookies without consent. Third, pre-ticked boxes to grant consent for cookies from partners. Fourth, the placement of a disclaimer for third-party cookies. Fifth, false and inadequate information in their privacy policy. Sixth, unjustified retention periods for the storage of cookies. Lastly, revoking consent was impossible. In fact, this placed more cookies. The controller argued that statistical cookies are used for aggregated basic statistics, necessary for the business model of the website. No personal data is being processed for this activity, as such, the GDPR does not apply.

The controller argued that regarding the statistical cookies, the personal data was anonymised. The controller further argued that the Belgian DPA did not provide adequate guidelines for companies to comply with the GDPR. The controller refers to e.g. the French and Dutch DPA, who have provided this.","Regarding the placement of cookies, the DPA first noted that cookies can only be placed without prior consent when they are (1) strictly necessary for the transmission of communication or (2) to provide a service that is explicitly requested by the user. The DPA held that the controller violated Article 6(1)(a) and Article 5(3) ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC, as some of the cookies placed without prior consent were found to be not strictly necessary. The controller even admitted to the placement of unnecessary cookies without obtaining prior consent.

Regarding the placement of statistical cookies in particular, the DPA noted - with reference to her decision in 12/2019 - that these also require prior consent. The DPA observed that the placement and reading of these cookies on the terminal equipment of users revealed their IP-addresses to the controller. The DPA disregarded the defence of the controller that the IP-addresses were anonymised, and found that they were instead pseudonimised. This makes the data subjects indirectly identifiable and thus the GDPR applicable. The DPA therefore held that the controller violated Article 6(1)(a) and Article 5(3) ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC by not obtaining prior consent.

Regarding the pre-ticked boxes for the cookies from partner companies, the DPA argued that this cannot constitute lawful consent by the definition of Article 4(11) (and with reference to Planet49). The DPA thus found another violation of Article 6(1)(a).

The DPA held that regarding the disclaimer placed on their website for third-party cookies, the controller violated the principle of accountability laid down in Article 5(2). The DPA stated that controllers are responsible for compliance with the GDPR and the demonstration thereof (Article 24).

The DPA found that the privacy policy of the controller contained false, incomplete and insufficient information. The DPA therefore held that the controller violated Article 12(1), as it did not communicate the information referred to in of Article 13 and Article 14 in a ""concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form"". The DPA furthermore held that the controller violated the principle of storage limitation laid down in Article 5(1)(e) by not proactively defining the criteria for the storage of cookies.

Lastly, the DPA found that the controller violated Article 7(3), as withdrawing consent was made impossible by the controllers cookie-management tool. The DPA noted that withdrawing consent must be as easy as providing consent for users.

The DPA found that the alleged absence of concrete guidelines is not a valid argument against a violation of data protection legislation. The DPA held that it is the responsibility of the controller to comply with the law and further noted that numerous guidelines for companies to ensure compliance with the GDPR already exist.

The DPA fined the controller €50.000. The DPA further ordered the controller to get its processing of personal data - for which a violation was established - in compliance with the GDPR within 3 months.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 24"
"The controller is the Italian administration that manages insurances for work injuries (INAIL). INAIL uses “Sportello Virtuale Lavoratori” (SVL), a platform that allows employees access their files and ongoing procedures before INAIL. The data subjects are the users of SVL.

The decision includes three separate data breaches, where users of SVL saw personal data of other users instead of their own after logging in. In total, 10 data subjects' personal data was disclosed to unauthorised third parties. On one occasion, the user was even able to download other data subjects’ personal data. In another instance the data subjects were deemed not identifiable, as it did not include their name.

INAIL suspended SVL after the first data breach. INAIL also implemented new technical and organisational measures. However, they did not prevent the next data breaches. Moreover, the cause of the first breach was not identified. INAIL claimed that it could be caused by a malfunction of software provided by third parties over which INAIL has no control.

INAIL argued that the data breaches were related to exceptional circumstances, unpredictable. INAIL further argued that the third data breach was caused by a mere human error. They should therefore not be deemed as indicator of non-adequate security measures.","The DPA held that the technical and organisational measures in place when the first two data breaches occurred, were not adequate considering the risk enshrined into the data processing at stake (Article 32 GDPR). The DPA stated that Article 32 requires the controller to ensure continuous confidentiality of the data and the integrity of the system through which personal data is processed. Moreover, the controller has an obligation to deploy procedures to test, verify and evaluate the effectiveness of such measures. INAIL was neither able to prevent the security violations nor detect their technical origins. This resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of third parties, including those relating to health (Article 4(10)). The DPA held that this constitutes a violation of Article 6(1)(e) and Article 9(2)(g). The DPA stated that this is also a violation of the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency  (Article 5(1)(a)), and of the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)).

Nevertheless, the DPA considered the breaches isolate events concerning a limited number of data subjects. Moreover, the data subjects were not identifiable in some instances. Therefore the violation did not have a big impact on them.

Finally, the DPA considered the security measures adequate at the time of the last data breach, as a human error was the origin of the breach.

The DPA fined INAIL €50,000 for violating Article 5(1)(a) and (f), Article 6(1)(e), Article 9(2)(g) and Article 32, as well as articles 2-ter and 2-sexies of the Italian national law on data protection (D.lgs. 196/2003).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 32"

The DPA noted that public entities can lawfully process personal data for the fulfilment of a legal obligation or for the performance of a task in the public interest pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) and (e) GDPR. The DPA followed that even if the processing is lawful, it must also be in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 5. Since no indication of a legal basis for the placement of the videos on its Facebook page was found (Article 6 and Article 2-ter of Code Privacy), the DPA held that the processor violated the principles of ""lawfulness, correctness and transparency"" (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR).

The DPA further held that the controller violated the principle of ""purpose limitation"" (Article 5(1)(b)). The DPA found no indication of any compatibility with the purposes for which the personal data was previously collected (detection of illegal activities) for further processing (publication on Facebook).

The controller did not notify the DPA of the data breach.

When the data breach was discovered by the DPA in the course of an investigation, the controller reasoned that it did not notify the DPA because the data breach did not entail a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The controller further stated that it had notified the data subject of the loss of his employment certificate and he did not make any claims against the company in this respect.

Lastly, revoking consent was impossible.","The DPA held that the controller violated Article 6(1)(a) by placing not strictly necessary cookies without obtaining prior consent. The DPA noted that statistical cookies also require consent under the current legal framework. Furthermore, the controller did not provide any evidence for the legitimate interest regarding the social-network cookies. However, the DPA will take into account that the controller now (allegedly) has another legal basis for the social-network and analytical cookies.

Regarding the qualification of 'further browsing' as consent, the DPA stated that this can be seen as active behaviour as referred to in Planet 49 in specific situations. However the act of simply scrolling, is not. A computer action (e.g. a mouse-click) could change this. The DPA further noted that it also lacked the requirement for consent to be specific. The DPA therefore held that the controller violated Article 6(1)(a) (jo Article 4(11) and Article 7(1)).

Regarding the pre-ticked boxes for third-party cookies, the DPA argued that this cannot constitute lawful consent by the definition of Article 4(11). The DPA thus found another violation of Article 6(1)(a).

The DPA further held that the controller violated Article 4(11), Article 12(1), Article 13 and Article 14 as their cookie policy was incomplete (it only mentioned 13 of the 500 partners). Furthermore, it was not sufficiently accessible and and/or in the data subject's language.

Lastly, the DPA found that the controller violated Article 7(3), for the placement of additional cookies after withdrawing consent.

Consequently, the DPA launched an investigation and sent a request for information to the developer of the extension, who failed to reply. The DPA sent several requests and reminders and, finally, an advance notification of a decision, but the developer never replied back. The data subject, however, provided further comments to the complaint and, following this, the DPA found that they had enough information to be able to issue a final decision.","First, the DPA assessed the territorial scope of the GDPR.

Second, the DPA assessed the material scope and found that Shinigami Eyes processes several types of personal data as per Article 4(1) GDPR, including the name or online identifier of social network users, their posts/behaviour and the color indicating whether they are transphobic or trans-friendly.

Third, the DPA found that Shinigami Eyes is the controller for this processing as they determine the purpose of the extension, as well as the means to be utilised and implemented.

This exposed the email addresses of all recipients to each other.

The controller stated that because of the limited scope of the violation, there is no concrete risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. It further argued 193 email addresses did not contain references to any names, so they were not personal data. The controller also stated that it happened due to a human error.

The DPA argued that a data subject could not reasonably expect large amounts of its personal data to be analyzed by the controller to better target its advertising. Third-party data enrichment, like the use of commercial credit reporting agency data, further overrides the interest of the controller and tips the balancing test in favor of the data subject.

"The controller, Accor, is a large, multinational chain that operates hotels in 110 countries. Between December 2018 and September 2019, the French DPA (CNIL) received several complaints concerning the controller's various potential violations of the GDPR.

On 24 Feburary 2020, the CNIL conducted an investigation of the controller's website. Users supplied their contact information, including email address, when they registered an account with the controller. The registration process featured a pre-ticked box indicating consent to receive promotional materials. Data subjects subsequently started receiving these promotional materials in their inboxes. They were unable to unsubscribe from direct marketing emails, as various technical glitches prevented the emails' ""unsubscribe"" button from working. Several million people received these emails at valid addresses, though the CNIL's published decision redacted the exact amount.

Additionally, the website did not provide data subjects with information about the controller's contact details, the purposes of processing for the data collected, the legal basis for processing, the period for which the data would be retained, potential transfers, or the right to lodge a complaint under the GDPR, and there was no link to a privacy policy that might contain this information.

The CNIL also received one complaint regarding difficulties encountered exercising the right of access to personal banking data processed by the controller. The controller had failed to respond to an access request after locking a data subject's account for suspected fraudulent activity even after data subject verified their identity.

Finally, for the controller to access the ""Adobe Campaign"" account responsible for managing these email communications, a weak password consisting of seven capital letters and one special character was required, although access was only possible from a terminal connected to the ACCOR network.

Ten other supervisory authorities declared themselves to be concerned supervisory authorities, and the CNIL was also notified of five additional complaints by the supervisory authorities of Saarland, Spain, Ireland, Poland, and Lower Saxony. The controller's main establishment was determined to be in France, where more than half of its hotels were located. As such, the CNIL was the lead supervisory authority per Article 56(1) GDPR.","The CNIL found that the controller had committed a ""substantial"" infringement on data subjects' rights. By using a pre-ticked box indicating consent to receive direct marketing emails, the controller had failed to obtain a ""free, specific, and informed"" expression of consent before sending such marketing in violation of France's implementation of the ePrivacy Directive (Article L34-5 CPCE).

The CNIL held that the controller had also violated Articles 12 and 13 GDPR by failing to provide information about the details of processing or even a link to a privacy policy with such information when it collected customers' personal data. It had also violated Articles 12 and 15 for not responding to data subjects' access requests within one month after the receipt of those requests.

Further, the CNIL held that the controller had violated Articles 12 and 21 for not removing data subjects who had unsubscribed from its mailing list.

Finally, the CNIL held that the controller had violated Article 32 by protecting a massive volume of personal data with an eight-character password with only two different kinds of characters, thus not ensuring a strong enough password.

In assessing a fine, the CNIL took into account that the controller had suffered a 54% decline in turnover from 2019 to 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The controller had also cooperated fully with the CNIL, rectifying infringements throughout the course of the investigation, and the CNIL considered that some of the violations ""were not of a structural nature."" Thus, the CNIL held a fine of €100,000 was sufficient.

However, the Polish DPA (UODO) objected to the CNIL's draft decision, arguing that the amount of the fine, which was roughly 0.02% of the controller's estimated turnover in 2020, was too low to effectively deter other controllers from committing similar violations. The UODO wanted further information on the controller's turnover included in the draft decision, without which there was insufficient basis on which to calculate a fine. It argued that, with regard to proportionality, the draft decision did not provide evidence that a higher fine would irretrievably jeopardise the controller's viability, and it was required that there be ""objective evidence that the imposition of the fine would irretrievably expose the viability of the company concerned and would result in the loss of all the value of its assets.""

The CNIL did not implement the UODO's proposed changes, believing the proposed fine to be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive per Article 83(1) GDPR, and so the EDPB adopted a binding resolution in accordance with Article 65 GDPR to settle the dispute. The EDPB instructed the CNIL to take into account only the controller's most recent turnover without taking into account the drop between 2019 to 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, it found that, since the CNIL itself had called the controller's infringements ""substantial,"" a fine representing 0.02% of the controllers estimated turnover was not dissuasive. The lack of a deterrent and dissuasive fine posed risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, and accordingly, the EDPB instructed the CNIL to reassess the proposed fine, taking into account the relevant turnover in particular.

Following the EDPB's decision, the CNIL revised its initial figure and ultimately fined the controller €600,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 13, Article 15, Article 21, Article 32, Article 55, Article 83"
"Following a complaint filed by a data subject, the Romanian DPA started an investigation against CDI Transport, a passenger transport company (controller). The data subject complained that the controller's website did not include all the necessary information in its privacy policy required by the GDPR.

During the investigation, the company did not answer the DPA's request within the legal term.","The DPA found that the controller did not clearly inform the data subjects visiting its website about the personal data it processed, as the information required by Article 12-22 GDPR was not published on the website. This included information about the purpose of processing personal data, the legal basis, the controller's contact details, the retention period and the possibility for data subjects to exercise their rights.

As a result, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 12(1) GDPR. The DPA issued a warning against the controller and ordered it to ensure that the infromation required by Article 12 GDPR would be communicated in a concise, transparent and easily accessible manner.

In addition, the DPA fined the controller €7,000 for its lack of collaboration during the investigation. The controller neglegted to answer the DPA's request for information within the legal term, in violation of Article 58(1)(a) and (e) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 58"

During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller had installed CCTV cameras inside and outside its beauty salon, surveilling both its clients and its employees (data subjects) without clearly informing them.","The DPA noted that the data subject were not clearly informed about this data processing pursuant to the requirements of Article 12 and 13 GDPR. The DPA fined the controller approximately €1,500 for this violation.

Since the data subjects did not consent and there was no other legal basis for the surveillance, the controller would need to have a legitimate interest for these processing activities (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). The DPA noted that the controller did not provide any reason (such as previous incidents) to justify its legitimate interest regarding the excessive surveillance system. In particular, the controller failed to provide a reason that would override the interests of the data subjects. Thus, the processing activities were excessive and not limited to what was necessary to reach the desired purpose.

The DPA held that the controller violated Article 5(1)(a),(b) and (c) read in conjunction with Article 5(2) and 6 GDPR and imposed a fine of approximately €1,000.

This amounts to a total fine of €2,500.

The DPA also ordered to controller to:

* properly inform the data subjects according to the requirements of Articles 12-13;
* stop the video surveillance when there is no legal ground to do so;
* implement the necessary technical and organisational measures to lawfully manage the video surveillance; and
* to restrict the remote and continuous access to the video captions, and only allow accessing those captions in special cases such as incidents.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13"

"Mediconnect is an IT system offered by EG Digital Welfare ApS (the processor) and used by municipalities, regions, insurance companies, and specialist doctors to process personal data, including health information. In June 2021, the DPA received complaints about weak security in using the Mediconnect platform and decided to examine the matter. The investigation showed that users could access the system via a username and password. The users had an opportunity to use the Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) which uses claims-based authentication. However, not all users opted for it. In addition, the processor stored the passwords in plain text in a database which only employees with work-related needs could access.","The DPA held that where a processor provides an IT system used to process special categories of personal data via a network over which it has no control, an appropriate security measure would require a greater level of access control than a mere username and password. It could be, for example, a multi-factor authentication, certificates, tokens or a PKI solution. The DPA pointed out that a single-factor authentication entails a risk of access misuse and a risk of access being shared by several users. In that case, any access log is no longer effective because one cannot be sure who used which access.

Furthermore, the DPA also held that appropriate security would require using a recognised algorithm for irreversible encryption (e.g. hashing) of all passwords so that they are not stored and cannot be recovered in plain text. This rule applies regardless of the volume or nature of processed personal data. Because users tend to reuse their passwords across different online services, there is a risk that an unauthorised party could also combine the password with an email address to access data on other websites.

Consequently, the DPA reprimanded the processor for violating Article 32(1) GDPR and ordered it to encrypt all the passwords and improve its authentication process so that users can no longer rely merely on a username and password by 2 September 2022.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"Salling Group (the controller) is Denmark's largest retail group which serves 11 million customers per week. In 2021, they implemented a system allowing customers to shop on its websites (namely Føtex, Bilka, Netto, Salling and Carl Junior) using the same username and password (Salling Group profile). The controller also established a monitoring tool to record incidents and events about customers' access to the websites. However, in May 2022, the controller found that the monitoring system's log file stored customers' usernames and unencrypted passwords for the website ""hjem.foetex.dk"" by mistake. As a result, 146 people employed by the controller had technical access to the data. If an unauthorised person used the login credentials, they could access the customer's name, address, email address, telephone number, masked card information and purchase history. The controller reported the breach to the DPA.","The DPA held that in systems with confidential information about a large number of users, higher requirements must be placed on the controller to prevent unauthorised access to the data. In particular, the controller must store passwords in irreversible encrypted form at all times and in a way that ensures that they are not immediately readable and that it is not possible to recreate the password in a readable format. The DPA also emphasised that storing passwords in plain text poses a high risk to data subjects because they can be misused internally and because shopping platforms are known to be a common target of cyberattacks. Therefore, storing passwords in a readable format in a log file violates Article 32(1) GDPR. Consequently, the DPA reprimanded the Salling Group for the violation and ordered it to notify affected data subjects about the breach by 1 August 2022.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"The Icelandic DPA started an investigation into a genetic research company. More specifically, to assess the company's Data Protection Officer (DPO), as well as the performance of the DPO's tasks.

The DPA requested information from the company to determine if and how the company's DPO was compatible with Article 38 GDPR. The DPA stated that the decision to investigate the DPO  was made with the intention of ensuring compliance, not because it assumed the requirements of the GDPR were not being followed.

The DPA wrote two letters, but the company did not respond to any of them within the prescribed deadlines. After a phone call, the DPA received a response almost two months after the first letter had been sent.","After reviewing the responses from the controller, the Icelandic DPA concluded that there were no violations in relation to the obligations to appoint a DPO (Article 37), to involve the DPO in relevant matters (Article 38(1)), and to provide the DPO with the necessary resources (Article 38(2)).

However, the DPA held that the controller violated the obligation to ensure the DPO's independence pursuant to Article 38(3). The acting DPO at the time of the investigation also held the position of deputy CEO, senior lawyer and board member. The DPA held that that could lead to a conflict of interest.

The current DPO also held the position of senior lawyer. The DPA held that this also constituted a conflict of interest.

The DPA instructed the controller to ensure that the acting DPO would not be responsible for other tasks and duties that may lead to a conflict of interest.

"The Finnish DPA was notified that the social and health authority of the city of Oulu (the controller) had required persons applying to become foster parents to request access to their personal data processed by the police and to provide this information to the controller.

The DPA had asked the controller to explain for what purpose it processed the personal data and why it required the data subjects to provide this information.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the information received from the police was required in the process of approving applicants as foster parents. The controller had to ensure that the conditions at the foster home were safe and stable and that the children placed in foster care received better care than at home. The controller claimed that the information about, among other things, domestic violence and disruptive behaviour was necessary because it hindered working as a foster parent.

The controller stated that the police did not disclose the information based solely on the consent of the data subject. For this reason, it had become a practice to request the information directly from persons applying to become foster parents.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the processing of personal data in accordance with Article 4(2) GDPR also covers situations where the controller requires the data subject to disclose documents containing personal data and where the controller reviews them.

The DPA stated that the objective of the right of access is the opportunity of the data subject to stay informed about the lawfulness of the processing and to confirm it. The DPA emphasised that public authorities may not require the data subject to provide them with information based on the data subject's access request, and thus may not use the right of access as a means of obtaining information.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 10 GDPR by requiring foster parent applicants to exercise their right of access, as it had no legal basis to process the personal data in question.

Another allegation concerned the case of storing employees' data about, among other things, resignations, contracts, written warnings, medical certificates and video surveillance recordings locally on a shared computer which was freely accessible to other employees.

The controller responded to the DPA that it carried out video surveillance in all its centres based on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to prevent crime, increase the safety of its employees and members, and prevent gross violations of its internal rules. The controller also claimed that it had informed its employees about the monitoring in the employment contract, the staff handbook, the privacy policy for employees and the controller's policy on video surveillance. In addition, the entrance areas had clear signs informing those coming in about video surveillance. As for the storing of employees' data locally on a shared computer, the controller stated that this occurred because of an error from the manager who saved the documents on the wrong drive. The controller dealt with the situation individually and improved its practices to prevent future mistakes.","The DPA held that the controller's video surveillance of the workplace complied with the GDPR because the controller had a legitimate interest in the processing, namely to prevent crime and to assert legal claims against its employees, the processing was not excessive, and the controller informed all data subjects about the monitoring.

Furthermore, it failed to take sufficient measures to ensure that its employees who had access to personal data did not process them unless instructed to do so pursuant to Article 32(4) and Article 29 GDPR.

The DPA then held that the use of processors had been lawful and that the relevant data processing agreements satisfied the requirements of Article 28 GDPR.

However, the DPA reprimanded the controller, partly for its lack of clear auditing procedures, and partly for not actually conducting audits in line with the routines that did exist. The DPA held that the accountability principle in Article 5 GDPR entails an obligation for the controller to oversee the security of the data processing operations performed by a processor. The DPA highlighted that entering into a data processing agreement that contains security obligations is not sufficient, and that the controller must also oversee that the processor actually adheres to the agreement.

"The Chief National Surveyor (the controller) accidentally disclosed land and mortgage register numbers on its website. The numbers were publicly available for about 48 hours. The controller did not notify the DPA and the affected data subjects of this event.

In the investigation that followed, the controller claimed first, that the data disclosed were not personal data. Second, it argued that their publication was lawful and therefore did not constitute a data breach. Lastly, the controller submitted that, in any case, this disclosure did not entail any risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons due to the short-term nature of the disclosure and the availability of the data in other sources. For this reason, the controller deemed that there was no need to notify the DPA and the affected data subjects under Articles 33(1) and 34(1) GDPR.","The Polish DPA held, first, that land and mortgage register numbers constitute personal data. The land and mortgage register of natural persons contains, among others, first names, surnames, parents' names, PESEL numbers (i.e. an eleven-digit numeric symbol, uniquely identifying a natural person, containing the date of birth, serial number, gender and a control number), and real estate addresses. The land and mortgage register numbers consequently enabled anyone to identify persons whose data were included in the land and mortgage register. Thus, land and mortgage register number is information allowing one to indirectly identify a natural person.

Second, the Polish DPA held that the publication of the land and mortgage register numbers was not lawful. Whilst the Land and Mortgage Register Act provides for the land and mortgage register being public via a dedicated ICT system, it does not refer to disclosing such information on publicly available websites. Similarly, the Geodetic and Cartographic Act states that the relevant data could only be shared by the district governor upon request. Lastly, the Regulations of the Minister of Development, Labor and Technology, an executive act that the controller also referred to in its submissions, cannot take precedence over the Geodetic and Cartographic Act and hence provide for universal access to the data concerned. Consequently, the Polish DPA held that the accidental disclosure of land and mortgage register numbers on the controller’s website constituted a personal data breach within the meaning of Article 4(12) GDPR.

Third, in considering the failure to notify the DPA of the data breach, the DPA found that the controller did not assess the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons based on objective criteria. The controller merely asserted that the land and mortgage register was public and the numbers were also available in other sources. The DPA noted that risk assessments should be made from the point of view of the data subject’s interest and not that of the controller. In addition, the DPA emphasized that the existence of private entities that run websites allowing access to the content of land and mortgage registers cannot serve as a justification for non-compliance with the law on the part of the controller. Considering the above and the fact that the controller did not demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that it was unlikely that this data breach could result in a risk to rights and freedoms of natural persons, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 33(1) GDPR by not notifying the DPA of the personal data breach.

Lastly, the DPA pointed out that the disclosure of a person’s PESEL number, together with their name and surname, could lead to identity theft. For this reason, there was a possibility of significant negative consequences for a large number of data subjects, and the likelihood of such a risk materializing was not low. There were also no factors reducing the probability of such negative consequences on the data subjects. Consequently, the DPA held that the personal data breach in question may have resulted in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects and the controller violated Article 34(1) GDPR by not notifying the affected data subjects of the breach, not even through a public announcement.

As a result, the DPA fined the controller PLN 60,000 (roughly € 12,773) and ordered the controller to communicate the personal data breach to the data subjects within 3 days from the date of notification of this decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34"

It included the data subject's first name, surname, address, PESEL number (i.e. an eleven-digit numeric symbol, uniquely identifying a natural person, containing the date of birth, serial number, gender and a control number) and health-related information, such as their diagnosis.

Since the first name of the data subject contained a typo, the controller considered that the data in question related to a non-existing person. For this reason, the controller decided that the incident was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject and did not notify the DPA or the data subject of the data breach.","The DPA held that there was a personal data breach consisting in the disclosure of the data subject's personal data to an unauthorised person. Despite the incorrectly entered first name of the data subject, the data subject could still be easily identified on the basis of their surname, their address and their PESEL number. Moreover, not only did the fact that the data contained health-related information contribute to the severity of the incident, it also increased the likelihood of identifying the data subject.

Furthermore, the DPA held that the controller's risk assessment incorrectly identified the risk posed by the data breach as too low. The DPA considered that due to the scope of the data, such as health-related data and PESEL number which could be used for identity theft, there was a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject.

Consequently, the DPA held that the controller violated Articles 33(1) and 34(1) GDPR by not notifying the DPA of the data breach and not communicating it to the data subject.

"The Municipality of Policoro (Basilicata), implemented the use of CCTV cameras to monitor and fight waste abandonment within its territory.  A data subject complained the Municipality had breached their data protection right of fair, transparent and lawful processing under art. 5(1)(a) as the sign signaling the CCTV monitoring referred to an outdated legislative decree.  They also alleged a breach of art. 5(1)(e) and art. 13 GDPR, in so far the municipality never defined a data retention period for each processing purpose pursued.  The last complaint moved forward by the data subject was that by being legally represented in Court by the same lawyer, who also acted as DPO of Policoro, the Municipality gave rise to a conflict of interest situation and breached art. 38(6) GDPR.

The Municipality argued that the claim had been done in front of the Justice of Peace, who had no competency to decide on issues of privacy.  It was also alleged the judgement only pertained an administrative matter, without rising any data protection concerns or a situation of conflict of interest with the Municipality's DPO.  The last argument alleged the processing and retention of the CCTV footage was related to illegal dumps within the municipal territory, meaning the filming had been carried out in the course of judicial police investigations and the data retention periods of the GDPR did not apply in this case.","The Italian DPA held that in this case the Municipality was carrying activities of data processing, by surveilling public entities by means of surveillance cameras.

It also noted, that in par. 41 of the Guidelines 3/2019 on the Processing of Personal Data by Video Devices, waste management is ""among the institutional activities entrusted to local authorities"". This means the surveillance done by the Municipality of Policoro, a task carried out in the public interest in connection with the exercise of official authority as per art.6(1)(e) GDPR, was unrelated to public security and/or judicial police and obliging the controller to comply with data protection principles.

The DPA found that the information provided in regards to the processing of personal data by means of surveillance cameras, did not meet the requirements of conciseness, transparency, intelligibility and easy readability contained in art. 5(1)(a) GDPR. The Municipality of Policoro had failed to provide suitable first-level information to the data subject, in so far the sign signaling the CCTV surveillance made reference to an outdated legislative decree (d.lgs 196/03) instead of the one currently in force (d.lgs 101/18).  Furthermore, the data controller failed to provide the data subject with an adequate notice on second-level processing of their data. The signage did not include information on the most suitable impacts of the processing or an indication of a website, where to consult an extended version of the explanation.

The DPA also found a violation of art. 13 GDPR as well as the principles of storage limitation and accountability in art. 5(1)(e) and art. 5(2). It stated that ""the longer the intended storage period (especially if longer than 72 hours), the more reasoned the analysis referring to the legitimacy of the purpose and necessity of storage must be"". In this case, the data controller not only failed to set a maximum retention period for the images taken for the purpose of combating illegal littering, but also established the administrative fines for the violation two months after the images were recorded. This did not allow for the data controller to respect the principle of accountability.

Lastly, the DPA addressed the alleged conflict of interest raised by the involvement of the Policoro's DPO in the legal proceedings brought against the data subject. The DPA ruled DPOs ""may perform other duties and functions,"" with the understanding that ""the controller must ensure that such duties and functions do not give rise to a conflict of interest."" The DPA also made reference to the Article 29 WP's Guidelines on Data Protection Officers, in which it is urged to not designate DPOs already acting as defense counsel for the same court.  In the case at hand, it resulted that the DPO shared with the Municipality an interest in obtaining a rejection of the appeal. Consequently, the Italian Garante held this to be in violation of art. 38(6) GDPR, as well the fact that it undermined the DPO's independence.

The Italian DPA held a cumulative breach of art. 5(1)(a) and (e) and (2) (in conjunction with article 24), 12, 13 and 38(6) GDPR. It balanced the fact that the personal data processing affected all other citizens, who passed through the areas under surveillance, against the lack of previous violations committed by the data controller.

* Change the data processing agreement with Google so that the DPA's remarks in their 14 July and 18 August decisions to Helsingor municipality, are implemented. This includes, at a minimum, a clarification of where and if Google acts as a sole controller and any uncertainties that may entail that Google acts beyond their role as a processor, see Article 28(3)(a) GDPR.
* Document that all transfers of personal data to insecure third countries, are in line with the GDPR.
* Describe all data flows and identify the personal data that are shared with the vendor, and clarify when the vendor acts as a sole or joint controller. This documentation must include the whole technology stack used by the municipality (for this processing activity).
* Update their data protection impact assessment based on all identified risks.
* Consult the DPA if the DPIA shows any high risks the municipality is not able to mitigate.

"Following informations received from the Internet, the Romanian DPA launched an ex officio investigation into Realmedia Network SA (the controller) for a possible data breach. The controller operates a real estate platform called imobiliare.ro, where agencies and individuals can advertise their properties.

The DPA's investigation revealed the unauthorized disclosure and access to the following personal data that was not supposed to be accessible: name, surname, telephone number, email address, postal address, personal numerical code, signature, copies of identity cards, including identification codes, function/quality, bank data, information included in land deed extracts/cadastral drafts, property titles and user profile image. 194,309 data subjects were impacted.","The DPA held that the controller violated Articles 32(1)(b) and 32(2) GDPR for not implementing adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a security level according to the processing risk.

Consequently, the DPA fined the €8,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"The DPA received 17 notifications of data breaches regarding Raiffeisen Bank SA (the controller). The notifications were (for the most part) done by the controller itself and affected its customers (the data subjects). Therefore, the DPA started an investigation into the controller. During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller used the systems managed by the Credit Bureau S.A., the National Tax Administration Agency (ANAF) and its own IT systems to simulate credit decisions (""pre-scoring"") for an external credit broker.

Two notifications were about pre-scoring operations carried out for (potential) customers, concerning at least 169 data subjects. The DPA found that the controller used the Credit Bureau System without the necessary signature from the data subjects to access their data in the respective system.

The controller further notified the DPA about a data breach that resulted in the context of loans to individual data subjects with the help of an external company, acting as a processor. Apparently, some data subjects were approved for loans without them having requested them and without having signed any relevant documents regarding these loans.

In addition, four data breaches happened in the context of email communications. The cause for every one of these data breaches was that the controller entered a wrong e-mail address. In one case, as a result of two data subjects submitting similar complaints, the controller sent documents containing personal data belonging to one data subject to the other.

Another incident concerned a situation involving suspected internal credit fraud. To investigate the suspected fraud, the controller carried out specific operations to grant a loan to a data subject without the presence of the data subject. The controller applied for credit facilities, completed and signed the documentation related to the credit facility. To update the data subjects' data in its application, the controller changed the data subjects' phone number with a phone number of one of its employees and entered a fictitious email address. A similar data breach took place when the controller granted three credit facilities (Flexicredit, Flexicredit refinancing and Purchasing Card) in the name of a data subject without the latter having actually requested these.

Last, a data breach consisted of the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of some data subjects from their Smart Mobile account (the mobile banking service provided by the controller) to other customers of the controller.","The DPA held that the controller did not take measures to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority and having access to personal data did not process them unless requested to do so by the controller. The DPA stated that this led to unauthorised access to the personal data of the controller's customers (e.g. name, surname, home address, nationality, image of the person, personal number code, identity card number and serial number, email, phone number, data from the Credit Bureau System, data from the record system managed by ANAF, data from the Smart Mobile account) and unauthorised disclosure of this data by the controller.

The DPA underlined that, according to the principle of integrity and confidentiality laid down in Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, the controller had the obligation to process personal data in a way that ensured their adequate security. This included protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or accidental damage, by taking appropriate technical or organisational measures.

The DPA sanctioned the controller with two warnings and three fines, totalling to €28,000. This included one fine amounting to €3,000, one amounting to €20,000, and two warnings for violating Article 32(4) jo Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR (security of processing). In addition, a fine of €5,000 for violating Article 25(1) GDPR (data protection by design and default).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32"
"KMD A/S (processor) is a Danish IT service provider offering digital solutions for various industries, including the public sector. Between 19 and 21 January 2021, several municipalities complained to the DPA about a data breach caused by the KMD, which the DPA decided to investigate.

The breach involved the AULA platform used to process children's information from schools and daycares and controlled by another processor, namely KOMBIT A/S. As a result of an update run by KMD in its systems, the information about foster parents was sent to AULA, giving them access to foster children's information which they were not supposed to have. However, the KMD denied its responsibility during the breach investigation, suggesting that it could not test how the update worked with the recipient's system AULA.","The DPA held that when developing new functionality for an IT system, the processor must consider the potential consequences of an update and conduct appropriate tests. That way, the processor must ensure that the changes do not compromise the existing security requirements.

Additionally, the processor must create an overview of its own IT architecture and environment, including the systems integrated with other systems by delivering or receiving data, and ensure mapping of the integrations and associated dependencies. As a result, the processor must report code changes in integrated systems to relevant controllers and processors before they go into production. These requirements must ensure that external controllers and processors are informed of the planned changes on time and can carry out appropriate tests of the integrity of personal data exchanged between the integrated systems.

Consequently, the DPA considered that KMD had a duty and a possibility to test the interaction of its new functionality with AULA and therefore violated Article 32(1) GDPR by not doing so.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"The data subject had dealt with a medical laboratory (the controller) on several occasions. He underwent a medical analysis multiple times.  After hearing that his doctor had remote access to the results, the data subject found out that the website of the laboratory contained a link to a page for access to medical data under the name ‘Cyberplab’, which used an unsafe http-protocol.

The data subject filed a complaint at the Belgian DPA against the controller. After receiving the complaint, the DPA initiated an investigation into the matter.  The site was unencrypted with the http-protocol at the time of the first report of the investigation of the DPA. However, after the DPA had made contact with the controller, the controller added TLS 1.2 to the website, a basic protocol which is used for websites since 1999. Because of this, the site used the  https-protocol.

The controller challenged most findings of the investigation. The controller stated that it thought that it was the processor instead of the controller. The controller also stated that her processing operation was small before the pandemic but had since then grown into a large processing operation. Before the pandemic, it claimed to have 50 operations a day, but didn’t provide any statistics how much operations were undertaken each day during – and after the pandemic. The controller also stated that the GDPR doesn’t contain any provision that this information should be provided on a website at all. The controller also stated that, given the small number of processing before the COVID crisis, a posting of the information in its physical sites was sufficient during that time.","Firstly, the Belgian DPA held that the laboratory was a controller pursuant to Article 4(7) GDPR because it determined both the purposes and means of processing.

Secondly, the DPA also held that the controller had inadequately secured the health data in its possession. More precisely, the DPA held that the controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and 32 GDPR). In particular, the controller had not implemented secure and encrypted login and communication protocols which, in turn, made it possible for an attacker to perform ‘man in the middle attacks’. For the same reasons, the DPA also held that the processor did not take appropriate technical and organizational measures under Article 24 GDPR and 25 GDPR. However, the DPA considered that in this case, the violations of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and 32 GDPR were sufficient in order to sanction the website's lack of security.

Furthermore, the DPA held that the controller violated Articles 35(1) and 35(3) by not conducting a data protection impact assessment. In determining whether the controller was obliged to do so, the DPA considered that the central issue was whether the processing at hand was large scale or not. The DPA considered the number of data subject, the volume of data, the length in time of processing operation and the geographical scale of the processing to be the relevant factors for this question. Since an external service provider stated in its report that the processing in question was large scale and concerned special categories of data, the DPA held that the controller should have conducted a data protection impact assessment before the processing had started.

Finally, the DPA held that the controller had also violated Articles 12, 13, and 14 GDPR, mainly due to a lack of a privacy policy on its website until the DPA contacted the controller. The DPA held that providing this information at the physical test sites was insufficient. Moreover, the DPA found no evidence that the controller had provided any GDPR-information at the physical locations. It is clear from the decision that the DPA held that the information should also be available on a website, despite any availability at physical locations.

After taking into account several aggravating and mitigating factors, the DPA fined the controller €20,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32, Article 35"
"GIE INFOGREFFE (controller) has a website which allows consultation of legal information on companies. This website also provides the possibility to order certain documents. In its ""Confidentiality Charter"" on its website, the controller made a distinction between two kinds of users: ""members"" and ""subscribers"". ""Members"" were users who could order a selected paid service on the website, for which they needed an account. ""Subscribers"" were users who had subscribed to an annual subscription of the website.

A data subject filed a complaint at the DPA stating that he was able to get a password on the phone only by telling his name. The data subject also complained that the website stored user passwords in plain text. The DPA started an investigation into the website of the controller.

On its website, the controller had stated in the ""Confidentiality Charter"" that the personal data of members and subscribers were kept for 36 months after the last order from a customer requesting service or documents. The DPA found in its investigation that no procedure for the automatic deletion of personal data was used by the controller and that personal data was kept for excessive periods of time in relation to the respective purpose and the own policy set by the controller. The controller admitted that personal data had been kept for longer than 36 months but stated that for purposes such as 'collection operations', it would be justified for certain data to be stored for a longer period of time.

With regard to the manual anonymization of personal data upon requests of users, the controller admitted that 25% of accounts were kept for more than 36 months after the last order, formality or invoice, without being anonymized. The was also no automatic anonymization procedure implemented by the controller.","The DPA held that the controller violated Article 5(1)(e) GDPR because personal data was kept for more than 36 months.

First, the DPA held that purpose and the deletion period stated by the controller could only concern the personal data of ""subscribers"" and not of ""members"", because ""members"" were paying immediately for a service or document. The DPA also held that some purposes were not identified by the controller, such as the purpose to provide a document for ""members"", accounting purposes and tax purposes.

The DPA held the retention of data could appear justified for the purposes of providing documents, accounting and tax purposes. However, according to the DPA, when relevant personal data had to be retained longer than the retention period, some extra measures needed to be implemented. The data had to be stored in a temporary separate storage location, for example in a dedicated archive database or in a separate part of an existing database. This data shouldn't be kept for a longer period then what's necessary for the respective purposes of the controller. The DPA also held that only authorized people should have access to this data. None of these described measures were implemented by the controller in this case.

The DPA also found that the manual anonymization procedure at the request of users concerned a small number of accounts. Anonymization was not implemented for 25% of accounts where this should have been the case. The DPA also held that no automatic anonymization procedure was implemented by the controller. Therefore, the controller was able to keep identifying data without any time limit. Because of these facts, the DPA held that Article 5(1)(e) GDPR had been breached, despite the fact that the controller had deleted inactive user-accounts during the procedure.

The DPA also held that article 32 GDPR was violated because of several security problems. The DPA discovered that the controller stored passwords in plain text in a database. Furthermore, users were not allowed to create a password of more than 8 characters, without any complexity requirements and other security measures. Passwords were also transmitted in plain text during email conversations with users. Finally, users were not warned when their password was being changed, thus not ensuring a safe level security protecting against identity theft.

Considering the high number of users (3.7 million) and the sensitivity of the data concerned (bank related, name, address, phone numbers etc.) the CNIL considered the infringement as 'serious' and enforced a €250,000 fine.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"The Greek DPA initiated an investigation regarding the processing of health data in accordance with its ex officio competences under Articles 51 and 55 GDPR and Article 9 of National Law 4624/2019. The DPA examined the legal compliance of the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Labor and of Social Affairs, the Naval Defense Fund, the Ministry of Health and IDIKA S.A. (the controllers) with regards to the processing of personal data on the COVID-19 self-test distribution platform.","The Greek DPA started by pointing out that certain restrictive measures, such as the obligation to use self-testing to control the spread of a virus, are justified by objectives of public interest, specifically the need to protect public health and, therefore, are permissible under Article 8(2) ECHR as well as Articles 9 and 25 of the Greek Constitution.

Further, the DPA examined whether the controllers possessed a valid legal basis for their processing activities, including the processing of special categories of personal data. In the present case, processing took place under Articles 6(1)(c) and (e) GDPR as well as Articles 9(2)(g) and (i) GDPR for sensitive data.

The DPA also assessed the compliance with transparency obligations under Articles 5(1) and 13 GDPR. It concluded that the information provided by the Ministry of the Interior regarding data retention periods was incomplete and opaque thereby violating Article 13(2) GDPR. The investigated controllers did not comply with the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1) GDPR because the data retention period was not specified in relation to the purpose for which the personal data was collected. For IDIKA S.A., the violation of this principle happened because the controller did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures as provided in Article 25(1) GDPR. Specifically, the controller did not undertake a risk analysis and assessment with regards to the storage period of students’ personal data on the self-test platform. Moreover, the controller did not provide documentation about the operation of a special application for the declaration of the self-test results for ship crew members. As a consequence, the DPA imposed a €5,000 fine on IDIKA S.A..

Additionally, the Greek DPA concluded that IDIKA S.A. and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs only prepared a data protection impact assessment after the start of processing against the provision of Article 35(1) GDPR. Despite a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individual persons, including extensive processing of sensitive data, the Ministry of the Interior and the Naval Defense Fund did not carry out a data protection impact assessment at all.

"A bank (the controller) organized prize games for its clients. Considering that it had a large number of clients who lived in urban areas where it is not uncommon for different people to have the same first and last name and at the same time have the same address, the controller considered it necessary to undoubtedly establish the identity of the participants. Thus, it collected and processed the winners' data, and published it on the website.

The Croatian DPA launched an investigation after it found out that the controller published the personal identification numbers (OIB) and residence addresses of the winners of the prize game on its website. Acting ex officio, the Croatian DPA requested a statement from the controller on the legal basis for such publication. The DPA also inquired on the method of informing the participants on the processing of their personal data under Article 13 GDPR.

In response, the bank argued that in order to participate in the prize draw, it was necessary to enter the name, surname, OIB, phone number or e-mail address. The above data was requested for identification purposes and thus was fulfilling the obligation of the bank to conduct the prize game in accordance with the Ordinance on the organization of prize games, which also includes notifying the winner about the award.","The Croatian DPA established that, in this case, the conditions for fair and lawful processing of personal data from Articles 5 and 6 GDPR were not met. The controller did not prove the existence of a legal basis for the publication of personal data consisting of the OIB and residence addresses of the winners of a particular prize game.

Over the course of 2020 and 2021, the Judicial Police and the Spanish DPA received numerous complaints by employees of the restaurant, the data subjects, related to the discovery of hidden and operational audio and video recording systems in the company's toilet as well as changing and locker rooms. In the following investigation, the public entities were able to collect evidence of the hidden devices.

Following further investigations, the DPA considers it undisputed at the time of the proceedings at hand that the data controller engaged in video and audio surveillance of its employees and costumers since 2018.

While the controller informed its employees that their images, captured by video cameras, could be used to comply with labour laws, neither the employees nor the controller's costumers were informed of the hidden audio recordings.","The DPA held that the conduct of the controller infringed the GDPR by establishing three conclusions.

First, the recording of images and sounds of employees and costumers constituted the processing of personal data pursuant to  Article 4(1) and Article 4(2) GDPR.

Second, the data controller's hidden image and sound recording of the employees' private spaces violated the principle of data minimisation pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and the limits of proportionality and minimum intervention according to Article 89 of the national LOPDGDD law.

Third, the Spanish DPA held that the controller failed to consider the decision of the Spanish Constitutional Court Rec. No. 4015/1996, according to which the recording of conversations among workers or between workers and customers is not justified to ensure the employers compliance with their obligations and duties.

Therefore, the DPA concluded that the hidden image and voice recordings of uninformed employees and customers had no legal basis pursuent to Article 6 GDPR.

In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA considered aggravating factors, as stipulated in Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, and mitigating factors, as established by Article 83(2)(k) GDPR. The aggravating factors consisted of the duration of the infringement and the significant number of personal data subjects affected by the violation, whereas the DPA acknowledged as mitigating factors  the data controler's status as a small business (SME) and its low turnover.

The inspection covered 37 personal data security breaches from 27 May 2021 to 16 August 2022, where the controller accidentally shared protected information about one party to a proceeding with another party. In those cases, parties protected their contact details precisely to avoid the other party getting to know their whereabouts, e.g. due to concerns about child abduction, violence, etc.

The disclosures happened mainly because of a human error when responding to information access requests, information letters, party hearings and sending decisions. Case handlers would not pay enough attention to the information and thereby did not anonymise it. The controller emphasised that it processes thousands of cases each year. Despite the strong focus on avoiding accidental disclosure of personal data and continuous work to improve data security, human errors can occur when employees perform their job. These errors can, unfortunately, lead to breaches of personal data security.","The DPA held that the requirement of Article 32 GDPR for adequate security typically obliges the controller to ensure that information about data subjects, including particularly confidential and sensitive information, is not disclosed to unauthorised persons. To avoid this, the controller must conduct appropriate content quality control in forwarded documents. Furthermore, handling confidential and sensitive personal data places greater demands on employees' diligence in connection with the transmission of personal data, including ensuring that they send the correct information to the right recipient.

The DPA also acknowledged that the controller significantly improved their data security after the decision of 4 March 2021. However, the DPA held that the controller should have reviewed their previous risk assessment in light of the new and repeated breaches, and they should have introduced additional control measures. Examples of such measures include data minimisation, where the address is only used when required for the decision or for sending by physical post. The controller could also block the electronic document and case management system (ESDH) from sending information about addresses to unauthorised persons. Alternatively, they could introduce an actual Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system.

Consequently, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 32(1) GDPR when they ascertained and reported new personal data security breaches but did not reconsider the existing security measures to prevent future disclosures of the same type.

The DPA held that the DPA in the UK should be regarded as the lead supervisory authority in this case of cross-border processing (Article 4(23) GDPR). There was no agreement between the joint controllers (Article 26 GDPR). Therefore, the DPA considered several factors to decide why the company in the UK should be regarded as the principal place of business for the purposes of data processing decisions and their application. One factor was the fact that in each of the privacy policies of the controller's companies across EU-member states, it was explicitly mentioned that the controller is the company incorporated under English law (UK). It also mentions that the other companies, such as the Belgian one, are joint Controllers. Another factor was that the communication with the data subject was taken over by the privacy team in the United Kingdom from the customer service in Belgium. The controller also produced internal documents which explain the procedure for exercising rights with a system of 'escalation' to the Privacy team in the UK, for example form the customer service in Belgium to the privacy team in the United Kingdom. The controller further specified that the procedure for this decision was also prepared by the parent company in the United Kingdom.

Another factor which the DPA considered was the fact that the Italian DPA had also received a complaint against the controller and had considered the DPA in the UK to be the lead supervisory authority. This consideration was accepted by the DPA in the UK.

The DPA held that it is competent to deal with this decision, because the controller didn’t establish a new principal place of business in an EU member state after Brexit. As a result, the Belgium DPA was therefore competent to deal with the complaint since a complaint was filed at the Belgian DPA.

The DPA held that it was not necessary to specify the relationship between the joint controllers in the UK and in Belgium.

Belgian DPA decided to close the case

The DPA decided to close the case because of several reasons. The findings of investigations unit were made at a time when the jurisdiction of the Belgian DPA was not established in UK Law. The DPA therefore held that it couldn't rely on these findings. It also held that the violations of the controller were the result of human error. It also held that GDPR was taken into account with the handling of the complaint. It further considered the concrete circumstances of the case, such as the time elapsed, the subject matter and the absence of high impact for the data subject.

Nonetheless, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 15(1) GDPR (confirmation of the processing of data and information) and Article 15(3) GDPR (copy of the data). The Controller also violated Article 12(3) GDPR (the response to a request to exercise a right must be made, with certain exceptions, within one month). All these violations were found because the controller had failed to provide access to the requested data.

The DPA didn’t sanction the controller but informed the controller how it could comply better with the GDPR in the future by referring to EDPB guidelines 01/2022 regarding the right of access.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 12, Article 15, Article 26, Article 56"
"In the first place, the data subject submitted a claim against their former employer company (the controller) for an illegal communication of their previous trade union membership data. Specifically, the controller sent to the CGT Union a registered mail explaining that the data subject had been a worker representative in another Union (Sindicato Unitario de Huelva) and that could lead to an incompatibility with their current nomination in CGT Union.

Additionally, the data subject claimed that their union membership and other data were also shared to the media since there were some news about their dismissal. In this regard, the data subject presented a letter sent by the controller stating that “[Data subject’s] disciplinary dismissal was prior to their nomination by CGT Union as company’s union section secretary, since the data subject was a member of Sindicato Unitario de Huelva when dismissed”.

Furthermore, it was published in another medium that the data subject was dismissed on disciplinary grounds.

Considering the above, the Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding and notified the controller, who claimed that the communication of the union membership data was carried out in a common context of legal cooperation between the controller and the workers who make use of their right to freedom of union. The mention of the data subject in this interaction was allegedly due to their relation with both unions and the company, and that information shared had direct effect to the right to freedom of union.","First, the DPA agreed that data relating to trade union membership constitutes sensitive data within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR. The DPA alluded to Article 9(1) GDPR which prohibits the processing of these special categories of personal data. On the other hand, Article 9(2) GDPR contains a list of exceptions for this prohibition. One of them allows for the processing of sensitive data in order to assess the working capacity of the employees. Additionally, Article 9(3) GDPR states that the processing shall be allowed when performed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy.

The DPA also noted that Article 6 GDPR contains the legal bases for lawful processing. Therefore, these two Articles establish the circumstances for the legal processing of the general and special categories of data, respectively.

Finally, the DPA referred to Article 29 Working Party on its “Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-making and Profiling for the Purpose of Regulation 2016/679” stating that data controllers can only process sensitive data if one of the conditions of Article 9(2) is fulfilled, in addition to any one of the conditions of Article 6 GDPR.

In this case, the controller claimed to have a legitimate interest for the processing of the data, therefore it did not ask for the data subject's consent. However, legitimate interest, even if the controller had one, cannot be a legal basis for the processing of sensitive data.

Taking this into account, the DPA conclued that the controller had no valid legal basis for the processing of trade union membership data. It fined the controller twice €40,000 for infringing Articles 6 and 9 GDPR, respectively. This was reduced to a total of €64,000 due to voluntary payment.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 83"
"The controller is a catalogue retailer that sells health related services and products. The DPA started to investigate the controller after it came across it during another investigation.

In its investigation into the controller, the DPA found that between August 2019 and 19 August 2020, when a customer purchased a ""trigger product"" from the controller, it would make assumptions about customers' medical conditions and then market health-related products to them without their consent. the controller linked the trigger products to several health conditions which Easylife inferred that the customer was likely to have. After this, the controller would trigger marketing calls through a third party telemarketing provider based on the transaction data. Overall, the incident affected 145,400 data subjects. Their personal data would include their names, telephone numbers, and special categories of data.

For the processing, the controller relied on its own legitimate interests for the processing, such as 'to store the information' and 'to maintain it as evidence'. Data subjects were not involved that their personal data would be used for profiling.

The DPA became concerned that using transaction data to make inferences about health conditions could constitute profiling, and the inferences made about health conditions could indicate processing of special category data.

In the representations, the controller argued that it had acquired the requisite consent to process special category data because it had notified customers that it would be using their personal data to notify them of products ""that might be of interest'.","The DPA held that the transactional purchase data of Easylife's customers was personal data.

The DPA held that when the controller used relevant transactional data to select customers for telemarketing, this constituted profiling. When controller used the transactional data to decide which products to market to which customers, based on its inferences of customer's health conditions, this constituted the processing of special category data. This was irrespective of the controllers level of statistical confidence over the profiling.

The DPA held that Easylife breached Article 13 GDPR because the data subjects were not informed that their information would be used for profiling. The controller also violated Article 9 GDPR, because it did not collect customer's explicit consent to process special category data as required by Article 9 GDPR. Instead, the controller relied on legitimate interest. As a result, it also breached Article 6 GDPR besides Article 9 GDPR for not having lawful basis to process special category data. Since the individuals were not informed about profiling of special category data, the DPA held that controller also conducted ""invisible"" processing of special category data. Therefore, the controller didn't process the data fairly, lawfully or transparently pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

The DPA also dismissed the argument of the controller that it had acquired consent because it had notified them that it would use personal data to notify them of products that might be of interest to them. The DPA held that no customer would have understood this that the controller was going to use their special category data in a direct marketing telephone campaign.

The DPA imposed a fine of £1,350,000 on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13"
"The complainant  requested erasure under Article 17 GDPR. It took two months before they received a reply from the controller. After two months, the data subject received a reply which stated that her request will be handled but that her request for erasure may take another 90 days to be completed. The complainant considered it unreasonable that it takes a total of five months for the controller to handle her request.

The controller stated that the initial delays were due to issues on its side in verifying the data subject's identity. The erasure was delayed due to lower staffing during the Christmas and New Year holidays. The controller holds that it has handled the complainants request without undue delay considering the Christmas and New Year holidays and the individual error concerning the confirmation.","The DPA pointed out that Article 12(3) GDPR requires the controller to provide the data subject, upon request, without undue delay and in any event no later than one month after receiving the request, with information on the actions taken pursuant to Article 17 GDPR. Moreover, the one-month time limit may be extended by a further two months where the request is particularly complex or the number of requests received is high. In this case, the controller shall inform the data subject of the extension and indicate the reasons for the delay.

The investigation found that the controller did not inform the data subject until approximately two months after the request was received and the identity of the complainant was verified, that the erasure process was initiated and that it can take up to 90 days for the erasure to be completed nor did the controller state the reasons for the delay.

Consequently, the DPA held that controller did not dealt with the complainant’s request without undue delay within the meaning of Article 12(3) GDPR. In light of the this, the DPA concluded that the controller has processed the complainant’s personal data in violation of Article 12(3) GDPR. Since the violation occurred due to human error and only affected one person, the DPA limited its corrective measures to giving a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 17, Article 58"
"The controller was a photographer who offered photoshoots in the area of youth sports. In 2018, he provided preview pictures taken as the official photographer at an international water diving competition in Croatia on their website.  A total of 16,392 pictures of the participating children and adolescents (data subjects), aged 6-18, were offered for sale on the website between 12 July 2018 and 7 September 2021. The photos could be categorised on the controller's website specific to each subcategories of the participants ""Boy A"" ""Girl B"" etc. The photos could be bought individually by any person without registration either for private or editorial use, as a digital download, CD or on a USB stick. The data subjects depicted in the photos and their legal guardians had not consented to the publication and sale of the photos by the controller.

A complaint was filed pursuant of Article 77 GDPR. In the following Article 60 GDPR procedure, the Berlin DPA was the lead supervisory authority (LSA) with the Croatian DPA as a CSA.","The Berlin DPA held that the controller's conduct infringed Article 6(1) GDPR in conjunction with Article 83(5)(a) GDPR for the following reasons.

Article 6(1) GDPR provides that the processing of personal data is only permitted if one of the conditions under Art. 6(1)(a) to Art. 6(1)(a)(f) GDPR is met. The DPA considered the publication of photos of children and adolescents, without their consent or their legal guardian's consent, infringed Article 6(1) GDPR.

The DPA considered whether Article 85(2) GDPR and German national law Sections 22, 23 KUG (Act on Copyright in Works of Fine Arts and Photography) and Section 19(1) of the Berlin Data Protection Act (BlnDSG) provided derogations or exemptions from Article 6 GDPR, for processing operations carried out for journalistic purposes where this was necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression in journalism. The DPA cited the ECJ in Sergejs Buivids/Datu valsts inspekcija: It cannot be assumed that any information published on the internet which relates to personal data falls within the notion of journalistic purposes. Publications in the online world can only be classified as journalism if they have a minimum journalistic-editorial content. A sufficiently journalistic-editorial level exists if 'the opinion­ forming effect for the general public is a defining component of the offer' and not merely an 'ornamental accessory'.

Accordingly, the DPA found that the publication of the photos could not be classified as data processing for journalistic purposes because the photos had not been edited. There was also no restriction on their further use for journalistic purposes. The fact that some of these Children were athletes who were covered in the press before was of no consequence to the DPA. The controller did not deal with the content of the photos but merely offered the photos for sale with the clear focus on commercial exploitation. Hence, the journalism exemption under Sections 22, 23 KUG and Section 19 (1) of the Berlin Data Protection Act (BlnDSG) did not apply to this case, and the controller still needed to have a legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR for his processing activities.

The DPA also found that there was no legally valid consent of the children and adolescents for the publication of the photos according to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR, as the controller did not provide the DPA with any documented consent. The controller argued that he had obtained verbal consent from the participants and it was common for participants to give consent when they registered for the event. This argument was rejected by the DPA as the present case was about publication of photos for sales purpose, not about the taking of photos. Publication required verifiable consent, and it was the controller's obligation to document such consent.

The DPA also rejected the application of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as there was no contract between the photographer and the data subjects or their legal guardians for taking photos of data subjects. There was only a contract between the photographer and the organiser of the event.

The DPA also held could not rely on legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). The DPA assumed the controller had legitimate interest due to the official invitation to the event and the organizer's interest to document this event, but it must be balanced against the data subject's fundamental rights. The DPA referred to recital 47 GDPR, which assumes that children under the age of 16 are in greater need of protection, and their interests therefore generally outweigh Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. In the present case, the publication of the photos affected the data subjects' right to respect for private and family life under Article 7 CFR and their right to protection of personal data under Article 8 CFR, whilst the publication of photos primarily served commercial purpose and the photos were easily accessible worldwide without further protection. Accordingly, the data subject's interests to be published online outweighed the controller's legitimate interest in the sales of photos.

Since no (other) legal basis could be established under Article 6(1) GDPR, the DPA imposed a fine of 1000 EUR for the unlawful processing on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6
"The data subject submitted a claim against an insurance company (the controller) for allowing changes to their health insurance policy. The insurance policy was initially signed in 2016 and linked to the data subject as policyholder as well as the owner of the bank account from which the insurance premiums were paid. However, the insured person was their former partner.

In June 2021, the data subject’s former partner submitted a request to change the health insurance policy data, which was done by the bank (the processor). The data changed were the policyholder name and the bank account to which the insurance premiums were associated, allowing the data subject’s former partner to pay the insurance fees themselves. These changes were made without the consent of the data subject.

After a first complaint by the data subject to the processor, the data subject was included as the insurance holder again. After a further complaint, their bank account number was restored.

In August 2022, the Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the controller, which allowed to hear the claims from the involved parties. Both the controller and the processor claimed to have obtained implicit consent from the data subject since their initial wish was to cover their partner and that, by losing their status as insurance holder, their obligations were lifted, which was considered a presumed benefit for the data subject.","The DPA started by noting that changes to the insurance policy were not authorised by the data subject and none of the legal basis under Article 6 GDPR could be observed. Meanwhile, the principle of legal processing of data required an accreditation of the consent for the processing as well as a reasonable diligence to prove it. Simply implying that a data subject would consent to a change in the policy cannot in any way be regarded as a valid legal basis. The Spanish DPA found a violation of Article 6(1) GDPR for illegal processing of personal data by the controller.

The DPA decided on appropriate measures against the controller. Based on Article 72(1)(b) of the national data protection law, and Articles 83(1)  and 83(2) GDPR, the DPA considered aggravating circumstances. Firstly, there was a lack of legal basis for the processing affecting the fundamental right to data protection. Secondly, the controller was one of the main insurance companies in the country whose activity was directly linked to the processing of personal data from clients and from third parties. Finally, the controller showed grievous lack of due care and diligence. The two latter factors were associated with the Supreme Court’s case law regarding the higher due care attributed to companies whose activity involves abundant processing of personal data.

Therefore, the Spanish DPA proposed a fine of €40,000 which was reduced to €24,000 with the application of two reductions: the acceptance of guilt, and the voluntary payment of the fine.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 83"
"The data subject submitted a complaint against a training academy (the controller) for unlawfully publishing their personal data on a website. The publication contained results of a selection process in which the data subject participated. Specifically, the document contained a list with names, last names, anonymised ID numbers and categories assigned to participants. The list allowed the identification of health data relating to disabilities.

In addition, the list corresponded with the provisional publication of results by the Galician Health Services (SERGAS), the authority competent for the examination and selection of candidates. Both lists were different, thus the controller made a re-work of the official list by selecting some candidates, grouping them by categories, breaking down their marks (studies, work experience, other activities) and assigning them a position according to their total score.

The Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the controller due to an alleged violation of Article 6(1) GDPR for the lack of legal basis for processing of personal data, including special categories of personal data. Furthermore, the publication allegedly did not include the mandatory information regarding the origin of the data nor the right to object.

In response, the controller argued that the legal basis was legitimate interest since the academy offered training courses and the publication showed the participants, in a clear way, the position obtained. The controller stated that it was not processing carried out in the context of their usual activity since it was done only once, in relation with that specific selection process. Another argument was that the information had been made public by SERGAS and that candidates who participated in the public selection process expected their data to be published due to transparency obligations.","In the first place, the DPA stated that the publication of data subjects' first and last names on a website was considered processing of personal data. These data allowed the identification of the data subjects since the list contained names of persons who fulfil the requirements to enroll in a specific category, and more elements allowing the identification by a broader audience.

Regarding the claim of the public character of the data, since it had been published on the SERGAS website, the DPA considered that a website is not a publicly accessible source. In addition, in case that the data was made available by a public entity for a specific purpose, the list made by the controller must rely on its own legal basis. When it comes to the concept of publicly accessible sources, the GDPR regulates it in the context of the right to information when the data was not collected from the data subject. In any case, data contained in a publicly accessible source must have a legal basis for further processing.

On the legitimate interest, the DPA noted that Article 29 Working Party Opinion 6/2014states that is necessary to take into account not only the data subject’s fundamental rights and freedoms but also their interests and that “legitimate” involves the need for processing and the use of the least invasive method to achieve the same end. For instance, the controller could have informed only the participants about the results but opted to inform the public in general.

In the context of data impact assessments, the DPA highlighted which elements to include, such as the bargaining position of the parties (especially the controller’s), if there is a reasonable expectation of further processing, the way that the controller processes the data (including if there is profiling or not) and the need for a balancing exercise between the data subject’s rights and interests and the controller’s legitimate interest whose results must show a prevalence of the latter, being the only case to rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

In the present case, the Spanish DPA did not observe a prevalence of the controller’s interest over the data subject’s rights for the following reasons. The processing was not necessary for the initial collection purposes, the data subjects were not informed about the publication of results on the website, sensitive data was included in the list, the storage limitation principle was violated (the publication lasted for more than three months), there was an incomplete impact assessment, there was no inclusion of information regarding the right to object which is mandatory when relying on legitimate interest as legal basis for the processing (Article 21(1) GDPR).

"The controller took over a business unit of Company XX including existing contracts. The data subjects previously consented to the processing of his personal data by company XX.

One data subject stated that he had received electronic payment invoices from the controller, without ever having a contractual relationship with it. It complained about this fact at the controller. After this, the data subject submitted an access request to discover the origin of his personal data and the other information stated in Article 13 GDPR. The data subject didn’t receive an answer within the time limits set in Article 12(3) GDPR. The data subject filed a complaint at the DPA because of this lack of an answer.

However, the controller stated that it deleted the data subject’s personal data after the data subject complained about receiving the electronic payment invoices. The controller stated that it later informed all customers of company XX about the acquisition by the controller. The controller discovered only after the complaint of the data subject at the DPA that his Pec-address (certified e-mail) was missing because of prior deletion.

The controller stated that the obligation to provide information to data subjects did not exist if the purpose of the processing remained unchanged after the acquisition. The controller stated that it had agreed with company XX that the processing would continue on the same terms, in compliance for the purposes for which the data had been collected, using with the same methods. The controller also held that it didn’t need new consent from data subjects for the same reason.","The DPA stated that the controller didn’t provide any proof according to Article 5(2) GDPR regarding the information send to the data subjects about the sale of the company. It was therefore not clear if the controller complied with Article 14 GDPR, since it had collected the personal data from the company XX, and not directly from the data subject.

The DPA held that the controller violated Article 12(3) GDPR because it didn’t provide access within the time limit in this provision. It also violated Article 12(4) GDPR because it failed to inform the data subject about the reasons for non-compliance and the possibility of lodging a complaint with the DPA. The DPA also held a violation of Article 14 GDPR because the controller failed to provide the data subject the necessary information.

The DPA also rejected the argument of the controller in which it argued that the obligation to provide information did not exist if, following a change in the ownership of the processing, the purpose of the processing remains unchanged. The DPA held that this interpretation was in violation with the general principles on the protection of personal data, especially the principles of transparency and fairness (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR).

The DPA also stated that it was necessary for the fairness of processing that parties get information from companies participating in the merger. Data subjects should in particular be informed about the new name of the controller and the identification details of any new data processors.

The DPA held that data subjects in this case were not provided with adequate information, regarding the identity and contact details of the new controller (Article 14(1)(a) GDPR). The data subjects could also not be aware that the companies agreed that the processing would continue on the same terms as before and in accordance with the new controller's terms, for the same purposes for which they had been collected and with the same methods.

The DPA held that that the exception of Article 14(5)(b) GDPR GDPR was not applicable, because the controller was able to communicate with data subjects. Communicating with data subjects was therefore not impossible and wouldn’t involve a disproportionate effort.

The DPA also held that the communication that was send from the controller to the data subjects could not be considered suitable under Article 14 GDPR. The absence of adequate information was the reason the data subject filed an access request in the first place. The DPA also stated the violations were established not only for the data subject, but to all other interested parties whose contracts were transferred between the controller and Company XX.

"The local police of Milan received a complaint about a video surveillance system installed in a building owned by Immobiliare Ricostruzione Meloria s.r.l. (controller). The police investigated the matter and drew up a report. Based on this report, the Italian DPA opened an investigation into the controller.

The controller allegedly installed the system at the request of some tenants of the building. The system consisted of four cameras: one filming the entrance, one the space in front of the lift, and two others facing the backyard, the cellars and a flat. The images taken by the cameras were displayed on a monitor and stored on a recording device, both located in the porter's lodge.

The only information concerning the video surveillance system which passer-bys received consisted of a sign with a figure of a stylised camera placed on the left-hand side of the entrance door to the building. No further information about the processing activity or the data controller was provided, not even on the premises of the porter's lodge.","The DPA held that the use of a video surveillance system may constitute a processing of personal data, depending on the positioning of the cameras and on the quality of the images taken. In the case at hand, this was the case. The DPA noted that any processing of personal data had to be carried out in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 5 GDPR, and in particular, the principle of transparency. The DPA stated that, with regard to the use of video surveillance systems, the principle of transparency could be respected by displaying information signs indicating the data controller and the purpose of the processing, so that data subjects were always aware that they were entering a video surveilled area. However, the mere display of the sign of the stylised camera at the entrance of the building did not sufficiently inform data subjects about the processing nor about their means to exercise their rights as required by Article 13 GDPR. As a result, the processing activity carried out through the use of the video surveillance system violated Article 5(1)(a) and Article 13 GDPR.

Consequently, the DPA ordered the Company to install proper information signs and imposed a fine of €2,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13"
"The controller operates a facial recognition tool (the tool) to identify data subjects using pictures and video's posted online (online content). The controller is established in the United States and has no establishment in the European Union (EU), but processes personal data of EU data subjects. Specifically, it collects online content in which faces appear, including faces of minors.

The tool indexes freely accessible web pages and social media platforms. After the indexing, the tool extracts all images with faces of data subjects. Based on these images, the tool calculates a mathematical hash for each data subject, which is in turn based on a unique biometric template of the face in the picture. The mathematical hash is used to make data subjects searchable in the database.

The controller sells access to its database to third parties. These third parties can upload a picture of a face to start a search in order to identify data subject, after which the tool creates a mathematical hash for this uploaded picture. This new hash is compared with existing hashes in the database. When the hashes are similar, the tool collects all the images with the same hash, including a reference to the original source of each picture. This process makes it possible to identify data subjects.

In its privacy policy, the controller stated that data subjects could only exercise their right of access twice a year. The controller did not mention a retention period for the personal data.

The DPA received several complaints from data subjects regarding the rights of access (Article 15 GDPR) and erasure (Article 17 GDPR) between May and December 2020. One data subject requested a third party to make an access request on her behalf. The controller acknowledged that it had received this request and invited the data subject to use an online platform to exercise her right of access, but failed to answer follow up requests on multiple occasions. When answering to the last request, the controller also asked for the submission of a photograph and ID card and repeated the invitation to use an online platform to exercise the right of access. After 4 months and 7 letters, the controller provided access for this data subject. Another data subject had complained that it had submitted an request for erasure (Article 17 GDPR), but had never received an answer form the controller. The DPA started an investigation following these complaints.

During the investigation, on 26 November 2021, the DPA also ordered the controller to comply with several GDPR Articles. The controller did not provide a response. The investigation was concluded on 14 July 2022, to which the controller did not react either.","GDPR applicable? (Article 3(2) GDPR)

The DPA held that the GDPR was applicable pursuant of Article 3(2) GDPR. Because the controller was not established in the EU, the DPA stated that it was necessary to determine two things: (1) whether the controller processed personal data relating to data subjects in EU territory and (2) if this processing was linked to the monitoring of the behaviour of those individuals (recital 24 and Guidelines 3/2018).

(1) The DPA held that the controller collected three sorts of personal data according to its privacy policy. It determined that the controller collected publicly accessible photographs on the internet, information extracted from these photographs (such as geolocation data) and information from the facial appearance of data subjects in these photographs. The DPA referred to CJEU case law, stating that the image of the individual photographed or filmed constitutes personal data when the individual can be recognised (see CJEU 11 December 2014, Rynes, C-212/13, point 22 and CJEU, 14 February 2019, F.K., C-345/17). The DPA additionally determined that the controller also processed biometric data (Article 4(1)(14) GDRP) and confirmed that the collection of pictures also concerned data subjects in the EU.

(2) Secondly, the DPA held that the processing of the controller was linked to the monitoring of the behaviour of data subjects (Article 3(2)(b) GDPR). The DPA stated that the processing merely had to be ‘related’ to the monitoring. It was not necessary that monitoring of behaviour was the primary purpose of the processing. The DPA stated that monitoring could also include profiling (Article 4(1)(4) GDPR and recital 24). The DPA held that the search result associated with a photograph was a behavioural profile of the data subject because it contained numerous pieces of information about data subjects or allowed access to this information. The DPA stated that the controller created such behavioural profiles using all its collected pictures of data subjects in its database, including links to the original source of the images on the internet. The DPA stated that this made it possible to collect many different bits of information, such as information from a social media account or included metadata from the search. This search also made it possible to identify a data subject’s behaviour on the internet, by analysing what they have decided to put online. The DPA also held that the processing of the controller constituted monitoring on the internet. It stated that the very purpose of the tool was to identify data subjects and collect personal data. It also determined that a third party could search multiple times, which made it possible to detect a change in the data subject's behaviour.

Applicability of one-stop-shop mechanism

The DPA held that the one-stop-shop mechanism was not applicable in this situation of cross border processing and held that every supervisory authority in the EU was competent to deal with this case with regard to processing in its territory. The reason for this was the fact the controller was located in the United States and that there was main or sole establishment of the controller in the EU (Articles 55(1) and 56(1) GDPR and recital 122).

No legal ground for processing (Article 6 GDPR)

The DPA held that the controller violated Article 6 GDPR because it did not have a legal ground for processing (Article 6 GDPR) (recital 47). It stated that the controller processed data solely for commercial purposes, despite the possibility that the service could also be used by law enforcement agencies. The controller’s privacy policy did not mention any legal basis, and the DPA determined that the legal grounds of Article 6(1)(b), 6(1)(c), Article 6(1)(d) and Article 6(1)(e) GDPR were not applicable in this case. It also held that the controller could not rely on legitimate interests ((Article 6(1)(f) GDPR and (recital 47)), even if the controller had economic interests. The DPA ruled the balancing exercise of the controller’s interests on the one hand, against the interests of the data subjects on the other hand, in favour of the latter. It considered amongst other things that the processing was particularly intrusive.

Violation of the right of access (Article 15 GDPR)

The DPA held that the controller violated Articles 12 and 15 GDPR. It stated that the answer of the controller was only partial, because all the information mentioned in Article 15(1) GDPR was missing from the response. In its response, the controller only referred to its privacy policy. It also only contained results of a search in its database. The DPA determined that the limitation on the right of access for data subjects (twice every year) had no basis at all, because the privacy policy did not specify the retention period of the personal data.

Violation of the right of erasure (Article 17 GDPR)

The DPA held that the controller violated Article 17 GDPR because the controller did not reply to an erasure request by a data subject. The DPA determined that erasure was legally binding because there was no legal basis for the processing.

Violation for lack of cooperation with the DPA (Article 31 GDPR)

The DPA held that the controller violated Article 31 GDPR because it did only partially answer an information request and neglected an order by the DPA to comply with the GDPR.

The DPA fined the controller the amount of €20,000,000 under Article 83 GPDR and considered several aggravating factors, such as the severity of the violation of Article 6 GDPR and the fact that the biometric template of faces in pictures was considered sensitive personal data (Article 9 GDPR).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17, Article 32, Article 9"
"SmartResponse A/S (the controller) offers online marketing solutions for advertisers. It, among others, processes personal data of participants in Internet competitions. In order to sign up for an Internet competition, participants have to give consent for the controller to process information about them and to pass it on to the controller's business partners. In the present case, the collected data included e-mail addresses, gender, IP addresses, date of birth, telephone numbers and postal addresses of the participants.

Following an inquiry from the Consumer Ombudsman and a number of complaints from concerned data subjects, the Danish DPA initiated an investigation into the controller's processing of personal data. The procedure concerned i.a. the disclosure of personal data in connection with the offering of Internet competitions and questionnaires used in that context. In April 2020, the DPA sent a request to the controller asking to provide information on its processing activities, followed by several requests for additional clarification. Based on this, the DPA assessed the legal basis for processing, the retention periods and the information provided to data subjects on processing.","First, the DPA noted that the controller processed data of participants in online competitions based on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The processing was carried out for the purpose of direct marketing, as data subjects registered in the competition also consented to receive direct marketing from the controller and 45 business partners. The DPA acknowledged that the controller included a possibility to unsubscribe and withdraw consent by sending an email to the controller or contacting individuals advertisers. The DPA analysed the conditions for consent in Article 7 GDPR as well as the EDPB Guidelines 05/2020. It concluded that the conditions were met and the controller had a valid legal basis for conducting the competition and related direct marketing.

However, the DPA also investigated the legal basis for data processed in relation to a questionnaire offered to the participants with a view to adapting marketing to the individual's personal needs. In this regard, it held that the controller could not use Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis. There was no proper balancing of interests at stake and the information asked in the questionnaire was too detailed to be passed on to business partners for the purpose of direct marketing under a legitimate interest legal basis. Nevertheless, since the controller ceased processing the questionnaires in November 2021, the DPA did not take further action in this regard.

In relation to the principles in Article 5 GDPR, the DPA noted that once consent was withdrawn, the participant's phone number and email address were registered on a ""no-thanks"" list, under the legal basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, in order to prevent further direct marketing. Personal data processed on the basis of consent must then be deleted after consent is revoked unless there is another legal basis for the processing. The DPA considered this processing to be unnecessary and against the data minimisation principle. Moreover, this information was stored for 5 years, thereby violating the storage limitation principle of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. Lastly, the DPA held that data subjects did not receive sufficient information about the inclusion on the 'no-thanks' list after consent had been withdrawn. The data subjects also did not have enough information to exercise their rights under Article 21 GDPR in order to stop direct marketing. Hence, the DPA found a violation of Articles 12(1) and 13(1)(d) GDPR.

By using its powers under Article 58(2) GDPR, the DPA reprimanded the controller for violations of Articles 5(1)(e), 6(1)(f), 12(1) and 13(1)(d) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 58"
"Tet (the controller) is an internet service provider which also offers additional services in the telecommunications and entertainment sectors. The Latvian DPA started an ex officio investigation into the controller's data processing practices. Specifically, it looked into the transfers of customers' (data subjects) data to out-of-court debt recovery service providers. The controller claimed that these transfers were carried out for the purpose of, among others, checking the solvency of data subjects when preparing a contract.

In the course of the investigation, the DPA found that the solvency checks with a debt recovery service happened without prior identity checks of the data subjects. In one case, because the controller had not verified the accuracy of the information provided by a customer, personal data of a minor was transferred to the debt recovery service.

On 15 July 2022, the DPA issued the original decision imposing the fine. On 2 August 2022, it received the controller's request for an oral hearing to express that the fine, among others, was disproportionate and not accurate, in addition to the proceedings before the DPA exceeding the time limits and allegedly not allowing the controller to exercise its rights.","Although the decision focuses mainly on re-assessing the final amount of the administrative fine, the DPA briefly recalled the material violations. The Latvian DPA noted that the controller had made a mistake in not ensuring the accuracy of personal data before sending it to debt recovery services for the purpose of assessing the data subject's solvency prior to formation of a service contract. The service was provided and connected without an identity check nor the data subject's confirmation of the contract. This resulted in the personal data of a minor being transferred to a debt recovery service. The DPA found that the transfer of unverified personal data violated Article 5(1)(a) and (d) GDPR.

Additionally, by posting documents containing unverified and innacurate personal data in the controller's internal customer self-service system under the respective user account, the controller disclosed the personal data of the data subject (name, surname, date of birth and home address) to third parties. This violated Article 5(1)(a) and (f) GDPR.

The controller also compared the personal data of old (including former customers) and new customers available in its database in violation of Article 5(1)(a), (b), (d) and (e) GDPR. Furthermore, there was no legal basis for these processing operations under Article 6(1) GDPR.

The DPA took into account the objections raised by the controller during the oral hearing. Regarding the argument that the administrative violation process had been disproportionately long, the DPA stated that although the investigation and review procedure, indeed, extended the statutory time limits, such a procedural violation could not alter the final decision. Considering the argument that the severity of the infringement had been wrongly assessed, the DPA replied that, in light of Article 83 GDPR and the controller's yearly turnover, the fine was proportionate to the repeatedly found inconsistencies and violations in the discussed processing operations.

The DPA imposed a €3,200,000 fine on the controller, which was reduced to €1,200,000 considering mitigating circumstances, such as the cooperation of the controller and measures taken to remedy the violations.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"A healthcare provider (controller) requested a prior consultation from the DPA in line with Article 36 GDPR regarding its new Health Benefit Analysis tool. The system was designed to improve the preventive and proactive approach to healthcare by using algorithms to identify patients with health risks. After this, a healthcare professional would assess the need for treatment.

To assess the legality of the planned processing of personal data, the DPA decided to handle the case not as a prior consultation but as supervision. The DPA considered in particular whether using the Health Benefit Analysis tool for patients would constitute automated individual decision-making under Article 22 GDPR.","The DPA held that patients identified by the system for further examination would not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing. Instead, the healthcare professionals would make a final assessment considering other factors besides the system recommendation. However, for patients not selected by the system, the decision would be final and solely based on automated processing. Furthermore, it would significantly affect them because they would be deprived of the opportunity to receive a healthcare service.

Therefore, the DPA issued a warning to the controller under Article 58(2)(a) GDPR as the envisioned processing would violate Article 22 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 22, Article 58"
"The DPA received a number of complaints from data subjects about Amplifon, a company selling hearing aids (the controller). The controller allegedly sent them a written letter via post inviting them to a free hearing test, despite the fact that they had not previously consented to receiving such marketing communication. The DPA therefore launched an ex officio investigation on 1 January 2020.

The controller claimed that letter assessing the need for hearing tests were only sent to persons listed in the database provided by the Ministry of Interior. On average, the controller requested data every 2-3 months, with an average of 3-400.000 data subjects' names and addresses per request. All data were transferred to a separate, secure server by the controller's competent employees, and the entire contents of the device were irretrievably deleted after the transfer. The purpose of the data collection – stated by the controller in the request to the Ministry – was to contact and maintain contacts for direct marketing purposes and, in subsequent requests (after 23 February 2021), for market research.

In the controller's view, Article 3(1)(d) of the Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing allowed the collection of data from the sources specified in the legislation. Accordingly, the market researcher may request name and address data from the register of the Ministry of Interior for the purpose of contacting the data subject. Provided that the data subject had not refused the disclosure of his or her data.

The controller stated that it used consent of the data subjects as the legal basis, arguing that the data subjects had the possibility to withdraw their consent at the Ministry of Interior or the controller if they do not wish their personal data to be processed.","First, in the DPA's view, the silence of the data subject could not be accepted as an affirmative act. If the data subject did not take any active steps to give consent, the controller cannot infer that the data subject consented to the processing. Consent is also closely linked to adequate prior information, i.e. that the data subject had adequate information about the circumstances of the processing before giving consent. The DPA found that  this was clearly lacking in this case. Therefore, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 6(1) GDPR by unlawfully using consent as a legal basis.

Second, the DPA also found that, from 26 April 2019, the Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing no longer covered requests or processing for the purpose of contacting for direct marketing. In other words, as of 26 April 2019, the legal authorisation for processing for direct marketing purposes ceased to exist. The controller nevertheless continued to process the requested data for the purpose.

The DPA noted that following the controller's request to the Ministry of Interior dated 23 February 2021, the purpose of the processing was “to contact the public in the field of health promotion, including hearing and hearing loss.” However, in its previous applications, the purpose was “to inform the public about our hearing care services.” Thus, from March 2021, the controller no longer requested the data for direct marketing, but for market research purposes. The use of the personal data was also solely authorised for this purpose by the Ministry of Interior. The DPA was of the opinion that the controller adjusted its request to the Ministry of Interior to market research purposes in order to comply with the changed legal requirements, only to continue its processing for direct marketing purposes. The DPA therefore found that the controller violated the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. It misled the data subjects and the Ministry of Interior by disguising the true purpose of the processing, thereby also violating the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

The DPA emphasized that since the controller contacted potential patients after collecting personal data not from the data subject but from another source, it should have provided the information to the data subjects within a reasonable time, taking into account Article 14 GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the provided information sheet did not indicate the legal basis for the processing. Furthermore, it did not indicate the real purposes of the processing and the small font size of the notice made it inadequate. The DPA held that the controller had thereby violated Article 14(1) and (2) GDPR. Because it failed to provide clear and transparent information, the controller also violated Article 12(1) GDPR.

The DPA imposed a €200,000 fine on the controller and ordered the controller to delete all data of the data subjects, i.e. all name and address data provided by the Ministry of Interior.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 14"
"A data subject lodged a complaint with the Italian DPA because he received an email containing unsolicited marketing communication regarding ticket-sales for a play promoted by Teatro Colosseo (controller). The data subject stated that it never gave consent to the reception of such communications. Furthermore, the data subject complained about the controller’s failure to respond to its request to exercise its rights under Articles 15, 17 and 21 GDPR. Following the complaint, the DPA opened an investigation into the controller.

The controller stated that it never had access to the data subject's data. In fact, the marketing communication was allegedly sent by another company. Namely, one that it hired in the past for the promotion of a different event. This task was allegedly given orally to that company in return for remuneration. Confident in the guarantees offered by that company in the field of the promotion of shows and cultural events, also on behalf of third parties, the controller did not deem it necessary at the time to exercise a power of control or issue instructions.

Furthermore, the controller stated that the marketing company would have acted as an autonomous controller, because it would have independently determined the means of processing and the recipients of the communications. The marketing company used its own list of contacts, that was never in possession of the controller. To substantiate this claim, the controller added that it did not own the email address used to send the promotional message. This belonged to a third party, to which the marketing company further delegated the promotional activity.","Contrary to the controller’s claim, the DPA stated that the controller determined both the means and the purposes of the processing, as the promotional activity was performed in the name, on behalf of and in the interest of the controller. Furthermore, the content of the communication gave the data subject a legitimate expectation that the communication was sent directly by the controller, rather than by the marketing company. Therefore, it must be deemed as the controller in this case.

Regarding the use of a third party for promotional activities, the DPA found that the facts of the case outlined a picture of inadequate control by the controller. Instead of drawing up a legally binding deed, the controller limited itself to a mere verbal agreement. In addition, it neglected to obtain any documentation that would demonstrate compliance with the GDPR from the third party, e.g. the origin of the data, the information provided, and whether consent was obtained.

The DPA held that by using a third company's contact list to process the data subject's personal data for marketing purposes, the controller did not meet the requirements of lawfulness, fairness and transparency from Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. Therefore, the controller violated the principle of accountability provided by Article 5(2) and 24 GDPR for the failure to adopt adequate technical and organisational measures to effectively monitor the companies carrying out promotional activities in its interest.

The DPA also found a violation of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 130(1) and (2) of the Italian Privacy Code (Legislative Decree No. 196/2003), as the promotional message was sent without the consent of the data subject.

Consequently, the DPA imposed a fine of €1,000. It prohibited the controller to carry out any further processing for promotional purposes of data collected without the consent of the data subjects. In addition, the DPA ordered the controller, should it intend to use third parties for promotional activities, to adopt appropriate measures to ensure that personal data would be processed in compliance with applicable law by the latter. Last, the DPA ordered the controller to adopt appropriate measures to ensure an effective response to the exercise of data subjects' rights.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17, Article 21, Article 24"
"The municipality (the controller) published on its online Public Notice Board, as well in a press release, information about the data subject's dismissal from work. The publication contained a matriculation number, which made the data subject identifiable.

Subsequently, the data subject decided to file a complaint with the Italian DPA. The DPA initiated proceedings and requested more information from the controller.

The controller argued that the information had been put through pseudonymisation first and only employees knew how to decrypt it. Furthermore, the online Notice Board was not indexed in search engines. With regards to the press release, the controller argued that the text was anonymous and did not allow for the identification of the data subject.","Firstly, the Italian DPA held that the dissemination of personal data (such as publications on the Internet) by public entities is permitted, when provided for by law. Secondly, the matriculation number is considered an identification number, as it allows third parties to trace the identity of the data subject, and not authorised personnel only. Consequently, the DPA held that a matriculation number on online publications falls under the definition of ""personal data"" in Article 4(1) GDPR.

The DPA reminded the controller that, as defined in Recital 26 GDPR, pseudonymisation is a mere technical measure and still makes it possible to trace the identity of a data subject in an indirect way or through use of additional information. With regards to the press release, the DPA held that there was no derogation from the principles on the protection of personal data. The DPA also reiterated that the principles of lawfulness and data minimisation apply to publication on online public notice boards, as clarified in the ""Guidelines on the processing of personal data, also contained in administrative acts and documents, carried out for the purposes of publicity and transparency on the web by public entities and other obligated entities"".

The DPA found a violation of Article 2-ter of the Code on the Protection of Personal Data, as the provisions cited by the controller did not meet the requirement of a valid legal basis. Furthermore, the DPA found a breach of Articles 5(1)(a)(c) and 6 GDPR because the online dissemination of the data subject's personal data lacked an appropriate legal basis. The DPA confirmed that the controller did not meet the requirement of lawful processing of personal data.

It was also found that the processor  did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of confidentiality and security of the personal data of the data subjects, which led to the loss, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to certain personal data .","In October 2022, the Romanian DPA completed an investigation at the processor Compania Nationala Poșta Română SA and found a violation of the provisions of Article 32(1)(b) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR.

"JP/Politikens Hus A/S (controller) is an operator of the news website, www.eb.dk.

During the check, the website had a cookie consent solution allowing the visitors to click on three different boxes: ""Only necessary"" (in a red box), ""Customise settings"" (in a grey box) and ""Accept all"" (in a green box).

From the ""first layer"" of the consent solution, it appeared that the controller processed personal data for statistical and marketing purposes. In the ""second layer"", which the visitor could access by clicking on ""Customise settings"", the visitor could select the processing for preferences, statistics and marketing.","The DPA held that visitors of the controller's website did not give informed consent, as visitors who clicked on ""Accept all"" did not receive information about all processing purposes. Namely, information about the preferential purpose only appeared from the ""second layer"". As a result, the consent did not meet the requirements of Article 4(11) GDPR, and thus the controller could not rely on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing.

Furthermore, the DPA also held that using a traffic light-like colour and design scheme in the consent solution constitutes a form of ""guiding"" (nudging). Therefore, as it interferes with the user's ability to make an informed choice, it is incompatible with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

"A construction company (controller) suffered a data breach, which was triggered by the controller's employee opening a phishing email, which contained malware. The controller's virus scanner removed some of the malware, but the hacker still had access to the employee's computer and infected some additional servers and systems. The attacker used the access to uninstall the controller's anti-virus solution which resulted in the personal data of up to 113,000 employees being compromised. The attacker encrypted the data and made it unavailable for the controller. The compromised data included several categories of personal data as well as sensitive data and special categories of data. At the time of the attack, one of the two employees who received the phishing email had not undertaken data protection training. On 5 May 2020, the controller submitted a personal data breach notification to the UK DPA (DPA). The DPA subsequently commenced an investigation into the breach.","The DPA found that the controller failed to process personal data in a manner that ensured appropriate security of the personal data using appropriate technical and organisational measures required by Articles 5(1)(f) and Article 32 GDPR. This rendered the controller vulnerable to a cyber-attack which affected the personal data of up to 113,000 employees.

With regard to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, the DPA held that the controller failed to process personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical and organisational measures as required by Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

The DPA found that during the relevant period, the controller was processing personal data on unsupported operating systems which no longer received security updates at the time of the breach. The controller also failed to undertake any formal risk assessments in relation to using those systems. In addition, the controller also failed to implement appropriate end-point protection and failed to conduct regular and effective vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. The controller also failed to provide appropriate and effective information security training to its employees. Other conditions, including the failure to update a client-server communication protocol (SMB 1) to a newer version, the failure to conduct an effective and timely investigation into the cause of the initial attack and the failure to effectively manage access of privileged accounts (280 users within the domain administrator group), all contributed to a breach of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. Overall, the DPA accepted that each of the above contraventions, if considered in isolation, were not necessarily causative of the incident nor a serious contravention of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. However, the cumulative failures materially increased both the risk of an attack occurring, and increased the seriousness of the consequences of an attack. Taken together, the failures did constitute a serious contravention of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

The DPA also stated that the controller's failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk (Article 32(1) GDPR). Specifically, the DPA stated the use of outdated operating systems, outdated protocols, ineffective endpoint security and the failure to ensure employees had undertaken phishing training was contrary to Article 32(1)(b) GDPR, because the controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services. The controller also failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident, which was contrary to Article 32(1)(c) GDPR. The DPA described several instances were the personal data stored on different systems was unavailable for several months. Lastly, the controller also failed to  implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing, which was contrary to Article 32(1)(d) GDPR.

When calculating the financial penalties, the DPA considered the factors described in Article 83(2) GDPR to decide to impose a penalty or not. The DPA took the view that this was a significant contravention of the GDPR in particular regarding the volume of personal data processed and the nature of the personal data, which included special category data. The volume and type of personal data being processed by the controller required robust security measures to be put in place with appropriate controls and oversight. Further, the breach compromised personal data relating to up to 113,000 data subjects. Their personal data was processed unlawfully. This increased the seriousness and gravity of the breach. Despite the negligent nature of the breach, the DPA took into account the controller's size, and particularly the size of its workforce and the volume and nature of personal data it processed. This meant that higher standards of security were expected in comparison with a smaller organisation.

After also considering the mitigating factors, the DPA decided to impose a penalty on the controller of around €5,100,000 (GBP 4,400,000), on the basis that this would be effective, dissuasive and proportionate given the failings identified, the current status of the controller and steps taken to improve measures which mitigate the future risk to data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"

"The Belgian DPA's Inspection Service started an investigation of the regional government agency for tourism. The controller collects personal data of Airbnb hosts through Airbnb as intermediary. The controller is legally tasked to watch over the quality of the Airbnb hosts. This legal task forms the legal basis for the controller. The Inspection Service held that the controller couldn't rely on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, the controller interprets its legal obligations too broadly.

On top of that, the Inspection Service held that the controller breaches Article 12(1) GDPR, Article 13 GDPR and Article 14 GDPR because the information in their privacy policy was not concise, transparent, nor easily accessible, as well as containing wrong and missing information. The controller admits that this used to be the case, but that this issue has now been resolved.

Following, the Inspection Service held that the website placed non-strictly necessary cookies without providing a way to refuse the cookies, nor were the website visitors provided with clear information. The controller contests this and also states that a new website was launched in the meantime, which follows best practices.

Lastly, the Inspection Service held that the DPO was not proactively involved nor consulted, resulting in a breach of Article 38(1) GDPR and Article 39(1) GDPR. For the processing as described above, the controller stated that the DPO did not need to be consulted as the Logiesdecreet provided the legal basis to process data. However, the DPO did provide a positive advice afters the first contact of the Inspection Service.","First, the Belgian DPA checks whether the controller can rely on legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR to process the personal data of Airbnb hosts. This processing can only happen if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation. The GDPR does not require each separate processing to have its exclusive norm. The norm must be sufficiently clear and precise, its application must be foreseeable by data subjects.

The DPA sets out that the controller is responsible, by law in article 11 Logiesdecreet, for recognition and evaluation of touristic accommodation. The DPA holds that article 11 Logiesdecreet is unclear how personal data can be gathered through intermediaries. The legislator intended to allow the controller to gather contact details of accommodation hosts (which are often not published on the intermediaries' website), as such, it is foreseeable that personal data will be processed for this purpose. The processing is also necessary to reach the purpose. Without the personal data, the controller has no way to contact the hosts. The DPA also holds that the personal data is proportionate to reach the purpose, only the necessary information is requested. The DPA finds no breach of Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.

Secondly, the DPA holds that the cookie policy was indeed not sufficiently transparent and lacked several requirements. The controller is a government agency, it solely referred to the regional governmental DPA (Vlaamse Toezichtscommissie) to contact for complaints. The DPA reaffirms that even though the regional governmental DPA is competent to rule, the DPA is also competent and should be included in the privacy policy. The DPA suggests using a layered approach to make the privacy policy more easily digestible. Finally, the DPA concludes that the previous privacy policy breaches Article 12(1) GDPR, Article 13 GDPR and Article 14 GDPR but that the shortcomings have been resolved in the meantime.

The DPA dismisses the non-strictly necessary cookies report of the Inspection Service since it did not provide adequate prove.

Lastly, the DPA assesses whether the DPO should be been proactively involved. The DPA holds that the DPO is a key-figure regarding data protection. As such, a DPO must be involved for all matters concerning personal data, in a proper and timely manner. The fact that the Logiesdecreet predates the GDPR does not absolve the organisation from applying the GDPR and thus involving the DPO to check whether all processing of personal data is compliant. The DPA holds that the controller breached Article 38(1) GDPR and Article 39(1) GDPR.

The DPA reprimands the controller for its (past) breaches and dismisses the parts which did not lead to GDPR infractions. The DPA also reaffirms that it cannot impose a fine on a governmental agency.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 24, Article 25, Article 38, Article 39"
"In February 2022, a security breach occured at the Municipality of Dobrzyniewo Duże (the controller). There was a break-in at an employee's flat and a laptop was stolen containing files with personal data of individuals (data subjects). As a consequence, the confidentiality of the personal data was compromised. The controller determined the scale of the resulting breach, which showed that the stolen computer contained 51 records with personal data in the following areas: name, address of residence or stay and PESEL (personal identification number). The Polish DPA initiated an ex officio investigation into the security breach as well as the controller's data processing practices.","The DPA recalled the obligation of the controller to ensure confidentiality and integrity of personal data. Under the GDPR, the controller is obliged to ensure an adequate level of data protection through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, as well as measures aimed at the optimal configuration of the operating systems used by regularly testing, measuring and assessing the effectiveness of said measures in the form of security tests of the IT infrastructure. The DPA held that the controller did not take sufficient measures in order to prevent the security breach during the laptop theft, in breach of Article 32(1) GDPR.

Moreover, the DPA found a violation of Articles 24(1) and 25(1) GDPR because the controller failed to apply technical measures ensuring a level of security corresponding to the risk of infringement of the rights or freedoms of natural persons by ensuring the ability to continuously monitor the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the processing systems and services.

Since the confidentiality of the personal data in question was compromised as a result of the incident, the controller also violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. The consequence of a breach of the confidentiality principle by the controller was also a breach of the accountability principle referred to in Article 5(2) GDPR.

Using its powers under Article 58(2)(i) GDPR and taking into account the gravity and duration of the infringements, the DPA imposed a €1,700 on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32"
"A data breach was reported to the DPA by ING Bank NV Amsterdam Sucursala București (the controller). The controller claimed that unauthorized access to and disclosure of some of its customers' (the data subjects') personal information had occurred. Data from the identity card, contact information, financial information (transactions and products held, card data), and usernames and passwords for the Internet Banking module (Home'Bank) were all included in the data. As a result, third parties transferred money from the data subject's bank accounts. Following the notification, the DPA started an investigation into the controller.","During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller lacked adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by the processing. In particular, the DPA held that this led to unauthorised disclosure of and access to personal data of the data subjects. The DPA underlined that, according to the principle of integrity and confidentiality laid down in Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, the controller had the obligation to process personal data in a way that ensured their adequate security. This included protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or accidental damage, by taking appropriate technical or organisational measures. The DPA therefore held that the controller violated Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR and fined the controller €20,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"The controller is a limited liability company in Hungary and also part of the Samlerhuset Group, an international group of companies based in Amsterdam. It sold different versions of commemorative and historical coins, with a specific focus on Hungarian history. The controller acquired the data of its customers as follows: they can place an order by filling in a form, received as part of advertising materials via postal mail. This data includes name, address, phone number, e-mail address.

Since July 2020, the DPA received several complaints from data subjects concerning the processing of their data by the controller and objecting to its data processing practices. In most cases, the controller created a user account (profile) with the personal data provided during the purchase or ordering process. However, it only informed the data subjects afterwards about the processing. The DPA therefore carried out a test registration on the controller's website and analysed the privacy notices on the website and from the postal mail. Based on its findings, the DPA suspected an infringement of GDPR and launched an investigation.

During the DPA’s investigation, the controller provided the following information on its data processing: potential new customers received a promotional mailing by post. In the controller's view, this did not constitute direct marketing under the Hungarian Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing. The controller argued that the promotional material was sent to the data subjects together with a newspaper, to which they were subscribed pursuant to a contract with another separate company. Thus, the controller did not contact data subjects directly by itself. The data subjects could then contact the controller online, by phone or by post, in case they would like to order coins.

In the online shopping process, the information on data processing is linked at the end of the order. The controller emphasized that the online registration did not involve the processing of any more personal data than a purchase without registration. It was also possible to order products by phone or by post, without registering an online account. The data subjects gave their consent by signing the order form in writing for postal orders, verbally for phone orders and by ticking a specific checkbox for online orders.

The controller also informed the DPA that for the purpose of targeted advertising on Facebook and Google social media platforms, the controller manually selected – without automated decision-making – a group of its customers with an e-mail address for whom the given advertisement may be relevant. This list of addresses was hashed and uploaded to the Facebook and Google advertising systems for the display of the advertisement to data subjects whose email address hash matched an element of the uploaded hash list.

The controller further stressed that it found data protection highly important, and it employed a dedicated data protection officer (DPO) as well.","The DPA found that, on the form sent out by the controller, the information was provided in very small print, so barely legible. When requesting consent for direct marketing, only the identity of the controller was indicated, with a very general purpose to send “further favourable offers.” The information also stated that the processing was unlimited in time and scope, until consent would be withdrawn. The DPA noted that a more specific purpose limitation and other information as required under Article 13 GDPR, as well as the fact of data transfer abroad, were completely missing. The DPA stated that Article 13 GDPR only provides the bare minimum content. Additional, case-specific information would be necessary for transparency and informed choice. On the forms of the controller, the mandatory data were distinguished from the non-mandatory data with a tiny asterisk. Thus, the DPA found that the average data subject was not given clear and easily accessible information. It was not possible to indicate that you only wanted to provide your data to receive updates on an order, and not for direct marketing. Individual purposes and individual contact methods were not separated on the postal form.

Over the phone – if the data subjects shared that they did not have an internet connection – a list of data processors was read out to them. In this case, it was not possible either to choose whether the data subject wished to consent to be contacted only by certain means, e.g. by post only, by phone only, by e-mail only, or by any combination of these. As in the case of postal communications, no information was provided about other forms of processing, such as Google and Facebook targeted advertising.

For online orders, the data subject could easily access the privacy notice, which contained information on data processing related to direct marketing. However, the DPA found that it was not possible to give specific, separate consent for receiving emails and targeted advertising through Google and Facebook. The DPA noted that the absence of any meaningful information on the use of these complex services in itself raised a serious validity issue in relation to consent.

With regard to the legal basis for consent, the DPA stressed that consent was not intended to be a general authorization for the controller to process any personal data without restriction, at any time and for any reason, irrespective of other legal conditions. It was only valid when requested for specific, separately identifiable purposes, and preceded by appropriate information that puts the data subject in a position to make an informed decision. Article 12(1) GDPR explicitly requires the controller to be result-oriented, i.e. to provide the data subject with the assistance necessary to enable him or her to exercise all his or her data subject rights in an informed manner. The DPA deemed it not the responsibility of the data subject to obtain the information from another source. It should be readily and reasonably available to them at the time of the request for consent. The DPA concluded a data subject would most likely not look online for information on data processing before placing an order by post or phone. This is also not expected by GDPR. The DPA held that the controller had an active obligation to provide the information to the data subject, appropriate for the communication channel used.

The DPA further stated that there was currently no DPO under the name of the controller in the designated database operated by the DPA (accessible for everyone). The controller also did not prove otherwise that it had in fact appointed a DPO. DPA noted that, if there was a technical reason beyond the control of the controller for which the entry was not made, it could have been detected and corrected by the controller in the last 4 years since the introduction of the GDPR, if it really considers data protection to be of high importance.

In short, the DPA found that the processing was explicitly for profit, using small print and without easily accessible information, implementing a poor business practice that was, and is problematic, even before the GDPR. The lack of adequate information put the data subjects in a position where they were not aware of their rights and how to exercise them. Therefore, the DPA fined the controller €73,500. The DPA further instructed the controller to modify its data processing practices in relation to direct marketing in order to properly separate specific purposes, obtaining the consent of data subjects, and providing them with adequate prior information appropriately. Also, to delete contact personal data where there was no valid consent.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13"
"The Portuguese DPA started an investigation into the Municipality of Setubal (controller) after a journalistic article from the newspaper Expresso was published titled Ukrainians welcomed in CDU Chamber by Pro-Putin Russians' (""Ucranianos recebidos em Câmara CDU por russos Pró-Putin"").

This article contained anonymous accounts of Ukrainian refugees. According to the Article, Russian citizens were present in the same room where Ukrainian refugees' personal data was stored (such as copies of identification documents). These Russian citizens - allegedly part of an Eastern European Immigrants' Association (EDINSTVO), an organisation for the support of eastern European migrants - also asked the refugees questions about the whereabouts of their relatives and what they were doing in Ukraine. In total, two members of the EDINSTVO were integrated by the controller into the Setúbal Office of Ethnicities and Immigration (SEI) in order to provide assistance, counselling and help to the refugees. According to the author of the article, these Russian citizens were accused in the article of sharing this personal data with the Russian Government.

This all happened in the framework of a Municipal Refugee Helpline (LIMAR), which was created in March 2022. The controller was responsible for the processing done by this helpline. The Helpline used two rooms of the controller's building in order to offer their services, one for the customer service and the other for archiving. Both rooms were only accessible for members of the helpline.

The helpline used two forms in order to collect the data from refugees seeking attendance: an assistance form and telephone assistance form. Using these forms, personal data was collected by the controller. Among other things, the controller collected the name, address, date of birth, marital status, information on the support network (identifying the places and people they might stay with and their respective households) and information on the period they might stay with the people in that support network, in addition to describing the specific situation of each refugee. The assistance forms were handwritten and were stored in a filing cabinet. All collected personal data was later also put into an Excel file which was protected by password.

Additionally, forms were accompanied by a declaration of consent for processing. The controller asked refugees for consent to authorise that the data records collected may be shared with other services or entities for the purpose of to specific responses or to provide social support adjusted to the situation adjusted to the situation, with the guarantees of privacy and non-discrimination'. Furthermore, together with the assistance forms, refugees were also offered to sign up for Portuguese language courses, for which they needed to provide a copy of an identification document.

In this context, one of the Russian citizens, who acted as a translator, was on medical leave for some time. This translator was informally substituted by her husband. The translator had given her husband her login-credentials to access the helpline's systems. This change was not documented or formalised in any way. The husband, who was not a controller's employee, helped to collect and copy personal data and documents from various refugees and acted as a translator himself.","The DPA found that the controller had violated the integrity and confidentiality principle from Article 5(1)(f) GDPR by not defining organisational measures for safeguarding information, policies or guidelines for the secure management of information. Nor did the controller determine a procedure, together with the Eastern European Immigrants' Association, that would regulate access and handling of the processed data. The exception regarding the non-existence of these policies and/or guidelines was an e-mail from the IT Division on the security of computer access passwords, email and internet. Article 5(1)(f) GDPR was also breached by allowing people outside the controller's services to access computer equipment used for processing personal data without a specific access profile, as well as by granting them access to information of refugees supported through the Helpline. The principle was further breached by the controller for its use of Excel files for the management and storage of information relating to a group of vulnerable parties (refugees). These Excel files did not have any audit records. Therefore, these files did not allow anyone to know who accessed them, when the files were accessed and what operations were carried out. The fact that the excel files were password protected did not mitigate this fact.

The DPA also found that the data storage periods had not been defined, nor were the criteria for establishing storage periods. This constituted a violation of the storage limitation principle ((Article 5(1)(e) GDPR)).  Also, no information was provided to the data subjects about the identity of the controller, the purposes of the processing, the recipients or categories of recipients, the rights of the data subjects, or the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. The DPA noted that, at least, the entities that were involved in this procedure were known to the controller, so they could have been mentioned to the data subjects, together with their data subject rights. Lastly, the DPA highlighted that the only reference made to data protection legislation was obsolete. Hence, the DPA concluded that the controller also violated Article 13 GDPR. The DPA also found that the controller had not appointed a DPO which resulted in a violation of Article 37 GDPR. A DPO was only appointed after the start of this procedure, on 22 September 2022.

The DPA also found that no data protection impact assessment (DPIA) had been carried out in order to analyse the processing of personal data in this context, which was required when processing data of vulnerable data subjects, according to the EDPB Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (p. 12). However, the DPA did not specify that Article 25 GDPR had been breached.

The DPA acknowledged that this was an emergency situation and that this could mitigate the degree of gravity of the infringement with regard to some elements, such as parts of the information obligation (Articles 13(1) and 13(2) GDPR), as well as the storage limitation obligations. However, the DPA also remarked that some other violations constituted proof of structural incompliance and were therefore of more gravity. Also, according to the DPA, the Helpline project had been discussed within the Setúbal Local Council for Social Action (CLASS), and therefore important matters such as the fundamental right to privacy and data protection from vulnerable people such as refugees should have also been discussed, despite the urgency.

For the above violations, the CNPD imposed a fine of €120,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and a fine of €100,000 for the violation of Article 37 GDPR. The DPA issued a reprimand for the violations of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR and Article 13 GDPR. This resulted in a total fine of €220,000. The two fines were nonetheless accumulated together, following Portuguese legal principles, which resulted in a fine of €170.000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 37"
"A political party used Google docs to store data of sympathisers and addressees of mailings in Excel files. The files were leaked and made publicly available, the link of the files also being published in an article on a political portal. Given that a large number of data subjects and special categories of data were concerned, the DPA (NAIH) conducted an inspection and found that the security of the processing was not sufficiently ensured by the controller. The controller also did not respond to the demand of the authority to indicate the measures taken to secure the data and to notify the data subjects.","1) A) The Controller has not respected Article 32, paragraph (1), point (a) and(b) and paragraph (2) of that article of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the protection of natural persons in respect of processing of personal data and the) free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter: General Data Protection Regulation) in not applying data security proportionate to the risks of storing data of party sympathisers and activists.

"In May 2022, the Norwegian DPA was approached by a grocery chain and a payment transaction provider regarding an instruction the former had received from the national statistical institute Statistics Norway (SSB), to submit purchase data (""bongdata"" in Norwegian) to them. The DPA had also received several complaints and inquiries from private parties regarding this matter, and in June they asked SSB, by letter, to clarify. Following their reply, the DPA and SSB had a meeting in August.

The various interactions clarified that SSB had instructed the main grocery chains in Norway (Rema 1000, NorgesGruppen, Coop and Bunnpris, accounting for about 99% of the Norwegian grocery market) to start submitting purchase data (""bongdata"" in Norwegian) to them on a regular basis, including:

* name of item
* price per item* total amount of the receipt
* payment method
* amount per payment method
* start and end time of the purchase
* ID of returns
* ID for terminated purchase
* ID of offers/discounts

The data would be reported directly from the point of sale systems so that SSB would receive the data continuously. Purchased items would be classified into product groups and consumers would be classified by size and type of household, income, level of education and country region. This would be contingent on a connection to transactional data/bank account number and then birth date.

The purchase data do not in themselves contain any personal data. The intention is, however, to connect these with transactional data which then makes it possible to relate the data to an individual person. SSB will link these to transaction data quickly after continuously receiving them, and thus the DPA finds that it is correct to view the purchase data as personal data from the point of collection, and references Recital 26 GDPR. Because of this, the DPA assessed the interference the collection of purchase data represents.

SSB's claimed legal basis for the processing was the Norwegian Statistics Act § 10 Duty to provide information, which states that ""any person must provide the data that are necessary to develop, produce or disseminate official statistics if so ordered by Statistics Norway"". The purpose of the intended processing was to develop, produce and disseminate official statistics as per the Statistics Act, and SSB considered the processing to be necessary. During the investigation, SSB shared two data protection impact assessments (DPIA) with the DPA, one dated 27 January 2021 and the other from the period October 2021 to June 2022.","From the first DPIA, the DPA highlighted the fact that information about nearly all grocery purchases for the entire population of Norway would be collected, stored indefinitely, without allowing the data subjects to exercise their rights (because of exceptions in the national regulations). The DPA noted that SSB would receive extensive data more or less in real-time and with a high degree of accuracy, about every individual's grocery shopping, including where, how and what they purchased, for any purchase made at stores covering 99% of the Norwegian market (unless they paid by cash).

The DPA makes an interesting discussion on the right to respect for a private life under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This right is adopted in Norwegian law, both through ECHR and the Constitution § 102. When public authorities collect and store personal data, this is in itself interfering with privacy. The DPA emphasizes that in a democratic society, legal certainty is a central foundation and a principle in a democracy is that the state does not inferfere with citizens' private life without a basis in law (the principle of legality, as anchored in the Constitution § 113). The requirements for this basis in law increases with the severity of the interference. So even if SSB has a general basis in law for creating statistics, the interference in privacy in this particular case is so great that the DPA finds it cannot be justified with this only.

SSB tried to claim that the DPA was wrong in identifying them as ""the state"", to which the DPA responds that SSB is a public authority, funded over the National Budget, and despite being an independent authority clearly a part of the Norwegian state.

On 29 November 2022, the DPA notified SSB of their intention to ban the planned processing. SSB then submitted their comments and a legal consideration by a law firm, in January 2023. This did not, however, affect the DPA's intention to ban the processing.

The DPA found that SSB's assessments are inadequate and their impression is that SSB has an insufficient understanding of the concept of personal data protection, privacy as a fundamental right and the value of adequate privacy. The DPA viewed that collection and storage of personal data by public authorities is an intrusion in in itself which must form the basis for the assessment of any interference with privacy.

Consequently, the DPA held that SSB did not have a sufficient supplementary legal basis as per Article 6(3) GDPR to process the transaction personal data (""bongdata"" in Norwegian) as intended, and based on Article 58(2)(f) GDPR imposed a ban on the processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 58"
"The French DPA (CNIL) started an investigation into Discord, a company based in the United States (controller). This controller provided a free of charge online service that allowed data subjects to communicate online using text, voice - and video.

The investigation service of the DPA  determined several shortcomings.

During the investigation, the controller stated that it did not have a written data retention policy. The investigation service confirmed that there were 2,474,000 French data subject accounts in the controller’s database that had not been used for more than three years and 58,000 accounts that had not been used for more than five years. During the procedure, the controller added a data retention policy, which described that the controller would delete user accounts after two years of inactivity.

The investigation service found that the information the controller provided regarding data retention periods was incomplete. There were no specific periods or criteria for determining these retention periods. The controller changed this element of the privacy policy during the procedure.

The investigation service also addressed a specific problem about the application for Microsoft Windows: when a data subject, logged in to a voice room, closed the controller’s application window by clicking on the ""X"" icon at the top right of the application, the application would continue to run in the background and the data subject would remain logged in. However, in the majority of Microsoft Windows applications, clicking on the ""X"" will close the application. This 'background minimization' was activated after the first install of the controller's software. The data subject was not informed about this background minimization.  During the procedure, the controller implemented a pop-up window to alert data subjects that the application was still running, when the application window was closed for the first time. The controller also informed data subjects that this setting (remain logged in after closure of application) could be changed in the settings.

At the time of the online investigation, when creating an account, the controller accepted a password of six characters including letters and numbers. The controller also adjusted this during the proceedings: it now required data subjects to use a password of at least eight characters, with at least three of the four different character types. Also, after ten unsuccessful login attempts, the controller now required a captcha prompt to be solved, which was previously not the case.

The investigation service also determined that the controller had previously deemed it unnecessary to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA).  During the procedure, the controller carried out two impact assessments, in which the controller concluded that its processing was not likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.","Competence of the DPA

The DPA determined that the controller processed personal data of French data subject and held that the GDPR was applicable pursuant of Article 3(2)(a) GDPR. The DPA determined that the controller offered services intended for data subjects in the European Union by considering several factors. Among other factors, The DPA considered for example that almost all pages on the controller’s website and in the controller’s application were available in French at the time of the investigation.

The DPA determined that it was competent to handle this case because the one-stop shop"" mechanism (Article 56 GDPR) did not apply in this case, because the controller did not have an establishment on the territory of any EU Member State. Therefore, each national supervisory authority was competent to monitor GDPR compliance on the territory of this member state (Article 55 GDPR).

Failure to define and respect a data retention period appropriate to the purpose (Article 5(1)(e) GDPR)

The DPA confirmed that the controller did not have a written date retention policy at the time of the investigation. The DPA also confirmed that there were 2,474,000 French data subject accounts in the controller’s database that had not been used for more than three years and 58,000 accounts that had not been used for more than five years. The DPA held that this was a violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR, because the controller could not rely on the contractual relationship to indefinitely keep storing accounts of data subjects who were inactive, but had not unsubscribed. The reason for this was because a new account could be created free of charge. Therefore, an inactive data subject who wished to use the service again, could do so by recreating a new account.

Failure to comply with the obligation to provide information (Article 13 GDPR)

The DPA stated that at the time of the investigation, the information regarding data retention periods was incomplete. There were no specific periods or criteria for determining these periods. The DPA held that this was a violation of Article 13 GDPR, because retention periods were stated in a generic manner and were not sufficiently explicit.

Failure to ensure data protection by default (Article 25(2) GDPR)

The DPA also found a violation of Article 25(2) GDPR regarding the controllers “X” icon at the top right corner of its Windows application. The DPA determined that the  behaviour of the controller's application was different in comparison with other Windows applications. The DPA considered that the fact that data subjects would click the “X” icon in the controller’s application, without actually closing the application, could lead to a situation where this data subject could still be heard by other members in the voice room, when the data subject actually thought he/she had left the voice room.

The DPA stated that data subjects could not reasonably expect the application to keep running after clicking the 'X' icon, because communication apps in general either inform the data subject about this 'background minimization' or provide the option to data subjects to enable it themselves. The DPA stated that because of this situation, the data subject's personal data could be communicated to third parties without the data subject necessarily being aware of this. The DPA noted that this setting, without sufficiently clear and visible information, could present significant risks for data subjects, in particular for intrusion into their private life.

Failure to ensure the security of personal data (Article 32 GDPR)

At the time of the online investigation, the controller accepted a password of six characters including letters and numbers for creating a user account. The DPA considered that the controller's passwords were not strong enough, taking into account the undemanding password policy and the volume of personal data processed by the controller. This resulted in a risk of compromise for the user accounts in question, including the personal data these accounts contained. The DPA referred to its own recommendations for passwords (in deliberation No. 2017-012 of 19 January 2017), which entailed that passwords should compromise at least eight characters, containing at least three or four categories of characters (upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters) and that authentication should include a limitation on access of the user account, such as a timeout of access after several failed requests to login.

Failure to carry out a data protection impact assessment (Article 35 GDPR)

The controller previously considered that it was not necessary to carry out a DPIA. The DPA considered that the controller should have done so, looking at the large scale of personal data processed and the fact that the controller's service was also intended used by children aged fifteen, of which the controller was fully aware, according to the DPA.

Fine

The DPA imposed a fine of 800,000 euros on the controller. The amount of the fine was based on several factors, and took into account the efforts made by the controller throughout the procedure to become GDPR compliant.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 21, Article 25, Article 32, Article 35, Article 55, Article 56"
"The data subject submitted a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR with Douglas Italia S.p.a (the controller). However, she did not receive a response. Therefore, she submitted a complaint with the Italian DPA, asking it to assess what happened. The DPA contacted the controller, requesting further information on the matter. The controller replied that the legal basis for processing was the data subject's membership in its loyalty programme. The controller held that the data subject gave free and specific consent for the processing, and that any refusal to processing would not have prevented her from obtaining the loyalty card. The controller also stated that it had not received the data subject's request, but confirmed that her revocation of consent and cancellation was now handled. The DPA was not satisfied with this response, and initiated an inspection at the controller's headquarters.

Prior to the inspection, the controller highlighted that it was formed in 2019 as a result of the merging of three companies (Limoni Spa, La Gardenia Beauty Spa and Profumerie Douglas Spa) and that it was subject to the management and supervision of its German parent company, Douglas GMBH.

Management of requests to exercise data subject rights

During the on-site inspection, the controller showed the DPA how they normally manage data subject's requests. The DPA concluded that the failure to respond to the data subject's request was a one-time occurrence, compared to the management of other requests, which, as a rule, were handled correctly and timely (within 2-3 days). The DPA therefore decided not pursue an investigation into the possible violation of Article 12(3) GDPR.

Data collection through the Douglas app

The DPA also tested the data collection through the controller's app. The DPA tested the app, and found that the during registration, the user was invited to accept the general terms and conditions, privacy policy, cookie policy and more with a single button ('Ok, I understand, I agree'). Later, when creating the account, the app asked for an e-mail address and date of birth.

The processing of customer data acquired through the merger

During the inspection, the DPA also asked the controller to provide some examples of separate marketing disclosures and consents, for the three companies, before the merger. However, the controller was not able to provide any proof or information regarding the latter. It justified this by stating that it was no longer possible due to the creation of a single database after the merger.

Retention of data relating to customer who have not renewed their loyalty card

The DPA also found that the data of 3,288,170 customers of the three pre-existing companies, who did not activate or renew the loyalty card, were stored on the servers of the German parent company.

The information given to customers

Additionally, the DPA discovered that the information provided to customers on purposes of processing and the legal basis was incomplete and inadequate. The privacy policy informed interested parties that their data would be processed for a variety of purposes on the basis of consent. However, no information was provided on how data collected separately by the three companies was processed after the merger.

Telemarketing carried out by the stores

Regarding the controller's telemarketing activities, the DPA found that customers who consented only to receive promotional SMS notifications, could in reality also receive promotional phone calls, and vice versa. Moreover, the controller admitted to having no scripts prepared for how to conduct the promotional phone calls with respect to protecting the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

Data processing via blogs

Last, the DPA found that there was no information about data processing when interacting with the controller's blog in its privacy policy. The DPA asked the controller to provide the quantitative data of data subjects who had interacted with the blog, as well as the most recent data relating to the registered comments and information on their registration, storage, and the methods and purposes for which they are used. The controller was not able to provide this information.","Data collection through the Douglas app

The DPA held that the app's configuration was unclear and ambiguous regarding the real object of the consent requested from the user. The DPA stated that without adequate information provided by the controller, consent cannot be a valid legal basis for the processing pursuant to Recital 32 and Article 4(11) GDPR. Information relating to the purposes of processing must also be easily accessible pursuant to Article 12(1) GDPR, in the broader context of the principle of transparency.  Therefore, the DPA found that the controller violated Article 7 GDPR, as consent was neither freely given nor specific. Consequently, the processing activities had no legal basis, in violation of Article 6 GDPR.

In addition, the DPA pointed out that the controller did not yet adapt the management of cookies to the indications provided for in the 'Cookies and other tracking tools guidelines' of 10 June 2021. This breach aggravated the unlawfulness of the situation. Therefore, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 12(1) GDPR for failing to take all measures necessary to provide the data subjects with adequate information on the processing operations carried out.

The processing of customer data acquired through the merger

With regard to the failure to produce documentation relating to the three merged companies, the DPA considered it appropriate to not establish a violation, since the controller finally provided, although very late, the requested information, in compliance with the principle of accountability (Articles 5(2) and 24 GDPR).

Retention of data relating to customers who have not renewed their loyalty card

During the investigation, the DPA established that vast amount of personal data relating to customers who never activated or renewed their loyalty card was persistently stored in the controller's database. The DPA held that this practice violated the principle of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b) GDPR) and the principle of storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e) GDPR).

The information given to customers

As established during the investigation, the privacy notice of the controller did not provide complete information to interested parties. Specifically, there was no information as to how personal data acquired through the merger would be processed. Hence, the DPA found a violation of Article 13(2)(a) GDPR.

Telemarketing carried out by the stores

The DPA held that the discrepancy between what kind of promotional content customers consented to (SMS, phone calls or both), and what they could receive in practice (both SMS and phone calls), as well as the lack of scripts for marketing calls, violated Articles 5(2), 24 and 25(1) GDPR.

Data processing via blogs

At last, the DPA established a violation of Article 5(2), Article 24 and Article 13 GDPR, for failing to provide evidence of the purposes and criteria for the storage of personal data processed through the blog and for the blog's lack of privacy notice.

Conclusion

In light of these violations, the DPA adopted a series of corrective measures against the controller under Article 58(2) GDPR with the aim of bringing its processing activities in line with the provisions of the GDPR. The controller had to update its privacy and cookie policy, delete personal data collected more than 10 years ago (except for ongoing disputes) and delete or pseudonymise more recently collected personal data. Finally, the controller had to adopt adequate organisational and technical measures aimed at ensuring the correct conservation of its customers' data to comply with the principles of purpose and storage limitation as well as data minimisation.

In conclusion, the DPA also imposed a €1,400,000 fine one the controller for the violation of multiple GDPR provisions.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25"
"Two data subjects received unsolicited commercial emails from a hotel booking website (the controller). They objected to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes and requested their email address to be deleted form the controller's register. However, the controller did not comply with the request and continued sending unsolicited emails. The same happened to the second data subject. Additionally, one of the data subjects submitted an access request to the controller but did not receive a response.

Both data subjects filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA. The DPA initiated an investigation, trying to contact the controller several times. After not receiving any reply, the DPA started sanctioning proceedings.

During the proceedings, the controller argued that it was not aware of the data protection aspect of its activity and only considered it ""simple advertising"". Moreover, the controller stated that it had given instructions to delete the data from the mailing list, but an error occurred, as a result of which the personal data was still in the register. Furthermore, according to the controller, once the error was remedied, the data subjects were orally informed by a phonecall about the deletion of their data.","The DPA held that the controller provided misleading information in its privacy policy. Although the controller claimed that the legal basis for processing personal data in relation to newsletters and marketing was consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, the privacy policy mentioned the legitimate interest of the controller. Hence, it confused the data subjects, as to which legal basis was actually used. Moreover, the privacy policy did not expressly mention the purposes of processing personal data. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 12(1) GDPR as the data subjects were not clearly informed of the purposes and the legal basis for processing.

Additionally, the DPA established a violation of Article 6(1) GDPR because the consent given by the data subjects was not informed since the controller provided conflicting information about the legal basis. Furthermore, the consent was not obtained separately for every specific purpose as there were no separate checkboxes for data marketing purposes.

The DPA also held that the controller did not have proof of consent, violating Article 7(1) GDPR. The controller also violated Article 5(2) GDPR as it never sent to the DPA the requested proves of consent or an assessment of balancing the legitimate interests at stake.

The DPA emphasised that data processing for marketing purposes is of a special nature. The DPA referred to Article 21(2) GDPR, according to which the data subject can at any time object to personal data processing for direct marketing purposes. In such cases, the controller has no discretion, but must delete the personal data (Article 17(1)(c) GDPR).

Regarding the access request made by one of the data subjects, the DPA found a violation of Article 15 GDPR as the controller never responded to the request.

For the above-discussed violations, the Hungarian DPA fined the controller HUF 500,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17"
"Since 2020, the US company Alpha Exploration Co. Inc. (the controller), has offered and operated the social network Clubhouse. The social network is based exclusively on voice interactions that take place in conversation rooms. Users can choose to open a thematic room or enter another person's room as a listener. From January 2022, using the platform's new features Clips & Replays, users can (i) store and record also part of the conversations on the platform and (ii) share the same recordings with third parties. On the basis of profiling activities, Clubhouse allows other users to find people who may have a common interest or connection. In addition, Clubhouse collects contact data from the address book of its users' devices. This collection would allow users to connect with people they know, and to invite friends to join them on Clubhouse.

Following press reports that revealed the existence of several problems with the way personal data were processed by the controller, the Italian DPA opened an ex officio investigation. The DPA also received a report highlighting a number of critical issues of Clubhouse relating to security, the exercise of data subjects’ rights, the lack of an EU representative, profiling activities, and the retention of personal data. On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA informed the controller a number of violations that the DPA had found following a first assessment on the matter.","The DPA started by considering whether it was competent to make a decision regarding the controller's processing activities. The DPA considered that the conditions for applicability of the GDPR set out in Article 3(2)(a) GDPR were met since the controller offered its services to data subjects in the EU. The DPA claimed jurisdiction on the basis of Article 55(1) GDPR because Clubhouse (i) was operated by a company that had no establishment in the EU and (ii) constituted cross-border processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1)(23) GDPR because it affected data subjects in more than one Member State.

Following the closure of the investigation, the DPA considered that the controller committed the following violations in the context of the provision of the Clubhouse service. The DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 6 and 7 GDPR for processing carried out for the purposes of marketing, profiling, profile sharing, and audio recording in the absence of an appropriate legal basis.

With regard to processing carried out for marketing purposes, despite what the controller had stated, there was a reference in the privacy policy to the direct marketing purpose for which consent was collected on the basis of an 'opt-out' mechanism. Therefore, the DPA declared that such processing was unlawful because it was carried out on the basis of an implicit consent mechanism, which was not in line with the conditions for valid consent set out in Article 7 GDPR.

With regard to the processing carried out by means of the Clips & Replays function, on the basis of allegedly being necessary for the performance of a contract, the DPA indicated that the terms of service needed to be updated to make the processing more transparent. Indeed, the terms of service did not mention the Clips & Replays function.

According to the terms of service, Clubhouse would indiscriminately record every conversation in every room on the basis of its legitimate interest in 'monitoring' possible violations of its guidelines. The DPA declared this processing unlawful because it was carried out in the absence of an appropriate legal basis under Article 6 GDPR. Contrary to the controller's contention, the processing could not be justified on the basis of legitimate interest because it would have entailed widespread and pervasive monitoring, and thus be disproportionate.

The DPA also declared unlawful the processing for profiling purposes, justified by the controller with the need to execute the contract. According to the DPA, the user would in fact have been able to use the service even without submitting any information in addition to that required for the creation of the account and without allowing the controller to carry out further processing regarding the manner of their interactions with the platform.

Finally, the DPA noted that the privacy policy disclosed that personal data of users is processed both for the provision of the service as well as for the purpose of developing and improving Clubhouse products. The legal basis for processing would reside in the legitimate interest of the controller. In this regard, the DPA observed that, in the absence of further specifications, if the processing involved profiling operations, it would appear to be entirely identical to the processing, discussed above, aimed at providing the service to the data subject and, in such a case, would also be unlawful in the lack of a valid legal basis.

The DPA established a violation of Article 13 GDPR in that the controller did not provide, until 4 August 2021, information about the processing, and a violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR, for having rendered, after 4 August 2021, a privacy notice lacking the requirements of clarity, transparency and comprehensibility.

The DPA also found a violation of Article 14 GDPR because the controller failed to provide non-users with information on the processing of their telephone numbers in the event that the user decided to synchronise their contacts on the Clubhouse platform. The DPA instructed the controller to include a link to a specific policy in the text of any invitation sent to non-users to join the community.

The DPA also confirmed that Articles 5(1)(e) and 13 GDPR had been infringed because the controller did not provide sufficient information about the data retention periods for the specific purposes pursued. According to the DPA, it was also unclear that the audio files created with the Clips & Replays function would be retained until the possible termination of the account by the user who generated them, unless the user requested their deletion.

With regard to the representative in the EU appointed by the controller, the DPA established a breach of Article 13(1)(a) GDPR for not having duly indicated the representative's contact details. The representative is not a mediator or facilitator but, as specified in Recital 80 GDPR, the person who acts on behalf of the controller with regard to the GDPR obligations. The DPA held that the role of the representative was too ambigious byt not indicating that it actually had the mandate to act on behalf of the controller, violating Article 27(4) GDPR.

The DPA confirmed that the controller violated Article 35 GDPR for not having carried out a DPIA despite the fact that the processing activities performed fell within the types of processing that require an impact assessment, given that they took the form of profiling users on the basis of their preferences and that the data processed could also include those of minors.

In conclusion, the DPA imposed a series of corrective measures on the controller, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, ordering the controller to bring its processing activities in line with the GDPR. The DPA also imposed an administrative fine of €2,000,000 on the controller for the violation of multiple GDPR provisions, as discussed above.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 27, Article 32, Article 35, Article 58"
"Between October 2018 and November 2019, the DPA received 41 complaints regarding FREE, a French communications provider (controller), after which the DPA started an investigation based on 10 of these complaints. Some of these complaints concerned access requests for information regarding the data broker from which the controller got personal data. The controller did not respond to these requests in time or provided incomplete answers. According to the controller, the requests were not answered in time due to human error. However, specifically with regard to information regarding the source of the data, the controller stated that it was not obliged to reveal information that was deemed a 'business secret' according to recital 63 and Article 15(4) GDPR (in this case, the identity of the data broker who supplied the data). The controller also stated that it had recently changed its internal procedure, and now asked its data brokers to also provide the identity of the primary source of the data collection, which the controller could then provide to the data subjects.

The data subjects also requested the deletion of their e-mail accounts. However, the DPA confirmed that data subject’s personal data was still present in the controller’s database after they had submitted their erasure requests. Also, these e-mail accounts still had the status of ‘active’ and data subjects were still able to access their e-mails.

On 8 February 2019, the controller also notified the DPA of a personal data breach. The controller had distributed 4.137 refurbished hardware boxes, called FREE-boxes, to new subscribers. The main use of this FREE-box was to store television programmes, but could also be used to store personal photos and personal video’s. The DPA found that these boxes still contained the personal data of subscribers who had used this hardware previously. The controller did not wipe the data from the device. The controller had accidentally deleted a procedure from its security measures, intended to erase the data stored on the boxes before redistribution. Three years after the breach was reported, 322 boxes were still used by subscribers, without the controller knowing if these boxes contained data of previous subscribers. These boxes were only remotely deactivated by the controller on July 2022, also more than three years after the breach.","The DPA determined that the controller violated the following GDPR provisions.

Failure to respect the right of access (Articles 12 and 15 GDPR)

The DPA determined that the controller violated Articles 12 and 15 GDPR, after the DPA confirmed that the controller did not respond to the data subject’s access requests within one month or had provided incomplete answers regarding the source of personal data. The DPA also stated that the controller’s argument for not disclosing the source of the data because of 'business secrecy' was not valid. The DPA specified that the data subject’s requests were requests for information according to Article 15(1) GDPR. The ‘Business secrecy’ exception only applied to Article 15(4) GDPR, where a data subject would request a copy of their data, which was not the case here.

The DPA continued that any processing had to comply with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and that personal data had to be processed in a transparent manner. The DPA stated that the data subject’s right of access constituted a fundamental guarantee for the transparency of data processing methods by the controller. When the data subject filed an access request, the controller had to communicate the specific source of the data. The controller was only exempt from this obligation when the controller did not have this information. The fact that the controller had not provided the identity of the data broker despite possessing this information, prevented the data subject to verify the lawfulness of the processing carried out. The right of access regarding the primary source of the data was therefore limited by the controller.

Failure to respect the right to erasure

The DPA also determined that the controller violated Articles 12 and 17 GDPR. The DPA stated that the erasure requests of the data subjects were clear. The data subjects had also used a dedicated form provided by the controller. However, the personal data of the data subjects was still in the controller’s database after the erasure requests. Also, the controller only answered the erasure requests after approximately three years, which was in violation of Article 12(3) GDPR. The DPA also determined a violation of Article 17(1)(a) GDPR, because data subject's e-mail accounts were still active and the e-mails were still accessible several years after the requests were submitted.

Failure to ensure the security of personal data (Article 32 GDPR)

The DPA held that the controller violated Article 32 GDPR because of several reasons.

Password requirements: When a new user account was created on the controller’s website, the controller generated a random password of eight characters which could only contain one type of character. This generated password was not strong enough according to the DPA. The DPA determined that use of a short or simple password without imposing specific categories of characters and without additional security measures, such as blocking measures, may lead to successful attacks by unauthorised third parties.

Storing passwords in clear text: All generated passwords were stored in plain text in the controller’s subscriber database until 23 January 2020. The DPA stated that this allowed any person with access to the controller's customer database to collect the passwords of each subscriber, who could then access the user accounts of these data subjects.

Transmitting passwords in clear text:  Besides that, the passwords were sent by the controller by e-mail or postal mail, in clear text, to the data subjects who created their account on the website. These passwords were of a permanent nature and without a requirement from the controller that these passwords had to be changed later. The DPA stated that this transmission could allow third parties intercepting transmissions to get unauthorized access to user account, as long as these passwords did not have a limited duration and were not required to be changed when first used.

FREE-boxes of former customers: The controller also put FREE-boxes in circulation which contained data of previous subscribers. The DPA stated that technical and organisational measures implemented were also not sufficient here, since the controller had no 'alert procedure' to monitor the actual completion of test sequences before the distribution of the boxes to new subscribers. The lack of such a procedure could also allow unauthorised third parties, the new subscribers, to access personal data of former subscribers. These boxes were also only remotely deactivated by the controller three years after the breach was reported.

Failure to comply with the obligation to document a personal data breach (Article 33 GPDR)

The DPA also determined a violation of Article 33 GDPR. The documentation provided by the controller did not allow the DPA to assess of all the measures taken by the controller to resolve the data breach caused by the redistribution of the FREE-boxes.

"Based on a notification of a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR by Casa Rusu SRL, a controller, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. During its investigation, the DPA found that the breach was the result of insufficient security measures in the online payments section of the controller's website. The website's data bank stored the bank details of the controller's clients. By using an unauthorized entry in the website's security form, a breach occurred which gave an unauthorized party access to the personal data of the controller's clients and data subjects, namely: the first and last name of bank card holders, their card numbers, the date and year of expiry of the bank cards, and the bank card's CVC code.

The DPA's investigation showed that the controller did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures, both at the time of establishing the means of processing the personal data, and at the time of the processing itself. It also came to light that the controller did not carry out any periodic testing, evaluation, and assessment of the effectiveness of its technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of processing as required to effectively implement the principles of the GDPR.","As a consequence of the aforementioned investigation, the DPA came to the conclusion that the controller breached a number of GDPR articles.

They found a violation of Article 25 GDPR, the obligation to implement data protection by design and by default, Article 32(1)(b) GDPR, the responsibility ""to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services"", Article 32(1)(d), the obligation to implement ""a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing,"" and Article 32(b) GDPR, the responsibility to take into account ""the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.""

As such, under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the controller was ordered to take into account the risk assessment for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, to review its technical and organizational security measures, and to implement corrective measures, especially regarding the processes related to electronic communications to avoid similar future incidents of unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

"The controller ""Kaufland Romania SCS"", a chain of commercial stores, was alerted by a data subject that a security video recording, containing images of the data subject showing them in the parking lot of one of the stores owned by the controller, appeared on the web page of a local newspaper.

The controller notified the Romanian DPA of the data security breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR, prompting an investigation by the DPA.

The investigation revealed that the store manager allowed an employee access to the monitoring room, who captured, with his personal mobile phone, images of the security video recordings that were playing. The employee sent the recordings to a third party via WhatsApp. Later, the images were made public by an online publication. As a result, the image and registration number of a car were made public. Two data subjects were affected by this incident.

The DPA investigated until November 2022.","In its subsequent decision, the DPA held that the controller did not take adequate measures to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority, who has access to personal data, does not process it except at the controller's request. Consequently, the controller did not take adequate measures to continuously protect the data as would have been required by Article 29 GDPR.

Moreover, in violation of Article 32(1)(b), Article 32(2), and Article 34(4) GDPR, the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of confidentiality and security corresponding to the processing risk generated by the destruction, loss, modification, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to personal data.

Under the provisions of Article 58(2) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to apply corrective measure by implementing instructions regarding the prohibition of the use of employees' personal equipment (such as: mobile phone, tablets) to film, take photos, download or distribute security video recordings.

"A hotel company, OÜ Laidoneri KV (the controller), installed CCTV cameras visible in three external corners of its Park Hotel Viljandi, the public spaces on the ground floor as well as in the kitchen and the basement floor. The cameras monitored the employees of the hotel (data subjects).

On its own initiative, the Estonian DPA started an investigation with the aim of finding out on what legal basis and for what purpose the CCTV cameras were used. During the proceedings, the controller explained that it used consent as a legal basis through the installation of information signs on the walls of the building, notifying data subjects that surveillance camera were active.","First, the DPA recalled that according to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, personal data processing must have a valid legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR. As a general rule, the processing of personal data in an employment relationship can be lawful if it is related to the performance of a contractual obligation or a legal duty owed to the employer, or if it is in the legitimate interest of the employer or a third party. In the present case, the DPA stated that the fulfilment of contractual obligations can only be invoked for processing operations which are actually necessary for the employer to perform the employment contract, which the use of cameras certainly was not.

The DPA also rejected the argument of the controller that the processing of personal data could be based on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The investigation revealed that the signs informing about the usage of CCTV cameras were not suitable as they lacked necessary information about the aim of the video surveillance, no legal basis was mentioned, and no information was provided about the controller.

Therefore, the only possible legal basis would be legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. However, in order to invoke this legal basis, an assessment must be carried out, showing that the interest of the controller outweighs the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects. For example, cameras cannot be used because of a hypothetical threat. Additionally, according to Article 5(2) GDPR, the controller must be able to prove the lawfulness of processing.

The DPA concluded that the controller had no valid legal basis for the monitoring of its employees via CCTV cameras and ordered the controller, under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, to discontinue the use of video surveillance.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The controller is a manufacturer of heart rate monitors and smart watches offering its services in multiple Member States in the EU and wordwide. Customers (data subjects) had to register for an online service in order to use all the features of the devices, which required personal information, such as gender, height, age and weight. The device collected heart rate, max VO2 (maximum oxygen capacity) as well as BMI (body mass index) information and uploaded them to the online service. Data subjects could use the collected information to analyse training performance.

The Finnish DPA received five complaints from data subjects between 22 May 2018 and 19 February 2019.  The Austrian DPA received one complaint on the same matter. The complaints addressed fours main issues.

First, according to the complaints, the consent to process heart rate data was forced onto the data subjects as the controller made the use of the online service conditional upon granting consent to process heart rate data. If the data subject subseqently withdrew consent, their online service account would be frozen. However, according to the controller, the device was separate from the online service as some basic features were still usable without the online service.

Second, the controller also requested consent for the processing of other personal data, such as max VO2, sleep target time and daily activity target, next to information such as gender, age, height and weight. The controller argued that it was not possible to draw conclusions about a person's health based on this 'raw' data, hence there was no processing of sensitive data other than heart rate data. Allegedly, such conclusions about health would only be possible with the help of medical exminations or additional data.

Third, the complaints questioned the lawfulness of data transfers to third countries. Although the controller's servers were located in the EU, in Finland and Ireland, personal data from the controller's email service would be sent to a server located in the US. For these transfers, the controller used as a legal basis consent under Article 49(1)(a) GDPR (prior to November 2019). The controller submitted that it had asked data subjects for consent to transfer the data to the US in order to make them more aware of the processing carried out by the company.

Fourth, the data subjects noted that while accepting the terms and conditions, they also had to consent to the controller processing ""user-generated content"", that is any content uploaded or transmitted to the online service (e.g. training results) apart from the information initially provided. There was no separate consent form for the processing of user-generated content. This data would be made available globally and also transferred outside the EU. If the data subject withdrew their consent, the user-generated data would not be removed. The data subject could request their deletion only by closing their account.

Because the controller operated in multiple Member States, the cooperation mechanism under Article 60 GDPR was activated. Since the controller's main establishment was located in Finland, the Finnish DPA was the lead supervisory authority (Article 65 GDPR), while the concerned supervisory authorities (Article 4(22) GDPR) were, among others, the Austrian, Belgian, Czech and Danish DPAs. After investigating the controller's processing practices as well as receiving the submissions by the concerned supervisory authorities, the Finnish DPA issued a draft decision pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR. No objections were raised by concerned supervisory authorities, rendering it a binding decision on the controller.","With regards to processing of heart rate data, the Finnish DPA referred to an Article 29 Working Party Letter to the European Commission regarding health data. The DPA explained that although a single heart rate record might not be enough to constitute personal data, according to WP29, together with other information, such as gender, age and weight, conclusions about a person's health could be drawn. Therefore, the DPA held that the heart rate data must be considered as health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) GDPR and Article 9(1) GDPR. Processing of sensitive data requires a legal basis under Article 9(2) GDPR. In the present case, the DPA stated that since the controller processed heart rate data for the provision of a value added service, the processing must be subject to the explicit consent of the data subject (Article 9(2)(a) GDPR). However, the consent given should also meet conditions of Article 7 GDPR, meaning it cannot be conditional upon accessing a service. Hence, although not explicitly reitarrated by the DPA, the controller did not have a valid legal basis to process heart rate data.

Similarly to the heart rate data. The DPA considered other 'raw' information collected by the service, such as max VO2 and BMI to constitute health data to the extent that it can lead to conclusions about a data subject's health when combined with other personal data uploaded on the service. The DPA stipulated that the controller must collect explicit and specific consent for each purpose the personal data is processed for. The controller did not collect explicit consent for the processing of this information, thereby violating Article 9(2) GDPR.

The DPA also analysed the legal basis of the controller for personal data transfers to third countries, specifically the US. However, the DPA only took into account the controller's practices prior to November 2019, when the controller's submissions in the investigation were made. The DPA concluded that the controller did not need to collect consent under Article 49(1)(a) GDPR because, at that time, the previous adequacy decision under Article 45 GDPR, called Privacy Shield, was still in force an the controller had a valid legal basis to transfer personal data to the US. The DPA did not make any further assessments on the situation after the CJEU Schrems II judgement, which invalidated the Privacy Shield.

Concerning the consent to process 'user-generated data', the DPA held that merely accepting the terms and condititons of the online service could not be considered as consent. According to Article 7(2) GDPR, where the data subject gives consent in a written communication which also concerns other matters, the request for consent must be clearly distinguished from the other matters in an easily understandable and accessible form in clear and plain language. Moreover, in order for consent to be freely given, in line with Article 7(4) GDPR, it cannot be conditional upon the provision of a service. The DPA held the controller had not collected valid consent from the data subjects and therefore had no valid legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR.

The Finnish DPA, as lead supervisory authority, ordered the controller, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, to bring its processing activities in line with the GDPR, especially with regards to finding a valid legal basis for the processing of personal data on its online service. The DPA further reprimanded the controller, pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR, for processing max VO2 and BMI data without a legal basis. Finally, the DPA fined the controller, pursuant to Aritcles 58(2)(i) and 83 GDPR, €122,000 for the afore-discussed GDPR infringements.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 9
"Alektum Oy has declined to answer data subjects request to review their data. The company also hampered and slowed down the investigation

The case is based on three different reports made to DPA. In two cases data subject didn't receive any replies from the company and in one case data subject got a general reply but not the information requested.

In the case of one data subject, Alektum Oy explained the non-response by saying that it no longer processed personal data of the data subject. DPA stated that even then, the company should have responded to the data subject and inform that they no longer process the data subjects personal data.

In case 6707/154/2018 data subject requested to use his right to be forgotten as defined in article 17. Alektum Oy denied to remove data from their system. DPA hold that controller had right to decline the request because the data subject still had outstanding account for the controllers client and the information was still needed for the purpose it was originally collected. The controller should have inform the data subject when his data would be removed.","DPA hold that Alektum Oy has violated GDPR Article 15 Subsection 1 and 2 as well as Article 12 Subsection 3 in all three cases.

"The courier and logistics company PostNord (the controller) offers their customers a service MyPostNord, where they can schedule and track parcels as well as obtain advantages such as faster bookings. MyPostNord can also be accessed through an mobile app.

In February and March 2020, the controller submitted two data breach notifications to the Norwegian DPA, relating to cases where unauthorised persons were able to access customer profiles of others. The unauthorised persons were able to access the profiles because the controller used phone numbers as the only means of authentication. Entering someone else's number (for example an incorrect one) could give them access to other persons' personal data, including name, gender, postal address, email address, phone number, order- and payment history, shipments underway and sender name. The same happened in cases where there was a new owner of the phone number previously used in the MyPostNord service and where the pervious owner of the same phone number did not update their profile information.

In addition to the controller's breach notifications, the DPA received information from the public about similar incidents. The DPA initiated an investigation and requested information from the controller. Specifically, the DPA asked for the risk assessment of the service MyPostNord and related processing systems. The controller submitted the risk assessment, but could not state when the risk assessment was conducted.","The DPA assessed whether the controller took measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in accordance with Article 32 GDPR. One of the requirements under Article 32(1) GDPR is to identify risks associated with the processing of personal data. Controllers must perform and be able to report a risk assessment in order to sufficiently demonstrate compliance with Article 5(2) and Article 24(1) GDPR. The DPA noted that the risk assessment of the controller was not conducted before the processing began, and it lacked a systematic overview of relevant risks related to the processing of personal data, including the lack of an assessment of the risk of confidentiality breaches. The DPA recommended the controller to implement an established methodology, for example based on ISO 27001.

Further, the DPA noted that using telephone numbers as an identifier to access the MyPostNord service could pose problems with regard to the principle of confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR), especially when phone numbers are assigned to new owners but the service profiles are not updated. The DPA held that the controller violated Articles 32(1) and 32(2) GDPR for insufficient risk assessment of security measures in the MyPostNord service, and ordered the controller, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, to implement sufficient technical and organisational measures as per Article 32 GDPR.

"On an unspecified date, a logistics firm (controller) notified the Romanian DPA of two data breaches in line with Article 33 GDPR. Following the notifications, the DPA launched an investigation which concluded that the security breaches were caused by the theft of a bookshelf containing the files of 12 employees. The theft allowed unauthorised third parties access the personal data contained therein. The breach occurred on 3 June 2021 and included data concerning contact information, academic and professional training, employment details, information on tax deductions and dependents, and employees' health status. The DPA concluded the investigation in December 2022.","The DPA held that the controller did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk generated in particular by the destruction, loss, modification, unauthorised disclosure or unauthorised access to personal data. Hence, the controller violated Articles 32(1)(b) and 32(2) GDPR.

Pursuant to its Article 58(2) GDPR statutory powers, the DPA ordered the controller to implement corrective measures and to review and update the technical and organisational measures implemented as a result of the risk assessment, including the work procedures related to the protection of personal data, as well as to carry out a training for all individuals authorised to process personal data.

"Controller is a law firm whose main services consist of providing legal advice to clients injured in traffic accidents and representing them in court proceedings concerning damages. In the course of these activities, the controller interacted with potential clients (data subjects) in order to assess their legal situation as well as possibilities of taking their cases on board. Before interacting with the data subjects, the controller would verbally ask for consent to process the personal data of the data subjects. However, there was no evidence available of obtaining such a consent. Based on an oral declaration and before concluding any contract, the controller would obtain the following information from the data subjects: name, surname, telephone number, e-mail address, information about the death of another person, and health data related to traffic accidents.

In February 2022, the Polish DPA initiated ex officio proceedings in order to investigate the controller's data processing activities with regard to potential clients.","The Polish DPA noted that the processing of personal data may only take place when a valid legal basis exists in accordance with Articles 5(1)(a) and 6(1) GDPR, and in the case of health data which constitute sensitive data, also Article 9(2) GDPR. The DPA analysed whether the controller had a valid legal basis for processing. Since the offering of services to potential clients involved direct marketing and the controller failed to prove the adherence to any other valid legal basis under the GDPR, the DPA concluded that the only possibility would have been to base the processing on consent of the data subject (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) and explicit consent when dealing with sensitive data (Article 9(2)(a) GDPR). However, the controller only collected oral and unregistered consent. In this regard, the DPA recalled that Article 5(2) GDPR obliges the controller to demonstrate compliance with GDPR provisions, this includes obtaining proof of consent in line with Article 7(1) GDPR. Especially in the context of Article 9(2)(a) GDPR, the explicit consent collected for processing of health data should have a 'distinct character'. Therefore, the DPA held that the consent was invalid and the controller processed personal data without a valid legal basis.

In conclusion, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1) and 9(2) GDPR, which resulted in imposing an administrative fine of PLN 45,697 on the controller pursuant to Articles 58(2)(i) and 83 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9"
"The Church of Norway (the controller) used information about new births from the National Population Register disclosed on the basis of national law, including sensitive data. If at least one parent was an existing member of the Church, the controller was allowed to register newborns (as 'affiliated persons') in their member register and, on the same condition, they also had permission as per the national population regulations to receive automatic notifications on newborns. This permission expired on 1 October 2018, and on 1 January 2021 the other relevant regulations were replaced.

The controller, however, still continued to receive the automatic notifications until 14 November 2018. At this point, they still considered that the minors registered during the period 1 October to 14 November were correctly registered as per the (now expired) Norwegian Church law, and did not delete the data.

On 28 February 2020 the Norwegian Humanist Association and lawfirm Bull & Co lodged a complaint with the Norwegian DPA on behalf of eight data subjects, claiming that the controller had unlawfully collected information on the data subjects' newborns and failed to inform them about this processing. Consequently, the DPA launched an investigation.

Only when the controller realised that the correct end date was 1 October, it initiated an erasure process, but due to a claimed technical error, this was not carried out until 18 August 2020. The controller informed the DPA that the personal data on affiliated persons would be deleted when the legal basis for this processing expired on 1 January 2021. On 22 January 2021, it informed that the personal data of 108.880 data subjects were deleted. With regard to the alleged lack of information issue, the controller claimed that it could rely on the exemption set forth in Article 14(5)(c) GDPR and noted that it still provided some information through the main privacy notice for the Church, as well as on local websites.","The DPA held that the controller violated Article 6(1) GDPR by processing personal data on members' newborns between 1 October and 14 November 2018, and continued to store the personal data without a valid legal basis. The DPA noted that, in line with Article 17(1)(d) GDPR, the controller was obliged to delete data processed unlawfully, unless the exception of Article 17(3) GDPR (fulfillment of a task in public interest) applied. The DPA held that the controller did not full the requirements of performing a task in the public interest as the special regulations ceased to apply to the controller after 1 October 2018. Therefore, the controller had stored the data illegally before deletion in 2021. The DPA also held that the controller violated Articles 14(1)(d), 14(2)(f) and 12(1) GDPR by not providing the data subjects easily available information about the collection of automatic birth notifications from the National Population Register.

In addition, the DPA noted that the controller could not rely on the exemption in Article 14(5)(c) GDPR, because the collection of automatic birth notifications was not expressly provided by the relevant national law (the former Norwegian Church law).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 14, Article 17, Article 58"
"The data subject applied for a vacant position at the company H.M.B. EAD (controller). After signing some paperwork, the data subject and the controller agreed to another meeting in order to finalise the employment contract. On 28 April 2021, before such meeting took place, the controller sent the papers signed by the data subject to the 'National Revenue agency' (NRA).  According to Article 62(5) of the Bulgarian Labour code, an employer had to notify the NRA within three days of signing/closing the employement contract. In the end, the data subject did not complete the application procedure.

The data subject stated that she had been registered as an unemployed person on 8 February 2021 and had been granted unemployment benefits for three months. However, the benefits suddenly stopped, which is why the data subject checked with the social insurance institution for the cause of this issue. Here, she discovered that the controller had filed the signed papers as an employment contract, which had made her ineligible to receive further unemployment benefits.

The data subject filed a complaint at the Bulgarian DPA, stating that the controller unlawfully processed her data by submitting an employment contract without her knowledge. The data subject stated that she did not sign any employment contract and did not provide any personal data to the controller.

The controller stated that the allegations of the data subject were false. It stated that on 17 April 2021, the data subject had provided her CV to the controller in order to apply for a vacant job position. The controller did not deny that an employment contract had not formally been signed yet, but stated that the job-offer documents contained all the aspects of an employment contract and could therefore be regarded as such. This was also the reason why the company submitted the documents to the NRA pursuant to Article 62(5) of the Labour code. The signed documents also included a declaration of consent by the data subject to process her personal data. These documents contained several categories of personal data, such as full name, unique nationality number, address, identity card number, email, a photograph and a telephone number.

In response to these arguments, the data subject admitted that she had sent the CV and signed a consent for the processing of her data. However, she kept insisting that she did not sign any employment contract.","First, the DPA held that the data subject voluntarily disclosed her data to the controller by signing the declaration of consent for the processing of her personal data. The data subject had also started the application procedure by sending the required documentation using her personal email for the purpose of concluding the contract. In this regard, there was no breach of Articles 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(b) GDPR.

Second, the DPA determined that the documents signed by the data subject could not be seen as an employment contract. This was even admitted as such by the controller, who stated that 'no employment contract was formally signed'. The controller's argument that the job-offer documents signed by the data subject basically constituted an employment contract was unfounded. The DPA noted that the job application was only the first stage of the procedure, which ended with the signing of the employment contract. The documents also only included the signature of the data subject. The signature of the controller would have been necessary to consider the documents an employment contract. Also, the name of the controller was not even mentioned in the job-offer.

Because there was no employment contract, there was also no statutory obligation for the controller to send these documents, which contained the personal data of the data subject, to the NRA. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the personal data of the data subject had been processed without a legal basis, in violation of Article 6(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6
"The cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen (the controllers) used Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, with servers located in the US, as a tracking technology tool on their online system (https://helmet.fi) of public libraries to monitor visitors and improve the service. The controllers installed cookie tracking technologies on the data subjects' terminal devices as soon as the website was accessed, even before a cookie banner would be shown to them. Information about processing of personal data was available on the library website under the ""About the website"" link. However, this general privacy note would not inform data subjects about data transfers to the US, but only mention that ""some service providers are located outside of the EU/EEA"" without specific information on the recipients in third countries. Information about the tracking technologies was also provided under the heading ""Cookies"".

In light of the CJEU Schrems II judgement, the Finnish DPA started an ex officio investigation into the controllers' data transfers to third countries. The DPA considered four main issues: legal basis for processing of personal data collected through tracking technology tools, information given to data subjects related to the use of tracking technologies, implementation of technical and organisational measures for sharing data on search results with third parties, legal basis for data transfers to third countries.","First, with regards to the legal basis for processing personal data collected through the tracking technology, specifically Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, the DPA noted that certain cookies were set on the website before an interaction with the cookie banner. Such cookies were not strictly necessary and therefore required valid consent of the data subject. The DPA held that the controllers violated Articles 5(1)(a) and 6(1) GDPR, which require a valid legal basis for the processing of personal data. Moreover, the DPA found a violation of Article 25(1) GDPR because the controllers failed to effectively implement the principle of lawfulness under Article 5 GDPR.

Second, the DPA assessed the information provided to data subjects and recalled that information on processing should be easily accesible to data subjects. The DPA held that providing the privacy notice in a section called 'About the website' was not clear and violated the principle of transparency (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR). The DPA also noted that the controllers were obliged, under Article 13(1)(e) GDPR to inform data subjects about transfers to third countries. However, the information provided was too general and not sufficient as it did not include the third countries nor recipients with whom data outside the EU would be shared. Hence, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 13 and 25(1) GDPR.

Third, the DPA considered that using Google Analytics for the search result page could lead to a security breach in the form of sharing the data with unauthorised third parties. The DPA explained that search data on a library website can reveal a considerable amount of information about a person's private life and can be used, for example, to create a personal profile of the data subject. The negligent processing of personal data by the controllers led to the transmission of this information at least to Google. Therefore, the DPA held that the controllers violated Articles 32(1)(2) and 25 GDPR by systematically and unintentionally disclosing personal data to third parties through an 'obvious' lack of technical and organisational measures as well as a failure to implement the principle of privacy by design.

Fourth, the DPA assessed whether the controllers had a valid legal basis for transferring personal data to the US. The DPA recalled that since the Schrems II judgement, controllers could no longer rely on the Privacy Shield adequacy decision. The DPA held that the controllers breached Article 44 GDPR, which requires transfers to be carried out in accordance with the conditions of Chapter V of the GDPR, and Article 46 GDPR, which requires appropriate safeguards in the absence of a decision under Article 45 GDPR, as the controllers provided no valid legal basis for their transfers to the US.

The DPA also made a general remark on the use of tracking technologies by public authorities. It held that the controllers should carefully consider what kind of tracking technology is actually necessary on their website and whether, for example, the online service could be provided entirely without tracking technologies other than those necessary for the functioning of the website. The controllers should have a legal basis for their processing activites and adequately inform data subjects of the purposes of processing.

In conclusion, based on Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controllers to bring their processing activities in line with the GDPR, including the deletion of all data collected with Google Analytics and Tag Manager, as well as updating information provided to data subjects. The DPA issued reprimands, under Article 58(2)(b) GDPR, to the controllers for violating the above-mentioned provisions of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32, Article 44, Article 46, Article 13"
"M&M Inkasso OÜ (the controller) was a debt collection company, which published information about debtors (data subjects), including names and photographs, on its website and social media (Facebook, Instagram and TikTok) as a form of retaliation.

After receiving a tip from the public about the social media activities of the controller, the Estonian DPA started an ex officio investigation. During the proceedings, the controller explained that the publication was justified by ""vital interests"". Specifically, the posted content was supposed to prevent malicious exploitation of those who could get in contact with debtors. The controller also submitted that it had taken into consideration all other necessary legal considerations with a view to avoiding legal infringements and all information published on the company's website and social media was taken from the Internet and freely available.","In its decision, the DPA assessed whether the controller had a valid legal basis to publish debt default data of the data subjects on social media.

Firstly, the DPA referred to Recital 46 GDPR and Article 6(1)(d) GDPR, under which processing of personal data is lawful when it is necessary to protect the ""vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person"". However, the DPA noted that for the protection of vital interests of another natural person (who is not the data subject), this legal basis should only be used when no other, more suitable, legal basis exists. The DPA held that in the case of payment defaults, the creditor must first and foremost use the legal remedies listed in §101 of the Estonian Law of Obligations Act to obtain payment of the debt. According to the DPA, it was illegal to disclose individuals' payment default data solely as a means of retaliation. Therefore, the social media publications by the controller could not be considered as protecting the vital interest of creditors or other natural persons.

Second, the DPA assessed whether the controller had a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to post the debt default data on social media. This legal basis would have required an assessment by the controller of the balance between its legitimate interest in informing the public about the debts of the data subjects and the data subjects' right to data protection. However, the controller had not submitted such an assessment to the DPA, making this legal basis not applicable.

Third, the DPA noted under §4 of the Estonian Personal Data Protection Act, personal data can be disclosed for journalistic purposes if three conditions are met: there is a public interest in the disclosure of personal data, the disclosure is in line with journalistic ethics rules, and the disclosure does not prejudice data subject rights. In view of the DPA, the public interest criterion was not met since the disclosure of personal data would have to contribute to the further development of a democratic society. The indebtness of data subjects did not fall within the interest of the public. Since the criteria were cumulative, the DPA did not discuss the further elements.

The DPA concluded that the controller processed personal data without a legal basis. Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to stop publishing posts containing personal data on its social media. In case the controller does not comply with the order within the prescribed time limit, the DPA would impose a €1,000 fine as a penalty payment.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6
"Following a report received from the police on 15 July 2020, the Italian DPA sent two requests for information to the owner of Naija Market International, the controller, a company engaged in the grocery business in Modena. These requests sought further information regarding the installation of a video surveillance system on store premises. After the controller did not comply with the requests, the Italian DPA carried out an inspection at the controller's two operating sites, which revealed the presence of video surveillance cameras filming interior spaces of the establishments and therefore potentially suitable for monitoring the work activities of the controller's employees. The cameras were operating in the absence of the appropriate information signs, an alleged violation the Article 5(1)(a) GDPR principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and the transparency obligations in Article 13 GDPR. Furthermore, the surveillance system was installed without first obtaining permission from the territorially competent Labour Department, in violation of Italian Law.

Responding to the allegations, the controller claimed to be unaware of the obligation to inform the Labour department and, because they are a foreign national, unable to understand the particularly technical data protection regulation. Moreover, the controller argued that the conduct involved only 3 employees, and therefore this was only a minor violation.","The Italian DPA did not accept the controller's submissions, and held that the use of the video surveillance system constituted a processing of personal data which had to be carried out in accordance with the general principles contained in Article 5 GDPR, in particular the principle of transparency. In this case, the processing had not been signalled in any way and the controller failed to provide any information notice to its employees. According to the Italian DPA, the controller therefore violated Article 5(1)(a) and 13 GDPR.

In addition, the Italian DPA held that the processing had also been carried out in violation of Article 114 of Legislative Decree No. 196/2003 (the Privacy Code). Article 114 Privacy Code introduces a special regime regarding the processing of employees' personal data, in line with the provisions of Article 88 GDPR; which allows for Member States to provide more specific rules to ensure the protection of data subject rights and freedoms in this context. Article 114 Privacy Code stipulates that in the case of processing that can result in remote monitoring of workers it is necessary to comply with Article 4, Law No. 300/1970 (Statute of Workers). Article 4 Statute of Workers stipulates that in such cases, video surveillance equipment can be used after entering into a collective agreement with the trade union representation or, where this is not possible, after obtaining prior authorisation from the competent work council. Given that the installation of the video surveillance system had not been previously authorised by the work council, the processing violated Article 114 Privacy Code.

Lastly, by failing to reply to the Italian DPA's request within the prescribed time limit, the controller also breached the obligation to provide the information requested by the DPA under Article 157 Privacy Code.

Therefore, the Italian DPA held that the controller had violated Articles 5(1)(a) and 13 GDPR, in addition to Articles 114 and 157 of the Privacy Code. Pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) GDPR and 83 GDPR, the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €6,000.00, and an order to affix the required information signs, to obtain to required permission from the Labour Department, and communicate the steps taken in this respect within 90 days from the date of notification of the order.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 58"
"On 21 September 2021, the data subject opened a bank account, which he closed again less than two months after, on 5 November 2021. On the same day, he also requested the deletion of his data. According to the data subject, this request was denied on 19 November 2021. On 7 December 2021, the data subject received an offer from the controller by e-mail for a consumer loan, despite the fact he was no longer a customer of the controller and did not use any of its services anymore. The data subject submitted a complaint at the Bulgarian DPA (DPA) because of the unlawful processing of his personal data for direct marketing purposes.

During the proceedings, the controller confirmed that the marketing e-mail was sent but stated that this had been the result of an error, caused by an additional safety mechanism implemented by the controller. This mechanism was designed for customers who closed their accounts unusually quickly, which was in less than three months. The controller had to retain certain information of former clients in order to comply with the national Anti-Money Laundering Act. Since the data subject had only been a client for less than two months, his data was kept but subsequently included in the list for direct marketing e-mails. The controller emphasised that a minimal amount of personal data was processed as a result of this error (first name and e-mail address) and that the data subject had not been profiled.

The controller also explained that for its commercial campaigns, it had several criteria to exclude e-mail addresses from its mailing list. The first criterion was to determine whether the status of the customer was 'active' or 'inactive'. If the status was 'inactive', the e-mail address belonged to a former customer and would not be included in the list. The second criterion was when a data subject had refused to receive direct marketing from the controller. In that case, the respective e-mail address would also not be included in the mailing list.

Because of the safety mechanism, the status of the data subject was still 'active' despite the fact he was no longer a customer of the controller. Because he also did not object to personalised marketing when he had opened his bank account, his e-mail address was included in the mailing list.","The Bulgarian DPA held that the data subject's e-mail address should have not been on the list for the marketing campaign in the first place, because the data subject had already terminated his contract with the bank. The DPA stated that the controller did not have a basis for processing the data subject's personal data for the purpose of this specific marketing campaign, especially because the data subject did not even meet the criteria explicitly set by the controller to be included in the mailing list.

The fact that the data subject was wrongfully included in this list was caused by the additional safety mechanism to comply with national anti-money laundering purposes. The measures of the controller were therefore not appropriate and/or capable of ensuring and demonstrating that processing was carried out in compliance with the GDPR. Therefore, the DPA determined that the controller violated Article 24(1) GDPR by using this safety mechanism. The DPA also stated that the safety mechanism was inappropriate looking at the GDPR, because personal data of customers was processed regardless of the duration of the contractual relationship with the bank.

The DPA warned the controller pursuant of Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 24
"The controller is a news service provider. Data subjects subscribed to its service to receive daily news and updates through a newsletter. It was not clarified whether this was a paid service. The controller relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the data for the newsletter.

The controller also processed personal data for electronic direct marketing (eDM) and a prize draw. The eDM emails were sent to everyone who subscribed to the service. The prize draw was advertised by the controller in the period between 24 February 2022 to 24 March 2022. The controller wanted to offer the prize draw's prize to all service subscribers. Therefore, all the service users were subscribed to the prize draw and there was no way for them to opt out of the prize draw.

On 24 June 2022, the DPA opened an ex officio investigation into a controller's services. According to the facts uncovered by the DPA, between January 1, 2021 and May 17, 2022, all subscribers who registered online for the news service were automatically subscribed to eDM. A single checkbox on the website was used to accept the Terms of Service (TOS) - a condition of the subscription - and to subscribe to eDM. At the time of subscription. In other words, it was not possible to subscribe to the service through the website alone without subscribing to eDM. In its defense, the controller argued that the data processing could be legitimized through legitimate interests.","The DPA decided that the controller's conduct was in breach of the GDPR.

First, the DPA rejected the controller's argument that, in the absence of other suitable legal grounds, the processing may have been done on the legal basis of legitimate interest. The DPA emphasized that controllers are obliged to decide in advance on the legal basis for processing, to weigh the legitimate interest against the rights of the data subject pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, to document this, and to inform the data subjects accordingly, including about the right to object. In the absence of this, an ex-post change of the legal basis would generally, as well as in the present case, constitute an unfair processing for the data subjects, and the balancing of interests would not lead to a positive result for the controller. As a matter of principle, the DPA stated that it is not up to the data subject or the DPA to identify the appropriate legal basis before the processing starts. Rather, by virtue of the principle of privacy by design and by default, it is the sole responsibility of the controller.

Second, the DPA held that the controller did not sufficiently inform data subjects about their rights. It emphasized that, under Article 12(1) GDPR, a controller must provide the data subject with the necessary assistance to enable him or her to exercise all data subject rights in an informed manner. The information obligation is not a mere ""paperwork"" obligation, but is intended to enable the data subject to make an informed choice about the processing and to exercise his or her data subject rights. In order to be capable to fully exercise their rights (such as their right to withdraw consent), it is necessary to know exactly when and under what conditions data processing based on the data subject's consent for the purpose of eDM will cease. Such information was not provided. The duration for which personal data would be processed for eDM was not sufficiently clear and unambiguous. Therefore the DPA found the controller in breach of Article 12(1) GDPR.

Third, the DPA decided that the data processing was not based on consent, as the controller did not fulfil the conditions of Article 7 GDPR. Consent was neither sufficiently informed. Referring to the European Data Protection Board's Guideline 5/2020, the DPA explained that any information that may be relevant to a typical data subject's decision must be provided. According to the DPA this includes the duration of processing in the case of eDM. Data subjects typically subscribe to a large number of newsletters over the course of their lives, which are difficult for them to keep track of. Therefore, the DPA was of the opinion that the time of the cessation of e-mailing in the case of eDM is important information for data subjects. Moreover, according to Article 7(2) and 7(4) GDPR, consent must be granular. To use consent as a legal basis, controller must not bundle different incompatible processing purposes. This was violated in the present case. Consent would have to be given separately for the subscription service, the eDM, and the prize draw. The investigation of the DPA showed that the controller had not complied with these criteria.

Consequently, the DPA found the data processing to be unlawful. The processing violated  Article 7(2) GDPR, Article 7(4) GDPR and Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The controller was fined 2,000,000 HUF (approx. €5,080). In determining the height of the fine, the DPA took into account some mitigating circumstances, namely, that the controller cooperated with the DPA during the proceedings, acknowledged the infringement and remedied it for the future in the present proceedings, conducted internal training, and that the infringement only concerned the data subjects' email address data and not any other data or sensitive data. An aggravating circumstance was that the data processing continued for an extended period of time.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 7, Article 12"
"On April 2020 an early childhood education unit (pre-school) sent an inquiry along with an informational letter regarding activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The families were asked to return the form, providing personal data (including the child's social security number) and stating whether they could arrange childcare at home during the pandemic.

A letter accompanying the inquiry form stated that handling personal data is based on consent and that the data subject gives consent by returning the form. In reality many parents were told that returning the questionnaire was mandatory.

The controller responded to the DPA's request for information, stating that returning the inquiry form was voluntary but strongly desirable. The information was needed to arrange activities during exceptional circumstances due to the COVID pandemic. The controller agreed that the voluntary nature of the inquiry could have been more clearly communicated. They also explained that employees had been given general guidelines for handling personal data, but not specific guidelines for this particular situation.

The controller identified Article 6(1)(c) GDPR (necessary for compliance with a legal obligation) as the legal basis for the processing of personal data in this case. Their statement asserted that they needed the information in order to arrange day care for children, accounting for the number of students learning from home, and to arrange lessons in small groups where possible. They also claimed that they required the information in order to refund families if a child was not attending the activities due to the pandemic. However, the controller agreed that a child's social security number was not a necessary piece of information, and that their age would have been enough to verify the identity of the child.","The DPA considered whether data subjects were informed in the survery of the purpose and legal basis of the processing of personal data, and the voluntariness of responding to the inquiry. This decision was based on Article 5(1)(a) GDPR (principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency); Article 12(1) GDPR (controller's responsibility to communicate in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language); and Article 13 GDPR (detailing the information to be provided to the data subject).

The DPA evaluated the inquiry form used by the controller and found that it was unclear whether returning was voluntary or mandatory. Furthermore, neither the form nor the accompanying information sheet sufficiently clarified how the data would be used. No information was provided to explain that the collection of the personal data was needed to identify how many children required day care, and the information did not clarify whether day care could be denied based on the answers provided. In its response to the investigation, the controller had stated that the information was required in order to process refunds if children were not attending day care. However, it was not clear whether the personal data would be processed to determine the arrangement of child care at home, the processing of payment refunds, or both.

Taking into account the above-mentioned points, the DPA found that the purpose of personal data processing had not been sufficiently communicated, and that the controller had therefore infringed their transparency obligations under Articles 5(1)(a), 12, and 13 GDPR. Accordingly, the controller was reprimanded pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13"
"The controller is Luka Inc, a US-based company that developed and operated Replika, an AI-powered chatbot.

According to the controller, Replika can improve the user's mood and emotional well-being by helping them understand their thoughts and feelings, keep track of their mood, learn coping skills (i.e., stress control), calm anxiety, and work towards goals such as positive thinking, stress management, socialising, and finding love. In other words, Replika provides a kind of 'virtual friend' that users can configure as friend, partner or mentor.

Various reports were published in Italian media concerning inappropriate content on the Replika app, which would pose concrete risks particularly to minors and emotionally vulnerable people. Subsequently, the Italian DPA conducted an investigation focusing on the collection of personal data and the app’s age verification mechanisms.

The investigation revealed that, regardless of what the company stated in its privacy policy or terms of service, no age verification procedure was in place when users created an account. Moreover, the controller had not implemented any blocking method for users who could be believed to be underage during the use of Replika, for example based on the content of their responses.

The investigation also showed that the privacy policy failed to disclose information on the key elements of the processing, in particular the legal grounds and the use of children’s personal data.","The DPA held that the legal basis for the processing activities could hardly be determined from the controller's privacy policy.

In doing so, the DPA also ruled out any legal grounds under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (contractual necessity). Children, the DPA argued, are legally incapacitated to enter contracts under Italian law, especially when performance of such contracts implies making available a substantial amount of personal data, as in this case.  Hence, the DPA ruled that the processing of personal data, in particular of children was in breach of Article 5, Article 6, Article 8, Article 9, and Article 25 GDPR.

Consequently, the DPA urgently imposed upon the controller a temporary limitation on the processing of personal data relating to all users in Italy under Article 58(2)(f) GDPR. The limitation concerns all users, taking into account that there is no age verification mechanism in the app. The DPA stated that, pursuant to Article 58(1) GDPR, the controller can provide information on the steps it may take to comply with the measures within 20 days and that a fine can be imposed in case of failure to comply.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 8, Article 9, Article 13, Article 58"
"Based on a data subject's complaint, the Romanian DPA started investigations into a dental practice and a collaborating dentist (the controllers). The data subject had alleged that they had disclosed his health data online without his consent.

During the investigations the DPA was able to confirm the data subject's allegations. It found that the controllers disclosed medical information concerning the data subject's orthodontic treatment, consisting of a set of photographs and radiographs that could be correlated with the person's name, by in a published article on a specialized blog. The personal data had been  published for scientific and commercial purposes.

In contradiction to Article 33 GDPR, despite the fact that the dental practice was informed by the data subject about the unauthorized disclosure of his personal health data, the controller did not notify DPA within 72 hours of the security breach.

At the same time, the DPA found that the collaborating dentist published personal data regarding the state of health of the data subject in an article posted in a personal blog, without obtaining the express consent of to the data subject and without informing the data subject.","The DPA held that both controller's violated the GDPR.

The dental practise violated the GDPR by not informing the DPA of the data breach within 72 hours and, thereby, violated Article 33 GDPR.

The dentist who was collaborating with the dental practise, violated Articles 6(1), and 9(2)(a) GDPR by publishing the data subject's health data without consent. Moreover, by failing to inform the data subject about the publication the dentist also violated Articles 12, 13, and 14 GDPR.

The DPA fined each of them respectively 4,919 lei (approx. €1000). Additionally, both controllers were ordered to implement corrective measures to come into compliance with the GDPR.

The dental practice applied the corrective measure by implementing technical and organizational security measures appropriate to the specifics of the processing and identified risks and training authorized persons and other persons who process data under its authority.

The dentist implemented corrective measures by ensuring that the processing of patients' personal data is conducted in strict compliance with the legal provisions regarding the laws on medical services and data protection. Additionally, in the case of the use of patient's personal data for other purposes, the dentist would comply with all the legal conditions on processing personal data. Depending on the purposes of the processing and the categories of hte processed personal data, the dentist was ordered to apply the necessary measures and anonymization or pseudonymization data, where appropriate.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9, Article 33"
"The TV2 Media Group Ltd., the controller, is one of Hungary's largest content providers. It operates several TV channels and online streaming services and has two websites tv2play.hu and tenyek.hu. ""Tenyek.hu"" contains predominantly news content, while ""tv2play.hu"" focuses on various audiovisual media content. In 2021, they had between 1.6 million and 2.4 million monthly visitors and a net revenue of  49,000,000,000 HUF (approx. €127,000,000).

Based on a ""public interest notification"" the Hungarian DPA started an ex officio investigation into the data processing of the websites. There was a concern that the controller did not provide data subjects with adequate information about the processing and that the consent management platform (CMP) on the websites did not collect the consent of data subjects in a transparent and clear manner.

The investigation revealed a number of potential data protection deficits.

The CMP of the controller offered data subject's with the possibility to give consent to cookies by clicking an ""OK, continue"" button. However, the only alternative was a ""more options"" button which redirected to a second level of the CMP with more information and more detailed consent options. On this second level of the CMP, users were provided with two tabs for different categories of processing. On one tab, the user was able to give ""consent"" to different processing purposes. The other tab was titled ""legitimate interest"" and allowed the data subjects to object to data processing. Confusingly, the processes listed in both tabs was almost completely identical. They included purposes such as ""selection of basic ads"", ""Measuring ad performance"", and ""creating a personalized advertising profile"". The processing purposes """"storing and/or accessing information stored on the device"""" was only listed under the consent tab.

Regarding the meaning of ""legitimate interest"" the controller explained that, the way in which it is used on the website, the term would not relate to the legal basis under the GDPR but was meant as a ""category"". Consequently, the controller also had made no interest assessment.

Lastly, it was unclear to the DPA how consent could be withdrawn, once it had been given.","The DPA decided that the controller's conduct was in breach of the GDPR.

First, the DPA concluded that the content provider is the controller, which is ultimately responsible for the processing of the personal data.

The content provider used the websites to distribute its media content for its business interests. No other party had the right to decide whether the content provider should distribute its media content through the websites or whether it should cease to do so, and whether and through which service provider advertising should be displayed. The content provider operated the websites at its own discretion and in its commercial interest.

For all the processing examined in relation to the websites, the content provider determined the purposes and means of the processing and enabled third parties to place content on the websites. The DPA therefore held that the content provider was the controller pursuant to Article 4(7) GDPR.

Second, the DPA held that the controller violated the principle of fairness and transparency pursuant to Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1), and Article 13 GDPR by not appropriately informing the data subjects about the legal basis of the processing.

The DPA pointed out that Article 12(1) GDPR required controllers to take appropriate measures to provide data subjects with all the information referred to in Article 13 to 14 GDPR, in Article 15 GDPR to Article 22 GDPR, and in Article 34 GDPR. The information has to be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible manner and an easily accessible form, in clear and plain language. Moreover, Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires, among other things, that the controller informs its data subjects about the correct legal basis for their processing.

However, in the present case, the controller indicated ""consent"" as a legal basis for browsing-related processing, irrespective of the fact that without certain technical cookies the websites cannot function. The purpose “To store and/or access information stored on the device” was only based on consent instead of legitimate interest. However, the DPA argued that without these cookies the websites would not be able to work. Consequently, the legal basis for consent is not appropriate, as a successful website visit of a data subject means that information on the data subject's terminal were written and read regardless of consent, and could not be opted out or withdrawn.

In addition, the term “legitimate interest” used by the controller is equivalent to the term used in the GDPR under Article 6(1)(f). Therefore, since the controller explained that its ""legitimate interest"" would not refer to the ""GDPR legitimate interest"", it was either used incorrectly by the controller – and misleading – or used correctly, but without any information and without any consideration of the interests involved. Either way, the DPA considered it unfair and opaque contrary to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to indicate substantially the same purposes on both the consent and the legitimate interest tabs. It gives data subjects the impression that the same processing is possible even if consent is not given. Moreover, the information on the second level of the CMP was provided in an exceptionally long text on data management and was only available in an unreasonably small area of the screen, readable only a few lines at a time. The long text cannot be described as concise or clear.

As a result of the above, the DPA concluded that the controller violated the principle of fair and transparent processing pursuant to Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) GDPR and Article 13 GDPR.

Third, the DPA held that the controller processed personal data without a legal basis as it neither fulfilled the conditions for Article 6(1)(a) GDPR ""consent"" nor Article 6(1)(f) ""legitimate interest"".

The DPA decided that consent could not be used as a legal basis. It noted that it was not as easy to withdraw consent as it was to give it. The CMP did not provide an easily accessible possibility, neither for personal data directly processed by the controller nor for personal data transferred to third parties. There was no information provided on how to easily withdraw consent. Moreover, in addition, due to the opaqueness of the processing and the lack of clear information, as described above, consent, as a general rule, could not be considered to be a valid legal basis as it could not have been informed.

Next, the controller could also not rely on legitimate interest for its processing. During the investigation, it became clear that the controller had not clearly indicated which processes were to be based on legitimate interest and which not. However, the DPA asserted that it is not the task and responsibility of the data subject, nor of the DPA, rather than that of the controller, to identify, describe and justify the specific purposes and legal grounds for the processing. Controllers are required to clearly justify, consider and provide safeguards for the purposes and legal basis on which they intend to process which personal data. These safeguards should ensure, among other things, that the data subject is aware of the processing and can object to it before the processing takes place.

For the above reasons, the DPA concluded that the controller infringed  Article 6(1) GDPR.

In sum, the DPA found the controller to be in violation of the GDPR, specifically Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, Article 12(1) GDPR and Article 13 GDPR. It fined the controller 10,000,000 HUF (approx. €25,650). In determining the height of the fine, the DPA took into account some mitigating circumstances, namely, that the DPA had not previously found a data protection breach against the controller. Aggravating circumstances were that millions of data subjects were affected and that the processing was done for profiling purposes with commercial intent.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13"
"The company SATS ASA (the controller) is a provider of fitness and training services. It has its headquarters in Norway and is also active in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The company has over 270 clubs, about 9,000 employees and more than 700,000 members.

According to one of these members (data subject 1), the controller had transferred their personal data to other companies within its corporate group in May 2018. The controller had also transferred data to Facebook, which was located outside the EU/EEA, without a proper legal ground. This data subject further claimed that an access request, submitted on 29 August 2018, had remained unanswered. Data subject 1 filed a complaint at the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) on 2 October 2018.

Another member (data subject 2), who had already terminated their membership, claimed that the controller had not responded to an access request (Article 15 GDPR), which was submitted on 25 February 2019. The controller had also refused to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR) submitted on the same date. Data subject 2 filed a complaint at the DPA on 1 March 2019.

Another member (data subject 3), who had also terminated their membership, claimed that the controller had refused to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR), which was submitted on 05 October 2019. Data subject 3 filed a complaint at the DPA on 07 October 2019.

On 7 September 2021 and 5 October 2021, the DPA formally approached the controller and asked the company to express its views on the issues raised in Complaint No 2 and Complaint No 3. The controller replied on 1 December 2021.

On 8 December 2021, the DPA received yet another complaint from a member (data subject 4) concerning the controller’s refusal to comply with an erasure request (Article 17 GDPR), submitted on 6 August 2021.

On 23 March 2022, the DPA sent further questions to the controller on all of the above complaints and received the controller’s response on 28 April 2022.

Despite receiving the complaints over a fairly long time period, the DPA decided to handle the complaints jointly, considering the fact that all of them concerned similar alleged infringements. Another reason the DPA opted to handle the complaints jointly was 'procedural efficiency'.

On 26 September 2022, after their investigation, the DPA sent the controller an advance notification of their intention to issue an administrative fine of NOK10,000,000 (ten million) (Around €916,000) for violating several GDPR provisions.

The controller responded to the DPA on 31 October 2022 and argued, among other things, that It was ""arbitrary from the part of Datatilsynet (DPA) to [find] a violation of Article 12(3) GDPR and Article 15 GDPR due to a failure to respond to an access request that was submitted around a month after the GDPR became applicable in Norway, as at that time many companies experienced challenges in applying the new rules"".

The controller also stated that the DPA's conclusion that the controller violated both Article 12(3) GDPR and Article 15 GDPR would violate the principle of ne bis in idem.

The controller also argued that the assessment of the necessity of a storage period is to a large extent discretionary, noting that the DPA was not in the position to do this and should refrain from questioning the assessment made by the controller. The controller made the same statement concerning the choice of legal bases.

Despite the controller's arguments, the DPA submitted a draft decision on 30 December 2022 to the other supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, which was in line with the above advance notification. The DPA did not receive any relevant and reasoned objections and, consequently, upheld their advance notification.","The DPA assessed the different arguments made by the controller. The DPA first assessed the argument that the DPA's decision was arbitrary, given the fact that the GDPR had only been applicable for one month, and that many companies had difficulties applying the law. The DPA found this argument of the controller untenable, because other companies' non-compliance was not a valid justification for a violation of the GDPR that started to occur in September 2018. Further, one of the violations was still ongoing (as per February 2023).

The DPA also considered the controller's ne bis in idem argument. The DPA rejected this argument, recalling that ""the principle ne bis in idem [...] do[es] not apply to a situation in which several penalties are imposed in a single decision, even if those penalties are imposed for the same actions. In fact, where the same conduct infringes several provisions punishable by fines, the question whether several fines may be imposed in a single decision falls not within the scope of the principle ne bis in idem”.""

Lastly, the DPA considered the controller's argument that the assessment of the storage period and the choice of legal bases were to a large extent discretionary. The DPA rejected this argument on both accounts, noting that the DPA was competent to review assessments made by a controller to ensure compliance with their obligations.

Pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) GDPR, the DPA issued an administrative fine of NOK 10,000,000 (ten million) (Around €916,000) against SATS ASA for the following violations:

First, the controller violated Articles 12(3) and 15 GDPR by failing to timely act upon two separate access requests.

Second, the controller violated Articles 5(1)(e), ⁣12(3) and 17 GDPR by failing to take prompt action and erase certain personal data without undue delay pursuant to three separate erasure requests.

Third,  the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13 GDPR by failing to duly inform data subjects about its data retention policy concerning the personal data of banned members, and the relevant legal basis for the processing.

Fourth, the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) GDPR, ⁣by failing to rely on a valid lawful basis to process the training history data of the members of its fitness centres.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 15, Article 17, Article 58, Article 60"
"On 14 February 2019, the Luxembourg DPA decided to open an investigation into the companies of Group A and particularly into Company A, a bank institution (controller). The purpose of this investigation was to verify the compliance with the GDPR of the controller's video surveillance and company's cars geolocation systems.

Surveillance cameras

The investigation showed that surveillance cameras were indeed in place. Cameras’ fields of view included safe rooms, meeting rooms, the reception desk, the cash desk, offices, a computer room and a room where employees take breaks. The head of the investigation considered this to be permanent surveillance of employees at their workplace, which could create psychological pressure. He described the surveillance as “disproportionate to the purpose” and an “excessive intrusion into the employees’ private sphere”. He added that employees had no way of escaping the surveillance.

After receiving the minutes of this visit, the Company wrote a letter in which it explained that distinction should be made between two types of locations filmed, depending on their economic and strategic sensitivity: the counters and the safe room on one hand, and other locations on the other. It also considered that employees were not filmed permanently since they could avoid the cameras' field of vision. The company also argued that the presence of certain cameras was justified in relation to the purpose.

For example, a camera positioned in the safe where one of the employees was stationed and where the company kept precious metals and physical securities. The company stressed that the room is locked for security reasons and that the camera made it possible to see if the employee was ""feeling unwell"". The company also explained that this is an ad hoc workstation, subject to patrols, which means that the employee working there was not filmed at all times.

Another example was given by the cameras placed upon the counters. The company explained that employees were only filmed from behind and that their hands, faces, private or professional equipment were not targeted. According to the company, the presence of these cameras was therefore necessary and proportionate to the aims pursued.

Finally, with regard to the surveillance of the public highway, the investigation showed, among other things, that buildings not belonging to the company were filmed. The company argued that this was necessary to effectively protect their building. The head of the investigation however considered this surveillance to be disproportionate.

Information on surveillance cameras

The investigation showed that data subjects were informed about the use of surveillance cameras by a pictogram and an old CNPD authorisation sticker at the entrance door and at a passageway closed to the public. According to the head of the investigation, this information was incomplete because it did not provide, among other things, the following elements: the retention period, the purposes of the processing, the right to rectification and erasure. The GDPR intranet section did not contain sufficient information either.

In its letter in response to the minutes of the visit, the company explained that the pictograms were the first step of a various steps information which included the GDPR intranet section and mandatory trainings on data privacy. The company also reported that it had initiated the replacement of the pictograms and would indicate the missing information in the future.

With regard to third parties, the agents noted that a sign was installed containing a camera image and the words ""locals under video surveillance"".) The company considered that informing third parties was not an absolute obligation under Article 13 (which states that it is not required when communication is impossible or would require disproportionate effort).

Geo-location system on company's cars

The investigation did not demonstrate the existence of such geo-location systems.","The DPA generally agreed with the opinion of the head of the investigation. It considered firstly that for some cameras, the field of view was not limited to what was necessary to achieve the purpose of the processing, which was violating Article 5(1)(c), i.e. the principle of data minimisation. This was the case for example for cameras filming public area.

Secondly, the DPA found a failure to comply with Article 13, which imposes an obligation to provide information. It considered that multi-level information is not excluded. As regards employees, it held that the first level of information (warning sign) should include the most essential information such as identity of the controller, the purposes of processing and a reference to more detailed information (e.g. via a QR code). As for the third parties (customers, service providers, etc.), the DPA considered the same : first level of information (warning sign) should also include the most essential elements of the processing operation and a reference to the second level of information. In this case, the sign didn't include essential information nor a reference to a second level of information. The DPA underlined the fact that Article 13 requires information to be given at the time the data is obtained, which does not imply that a document must be hand-delivered to all third parties but that a reference to detailed information must be indicated on the signs.

Considering the violations of Article 5(1)(c) and Article 13, the Luxembourg DPA therefore imposed a fine of €10,000 in accordance with Article 83(2).

Taking into account the measures already taken by Company A, the DPA also ordered corrective measures: in particular 1) to stop filming the employees' workplans and, if this cannot be avoided at all, to arrange for their faces to be blurred, and 2) to obscure the public area within the cameras' field of vision. Another measure is the obligation to have a single place where all the information required by Article 13 is available.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13"
"The controller is Company A which was acting as building manager of a residence co-ownership. The data subjects are  Mr A and Mr B, some of the co-owners.

On 11 February 2019, the controller sent two emails to the other co-owners. The communication contained, among other things, the following data: the accounting situation of Mr. A and Mr. B vis-à-vis the co-ownership and their private addresses. They were intended to highlight the payment irregularities concerning the two.

The data subjects informed the controller that the disclosure amounted to a data breach and encouraged him to report it within 72 hours. They also requested access to their data and information on the processing operations. The company responded more than a month after these letters, without providing the requested information.

The data subject filed a complaint. On 4 October 2019, the Luxembourg DPA opened an investigation.

In his defense, the controller explained that under applicable national law, as a building manager, it was the cashier and accountant of the co-ownership and, as such, under the co-owners' supervision. For the co-owner to do so, it was crucial to disclose the debtors details. He therefore considered that it had to comply with a legal obligation and that the processing was therefore lawful under Article 6(1)(c). The controller also invoked Article 6(1)(f), explaining that it had a legitimate interest to the processing because it would be liable if it did not recover the debts of the co-ownership.","In substantial agreement with the head of the investigation, the DPA considered that the accounting obligations to which the controller was subject did not authorise him to communicate and transmit the accounting situation of one of the co-owners to the others. The considered processing was therefore in breach of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR. The DPA also ruled out Article 6(1)(f) on the grounds of domestic law: the building manager must indeed collect the debts but could take legal action to do so. There was therefore no legitimate interest in disclosing the data to other co-owners.

Finally, with regard to the access request, the DPA considered that the controller did not respond to the access requests within the time limit set out in Article 12(3) nor did he provide information about his inaction, as he should have done under Article 12(4). The DPA also agrees with the opinion of the Head of the investigation regarding the violation of Article 15(1)(b) and (c).

In accordance with Article 58(2) and Article 83(2), the DPA fined Company A €1,500. Since the company was no longer mandated to act as building manager at the time of the decision, the DPA did not take any corrective measures.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 58, Article 83"
"The concerned controller was an optician and merchant for glasses, sunglasses as well as contact lenses. As part of its business, the controller sent out commercial messages through its newsletter service.

The concerned data subject was one of the newsletter's recipients. Although its is not directly stated in the case, it is strongly suggested that the controller processed the data subject's data based on legitimate interest. The data subject objected to the processing, as foreseen by Article 21 GDPR, by clicking the unsubscribe button in the newsletter. Yet, the controller continued to send commercial communication to the data subject's email address in a frequent manner. Consequently, the data subject sent a complaint to the Romanian DPA, prompting the DPA to investigate the matter. The investigation confirmed the data subject's assertions.","The DPA held that the controller's conduct was a violation of the GDPR. Pursuant to Article 21 GDPR - the right to object - data subjects have the right to object to processing which is done based either the legal basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR - public interest - or the legal basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR - legitimate interest. Moreover, Article 21(3) GDPR specifically grants data subjects the right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes.

Considering the facts above, the DPA decided that the controller violated Article 21(3) GDPR by not respecting the data subject's objection. Based on its powers pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) GDPR, the DPA fined the controller €1,000 (RON 4,927.3).

"Virtue Integrated Elder Care Ltd (""VIEC""), the controller, operates and manages five nursing homes in Dublin, Ireland. On 15 August 2020, VIEC became aware through a report to their IT helpdesk that one of the users of their internal systems was being blocked from sending emails. The controller subsequently discovered that the email address of one of its managers had been subject to a phishing attack, and that emails had been rerouted to a third party Gmail account.

On 19 August 2019, VIEC notified the Irish DPA (the DPC) of a personal data breach. Based on initial analysis of the breach notification and subsequent documentation provided during the breach handling process, the DPC considered that the matter concerned a possible “breach of security potentially leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed” by VIEC. As a result, the DPC commenced an investigation.

In a commencement letter, the DPC informed VIEC that their inquiry would examine whether or not the company discharged its obligations in connection with the subject matter of the personal data breach and determine whether or not any provision(s) of data protection law had been violated by VIEC in that context.

The scope of the inquiry was stated to include the following. Firstly, the steps taken by VIEC to comply with the principle of integrity and confidentiality pursuant to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. Secondly, the technical and organisational measures taken to ensure security of processing pursuant to Article 32(1) GDPR. Thirdly, the ability of the controller to demonstrate ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability of personal data pursuant to Article 32(1)(b) GDPR. Fourth, the process employed by VIEC for regularly testing the effectiveness of measures for ensuring appropriate security pursuant to Article 32(1)(d) GDPR. Fifth, and finally, the ability of VIEC to demonstrate that it had assessed the risk to processing special category information.

As part of the investigation the security provider for VIEC, ‘Ortus’, conducted a report which determined that the most likely root cause of the breach was that the credentials of a user account at one of the nursing homes were captured on a fake website. The link to that fake website was likely received in a phishing email. The original email that delivered the malicious link in question was not identified by the security provider. The email account was thereby accessed by an unauthorised third party, using the captured credentials. This resulted in unauthorised access to stored emails, and allowed the bad actor to set up email forwarding of all inbound emails to a third party email account. In addition, this issue had been ongoing since 18 July 2020.

The DPC prepared an Inquiry Issues Paper to document the relevant facts of the case, and invited submissions from VIEC, in particular regarding any inaccuracies and/or incomplete facts. Outlining the mitigating factors to be considered, VIEC explained that the assigned DPO was aware of the requirement to report the breach within 72 hours and that this timeline had become exhausted by the time the DPO became aware of the breach. The DPO hastily notified the DPC of the breach and supplemented this notification with additional information. The DPC noted this is an example of good practice on the part of a controller in this regard. In another proposed mitigating factor, VIEC submitted that password for the affected account was reset and a forced logout was performed.

The controller also confirmed, among other things, that 213 data subjects had their personal data compromised, and that 129 of these residents had special category data compromised; 117 of these individuals had health data compromised and 12 had biometric data compromised.

On 11 November 2022 the DPC provided a draft decision to VIEC, and the controller was invited to make further submissions on the proposed infringements. In its response to the draft decision, VIEC asserted that it considered the proposals too excessive, and made a range of submissions in support of their position. VIEC stressed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on its ability to implement data security provisions. In particular, they explained that senior managers were redirected to frontline roles, at a time of increased regularity of phishing attacks.","Following these initial steps (commencement letter, inquiry issues paper, draft decision, other relevant materials, submissions made by VIEC) the DPC issued its final decision. This decision identified three issues for determination, and proceeded to analyse these issues in turn. Firstly, an assessment of the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons of natural persons associated with the processing in question, having regard to VIEC’s own assessment of the risks. Secondly, whether the measures implemented by VIEC prior to the breach were appropriate to ensure ongoing confidentiality, particularly concerning special category data. Thirdly, whether these measures were appropriate in light of any obligations to implement a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of its technical and organisational measures in respect of the security of the system.

With regard to the first question (assessment of the risks), the DPC observed the high number of data subjects involved and the sensitive nature of the data processed, and thus determined that the processing of data by VIEC is to be considered high risk. In addition, there were no specific references to the data protection in the company’s 'risk management policy'. According to the DPC, the VIEC’s use of its email system, and in particular the storing of biometric data and the lack of appropriate technical measures, created the risk of unauthorised access and disclosure. This constituted a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons in terms of both likelihood and severity.

On the second issue, (measures implemented by VIEC to address the risks) the DPC made a number of observations. With regard to data governance,  VIEC's data protection policy appeared to be outdated since it referred to the Data Protection Acts of 1988 and 2003 and did not make reference to the GDPR or the Data Protection Act 2018. Similarly, the Employee Data Policy did not refer to the GDPR. This would suggest that these policies were not reviewed or updated prior or after the GDPR’s entry into force. Furthermore, there was no evidence that VIEC had provided phishing training to its employees prior to the data breach taking place. Moreover, in terms of technical measures, the majority of user passwords were not set to expire and VIEC did not implement multi-factor authentication for users logging into accounts. There was also no journaling in place for emails at the time of the breach, and the controller was therefore unable to search for the original phishing email. Furthermore, with reference to VIEC’s submissions above regarding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the DPC noted that, while the pandemic brought additional challenges, the shortcomings in the controllers processing of data and data security have existed since the implementation of the GDPR.

Addressing the third and final question (processes to test, assess and evaluate the effectiveness of measures) the DPC observed an overall lack of any technical measures to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, or resilience. In terms of organisational measures, VIEC had developed policies to avoid and minimise risk. The company was therefore clearly aware that the use of its email system for the storage and transfer of personal and special category data may present risks to the integrity of the data. However, no follow up action was taken to ensure that these policies were being followed or were effective. Overall, the lack of appropriate testing of technical and organisational measures, led the DPC to conclude that they did not meet the standard required by Articles 5(1)(f) and Article 32 GDPR.

The DPC concluded that the processing by VIEC failed to ensure that the personal data was processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  The processing by the author of the phishing attack was unauthorised and unlawful. The processing by VIEC itself of personal and special category data on its email system prior to the phishing attack, without adequate security measures, placed such data at risk of being unlawfully accessed.

The DPC further added that the adequate technical and organisational measures that may have been employed by VIEC could have included, among others, appropriate encryption of personal data being transferred over external networks, and provision of suitable phishing training. Regular testing of the measures employed would also go some way to ensuring the security of processing.

Therefore, the DPC held that VIEC infringed Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) GDPR, and made an order pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, obliging VIEC to bring its processing operations into compliance with the GDPR; and also issued a reprimand upon the controller pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR. In accordance with article 83 GDPR, and taking into account the factors outlined in Article 58(2)(i) GDPR, the DPC also imposed an administrative fine of €100,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"In this case the controller 'An Garda Síochána', a branch of the Irish national police service, displayed the details of an ongoing investigation on a bulletin board in one of their police stations. This information included a list containing the names and address of 108 data subjects, including vulnerable subjects and persons of interests in ongoing investigations. No individual, other than a police guard, should have had unaccompanied access to the room. A contractor who was undertaking repair works at the An Garda Síochána station entered the room unaccompanied. The list, containing the personal data, was ultimately shared on social media.","Following an investigation the DPA held that, firstly, there was an absence of specific policies, procedures and security measures in relation to data breaches in An Garda Síochána’s processing of personal data. Secondly, there was also an absence of specific security measures in place at the time of the breach relating to the circumstances of the breach, which resulted in the failure of An Garda Síochána to implement a level of security appropriate to the harm that might result from An Garda Síochána's processing of personal data. Thirdly, the authority observed a failure to undertake a risk assessment prior to the commencement of processing on the Intelligence Bulletin, in order to determine the appropriateness of security measures in relation to the harm that might result from the processing. Fourth, An Garda Síochána did not demonstrate or indicate that any pre-breach assessment was conducted pursuant to its role as a controller of personal data. Fifth, and finally, as the data in question concerned ongoing investigations and included the data of vulnerable subjects, the DPA considered it to be highly sensitive.

In light of the above, the DPA found that the controller failed to satisfy the principle of integrity and confidentiality in Article 6(1)(f) GDPR and the requirements of Article 32 GDPR (as implemented in Article 72(1), 75 and 78, and by extension 71(1)(f) of the Irish Data Protection Act 2018). As part of the remediate actions, An Garda Síochána was reprimanded  in respect of the above infringements, and ordered to bring its processing up to the standard required by the GDPR with regard to the security of Intelligence Bulletins throughout the network of police stations in Ireland.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 6"
"The Italian DPA launched an investigation into the insurance broker Assiteca Spa (Assiteca), the controller, as part of the authorities planned inspection activities for 2022, and following a number of complaints. The investigation consisted of carrying out a simulated request for car insurance quotations on two websites operated by the company.

As a preliminary point, the company explained that the services on these two websites were previously implemented by 6Sicuro SpA, a company which merged into Assiteca in July 2021. At the time of the investigation, the two websites had separate IT systems and were undergoing re-engineering.

During the investigation process, the DPA raised several issues regarding the following: first, absence of consent to processing for promotional purposes; second, lack of transparency regarding data processing; third, the retention time of personal data; and fourth, the lack of technical and organisational measures to prevent prejudice to data subjects.

In its defence, the company emphasised that, as a result of the merger, the anomalies detected during the inspection by the Garante were to be considered as “circumscribed effects attributable to the misalignment of the systems and not to a systematic lack of security measures”. In addition, they have, started the process for the acquisition of a new system, and made changes to rectify any technical anomalies at issue here.","Issuing its decision, Italian DPA addressed the four issues identified above. Firstly, regarding consent, following the merger the company had retained the data of nearly 9,700 customers of the previous company without their knowledge by exposing their personal data to potential processing for promotional purposes even in the absence of consent. The DPA found that, due to a system bug, the will of some users was not correctly implemented since some consents were involuntarily given to the system after accessing e-mails containing car insurance quotes. The Company clarified that the event originated from involuntary problems of a technical nature. However, for 9,700 users a consent had been registered that demonstrate genuine intent and, for 2,155 of these, a consent was acquired that had never been expressed, in violation of Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7 GDPR.

Secondly, in terms of transparency, the DPA found that the information provided to data subjects was not sufficiently clear, in particular concerning transfers to third parties and profiling. However, the text of the information notice has been amended, giving a clearer statement of the processing operations carried out and their legal bases. As such, no further action is deemed necessary.

Third, regarding retention, the company had not defined in advance the data retention periods for the individual purposes, in breach of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR.

Fourth, and finally, the DPA also noted the presence of inadequate technical measures for processing, but did not consider sanctioning the company because integration of two different corporate systems had recently been carried out, and the necessary changes have been made.

Pursuant to Article 83 GDPR, the DPA fined the controller €120,000. Determining the amount of the fine, the authority took into account the broad scope of the processing involving 9,700 data subjects; the seriousness of the violation, in misrepresenting the data subjects wishes without their knowledge, and exposing their respective personal data; and the manner the authority had become aware of the violations, as part of an own-volition investigation. However, the DPA also considered a number of mitigating factors, including: that the company’s intentions do not appear to be aimed at consciously achieving the effects; the timely adoption of corrective measures; the absence of previous infringements; and the high degree of cooperation with the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The Szczecin District Court (the controller) stored personal data, among others, on portable USB memory sticks. In 2020, an employee lost three of these USB sticks (one encrypted and two private unencrypted ones) containing draft rulings and personal data of an unidentified number of data subjects, collected during the years 2004-2020. Upon receiving information about this incident, the controller reported the data breach to the Polish DPA who started an ex officio investigation.

The DPA requested information regarding the organisational and technical measures adopted to prevent security breaches. The controller submitted that it had carried out a risk analysis in its data protection impact assessment (DPIA) in which it had rated the loss of personal data as a medium level risk and had introduced the obligation to encrypt any personal data stored on portable media. Moreover, the controller allegedly carried out regular data security training for its staff and performed bi-yearly testing of staff equipment.","First, the DPA recalled that the controller must comply with the principles under Article 5 GDPR, including the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR). According to this principle, personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against accidental loss.

Second, the DPA noted that it is the responsibility of the controller under Article 24(1) GDPR to ensure that appropriate technical and organisational measures are put in place, in accordance with Article 32 GDPR, and that the principle of privacy by design and by default is implemented (Article 25(1) GDPR). In this regard, the DPA held that the risk analysis of the controller did not include all possible threats, such as the loss of confidentiality due to a lack of blockade on USB ports to completely prevent the use of private storage media.

Third, the DPA held that the controller did not properly ensure that employees would not use private and unencrypted portable devices to store personal data. The DPA added that ensuring data security and confidentiality is a continuous process that requires regular reviews of both the adequacy and effectiveness of the adopted technical and organisational measures.

In conclusion, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(f), 24(1), 25(1) and 32 GDPR for the failure to appropriately apply technical and organisational measures which resulted in a breach of confidentiality. Moreover, the controller violated Article 5(2) GDPR by not being able to demonstrate its compliance with the principles under Article 5(1) GDPR. For these violations, the DPA imposed a PLN 30,000 fine on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32"
"Following the Schrems II ruling of 16 July 2020 (CJEU case C-311/18) the European Center for Digital Rights (noyb) lodged 101 complaints to several data protection authorities in the European Economic Area (EEA). All complaints concerned the use of Google Analytics or Facebook Connect on websites in the EEA.

In accordance with Article 80(1) GDPR, noyb lodged a complaint on 17 August 2020 with the Austrian DPA against Telenor ASA (the controller) for their use of Google Analytics on their website and alleged transfer of a data subject's personal data to the US in violation of Article 44 GDPR. The data subject provided the DPA with a HTTP Archive format (HAR) data of the website, i.e., a JSON-formatted archive file format for logging a web browser’s interaction with a website, as proof of US-transfers being made.

As per Article 4(16)(a) GDPR, Telenor’s main establishment is in Norway. Consequently, the Austrian DPA transferred the complaint to the Norwegian DPA in accordance with Article 56(1), who proceeded to investigate the case.

The controller informed the DPA that they in late August 2020 initiated a review project to assess relevant agreements in light of the Schrems II ruling. They found this to apply to their use of Google Analytics since the agreement was with Google as a US processor of their. With the Privacy Shield now invalidated, the controller entered into standard contractual clauses (SCCs) Module Two with Google on 12 August 2020 for data transfers to the US.

However, the controller did not carry out a thorough review of potential third country legislation (a ""transfer impact assessment""), as it, according to information from Google, was not possible to determine the exact location of processing. The decision, however, refers to a statement by Google informing that Google Analytics data is stored in the US.

The parties still agreed supplementary measures. First, Google has established policies and procedures and a team of qualified lawyers for handling authority requests for user data. Second, Google offers and the controller implemented the Anonymize IP feature and, finally, the controller had applied a redaction script on the website to prevent personal data unintentionally being shared with Google.

Google Analytics was implemented on the website until 15 January 2021 and collected, until then, online identifiers, including cookie identifiers, IP addresses, device identifiers and client identifiers. The controller had enabled the IP anonymization feature and therefore argued that the identifiers listed above could not be regarded as personal data as this feature had ""severed any link to an invididual"". Google had also informed them that it would not be possible to extract such data following a potential legally binding authority request. In conclusion, the controller thus argued that the only personal data collected by Google Analytics and subsequently processed by them were IP addresses.","The DPA investigated three main legal questions:

1. Whether or not personal data was processed in the context of Google Analytics.
2. Provided that personal data was processed, whether or not this personal data was transferred to the US.
3. Provided that the personal data was processed and transferred to the US, whether or not this transfer infringed Chapter V GDPR, also considering the Schrems II judgment.

The investigation was limited to the time period from the CJEU’s Schrems II ruling to the controller's discontinuation of Google Analytics, i.e., between 16 July 2020 and 15 January 2021.

The first question

The DPA's assessed the HAR file submitted by the data subject and found that  the following data was processed when visiting the controller's website:

* Unique identifier(s) that identifies the browser/device used to visit the website, as well as a unique identifier that identifies the website operator, in other words the Google Analytics account ID of the website operator,
* Address and HTML title of the website,
* Information on browser, operating system, screen resolution, language settings, as well as the date and time the website was accessed by the data subject,
* The data subject’s IP address. Here, the DPA notes that the anonymization process is carried out on Google’s servers. In other words, the IP address was transferred to Google before it was anonymized.

The DPA notes that as these unique identifiers were set with the specific purpose to differentiate individuals, where differentiation was not possible before, they contribute to making the individual identifiable. They also refer to the findings of the Austrian DPA in a similar case, also referring to a decision by the European Data Protection Supervisor, that these Google Analytics identifiers in principle qualify as personal data.

The IP address and cookie identifiers were combined with, inter alia, the address of the specific website the data subject visited, the time and date of the website visit, as well as metadata about the browser and operating system, and the combination of settings and parameters of the browser and the operating system may sometimes be sufficiently unique to lead to so-called device fingerprinting.

Consequently, the DPA found that both the controller and Google had several elements that combined could enable them to single out visitors on the website where Google Analytics was implemented. Taking all of this into account, the DPA held that the data in question was to be regarded as personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR.

The second question

The DPA held that the controller was not able to demonstrate whether the personal data of the data subject had been transferred to the US or not, as this appeared to depend on factors such as their location and, presumably, internet traffic conditions at the time. The controller's statements suggested that at least for some website visitors in the EEA, their personal data was transferred to a Google server outside the EEA, including in the US. Furthermore, Google’s statements suggested that regardless of which Google server the Google Analytics data was sent to from the website, Google acting as the processor would transfer Google Analytics data to the US or make the data available from the US in the context of their processing on the controller's behalf.

As a result, the DPA found that the controller had most likely, in the context of their implementation of Google Analytics on the website, transferred personal data to the US.

The third question

The DPA referred to the CJEU explicitly finding that a transfer based on SCCs to companies that fall under FISA 702 violate Chapter V if appropriate supplementary measures are not in place. Although the controller claiming that supplementary measures were in place, the DPA notes that it is clear that those measures do not prevent Google from having clear text access to the personal data in question. The DPA further notes that this presumption can of course be rebutted if it is shown that there is no reason to believe that FISA 702 applies to those personal data in practice. In this regard, the controller argued that it would not be possible for Google to provide US intelligence services with access to the IP addresses of visitors to the website prior to anonymization.

However, the DPA referred to their assessment showing  that the scope of the personal data processed was wider than just the IP addresses. Even if it indeed should be the case that FISA 702 did not apply to the IP address in practice, the remaining information about visitors to the website, which constitutes personal data, would presumably still be in scope of FISA 702 in practice. Therefore, the DPA found that the controller's transfer of personal data undermined the level of protection that is guaranteed pursuant to Article 44 GDPR.

Conclusion

Based on the above, the DPA found that personal data of visitors to the controller's website was processed in the context of Google Analytics, that those personal data were transferred to the US, and that this transfer infringed Chapter V GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 44, Article 46, Article 56, Article 58, Article 60, Article 80"

The companies notified the breaches to the DPA, which then opened two investigations.","The DPA found that both companies had violated Article 32(1)b and c and 32(2) GDPR because they had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a sufficient level of security. In accordance with Article 83 GDPR, the DPA therefore imposed a fine of lei11,023.42 (approximately €2,250) on Finopro IFN and lei14,697.90 (approximately €3,000) on Integral Collection.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 83"
"This case concerns A&G Couriers, a company providing courier services, (the “Controller”) which engaged a third party IT software contractor (“Contractor”) to undertake a ""Brexit project"". This project was aimed at providing the UK tax authority (Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs – HMRC) with access to their internal reporting system to facilitate declarations of duty and VAT.

The Contractor immediately began facilitating access to the reports for external review and, while these changes to the system were being made, the server which housed all the data became exposed to the public internet. It was suggested by the Controller that – due to insufficient checks on security patches, user restrictions and access controls by the Contractor – the configuration of the affected server was implemented incorrectly, and the IP address of the affected server was inadvertently.

For a total of two days, the servers, which housed in total, the unencrypted personal data of 446,143 data subjects, were publicly available. This included their names, home addresses, email addresses and mobile numbers. The Controller further clarified that each of these categories of personal data may not be fully present in each record affected by the personal data breach, since the data collected is client specific and not all fields are mandatory.

In addition, an unknown individual gained access to the exposed server and exfiltrated the personal information pertaining to a large number of data subjects. The hacker was able to access the records of 10,000 data subjects in total.

In submissions to the DPC, the Controller outlined their account of the incident and made a number of arguments in its defence. Firstly, the Controller asserted that, depending on the specific data, it was in some cases a controller, and in others a processor, and so the duty to implement appropriate measures was not placed upon them in all circumstances.

Secondly, the controller stated that the servers contained some or all of the following categories of personal data: names, home addresses, email addresses and mobile numbers (as dependent on client requirements). The Controller submitted that, in an objective assessment, the risks posed by the Controller’s processing at the time of the personal data breach involved low to moderate risks, both in likelihood and severity, to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. It is admitted that there was a significant quantity of personal data related to a large number of data subjects processed and stored for a period of thirty days by the Controller, however, this personal data may be considered at the lower end of the scale in terms of sensitivity.","Issuing its final decision, the DPC addressed the two points put forward by the Controller, before setting out findings concerning the technical and organisational security measures in place at the time of the breach.

Firstly, regarding the issue of whether the Controller should be considered a controller or processor, the DPC held that the obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures pursuant to Article 32(1) GDPR applies equally to controllers and processors. As the Controller identified itself as holding either of those roles in respect of the personal data, the obligation to comply with Article 32(1) GDPR applies to all of those circumstances.

Secondly, concerning the categories of personal data and risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, pursuant to Article 32(1)(d) GDPR and in light of the obligation to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures, it is clear the Controller should have conducted a risk assessment before initiating the process of reviewing access to its internal server in the context of the ""Brexit project"". This would have enabled them to identify any possible risk arising from this specific change to the system. The failure to do so aggravated the likelihood of a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Having an urgent project does not allow for any exceptions to the obligation to implement appropriate security measures, and to follow policies and procedures that have been implemented.

Third, on the issue of technical measures the DPC found that, at time of the personal data breach, the personal data stored was not encrypted and the security controls were not designed with regard to the possibility that the affected data could be viewed by an external entity. Due to the change in the parties to whom the reporting system was exposed to, the new risks associated with such a change ought to have been firstly assessed. Accordingly, risk-appropriate measures such as encryption and comprehensive access control procedures should have been implemented before the personal data breach. In that regard, the Controller confirmed that the risk assessment regarding the changes to the systems was not performed, and it failed to implement appropriate mitigating measures.

Fourth, and finally, the DPC made findings regarding the implementation of organisational measures. In doing so it was held that, contrary to the controller’s existing policies and procedures at the time of the personal data breach, the system changes were signed off verbally by a member of the Controller’s IT team and without the approval of the Data & Information Security representative. Moreover, the lack of the risk assessment negatively impacted the Controller’s ability to identify and recognise the risks associated with this change. Therefore, the DPC considered that the organisational measures implemented by the Controller were not appropriate as they did not follow its own Data Protection Policies and Procedures. The DPC also observed a lack of any ""checks and balances"" to ensure that these policies and procedures were fully followed by their staff.

In light of the above, the Controller was issued with a reprimand in respect of the infringement, emphasising the requirement to take all relevant steps to ensure continuous and future compliance with Article 32 GDPR. The DPC also issued an administrative fine on the Controller in the amount of €15,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"Rovigo Hospital, the data controller, stored the data subject's medical records in another patient's folder and inadvertently disclosed their health data to the latter. Upon becoming aware of this, the data controller asked the third party to return the documents and adopted technical and organisational measures to prevent similar data breaches. The controller notified the DPA and the DPA opened an investigation. There was no dispute as to the facts.","The DPA pointed out that medical records constitute 'data relating to health' in the sense of Article 4(15) GDPR. Pursuant to Article 9 GDPR, this special category of data can only be disclosed to third parties on the basis of an appropriate legal ground or prior written authorisation by the data subject. It emphasized that the data controller must comply with the principle of ""integrity and confidentiality"", according to which personal data must be processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security.  This includes the protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing by appropriate technical and organisational measures (Art. 5(1)(f) GDPR).  The DPA acknowledged that the controller acted immediately to minimise the damage and took measures to prevent further breaches, having cooperated with the investigations. However, it held that the disclosure of the data subject’s health data to an unauthorised third party violated Articles 5(1)(f), 9 and 32 GDPR. In view of this, it imposed a fine of €5.000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 32"
"This case concerns the Friuli Centrale University Health Authority, the controller, which (upon instruction from the Friuli Venezia Giulia Regional Council) instructed GPs to validate a list of patients compiled for the supposed purpose of “statistical stratification”. These patients, the data subjects, had been previously identified by the Health Authority, according to its own (unknown) criteria, as being in complex and comorbid conditions and therefore at a high risk of major complications from covid-19 infections. The personal information processed included details of therapies, pathological status, family addresses, living conditions/habits and the procedure for collecting this information imposed upon GPs a disclosure of their patient’s health data without the chance to check if consent had been obtained.

The Italian DPA commenced a preliminary investigation in which they requested specific information from the controller concerning: the initiatives taken to ensure the data was processed lawfully; the purpose of the processing; the methods for obtaining informed consent; a description of whether the data was special category health data or anonymised data; and the impact assessment carried out.

The controller responded to the request by stating, firstly, that the activity is based on a legal provision related to the current state of emergency. Secondly, the three lawful bases for processing (depending on the type of data) are: Article 9(2)(h) GDPR (necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine); Article 9(2)(i) GDPR (for reasons of public interest in the area of public health); and Article 9(2)(g) GDPR (for reasons of substantial public interest). Thirdly, the use of an algorithm was only applied to the data of those who had consented to extraction for this purpose. Finally, that they did not deem it necessary to carry out an impact assessment, as they did not perceive a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In further submissions to the investigation, the controller confirmed that the number of data subjects affected by the activities described was more than 40,000.","Issuing its final decision, the Italian DPA identified three key issues in this case: the absence of an appropriate legal basis for treatment; the information provided to interested parties (transparency); and the lack of any impact assessment.

Firstly, concerning the lawful basis for processing, the DPA asserts that the profiling of patients, consisting of an automated processing of personal data aimed at analysing and predicting the evolution of the individual’s health situation and the possible correlation with other elements of clinical risk, can only be carried out in compliance with specific requirements and adequate guarantees for the rights and freedoms of the interested parties. In particular, the processing at issue can only be carried out on the basis of the specific informed consent of the data subject (Article 9(2)(a) GDPR). The controller’s argument that processing was based on Articles 9(2)(h) or (g) GDPR were dismissed because, among other things, the processing operations could not be considered ‘necessary’ for the treatment of the patient. Accordingly, the controller, by processing special category data without a valid lawful basis, had infringed Article 5(1)(a) and 9 GDPR.

Regarding the second issue (transparency), the controller did not provide any clarification or information in its defence concerning the alleged failure to provide data subjects with information on the processing of personal data. Accordingly, given that none of the exemptions set out in Article 14(5) GDPR apply in this case, the DPA found a violation of the principle of transparency in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the obligations outlined in Article 14 GDPR.

Finally, concerning the lack of any impact assessment, the DPA found that the controller’s assertion that such an assessment was not required could not be upheld. The processing in question concerned data relating to the health of a large number of vulnerable individuals, and so the failure to conduct an impact assessment constituted a violation of Article 35 GDPR.

In light of the above violations, the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €55,000 (Article 58(2)(i) GDPR). In doing so, they took into account: the large number of data subjects affected; the emergency pandemic context; the lack of any reports or complaints from data subjects; and the full cooperation of the controller with the investigation. The DPA also ordered the controller to delete the relevant data within 90 days (Article 58(2)(d) GDPR) and to, within 20 days of this deadline, communicate the measures taken to comply with the order (Article 58(1)(a) GDPR).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 13, Article 14, Article 35, Article 58, Article 82"
"This case involves an own-volition investigation conducted by the Irish DPA (DPC) into Kildare County Council, the controller. In June 2018, Officers from the Special Investigations Unit of the DPC were authorised to conduct a range of inquiries pertaining to surveillance technologies deployed by state authorities, including An Garda Síochána (the national police) and various local authorities, including Kildare County Council. These inquiries sought to determine whether the data processing was lawful, and also to ensure that full accountability measures for the collection and processing of personal data were in place, in advance of further investment in and deployment of newer surveillance technology.

The investigation into Kildare County Council focused on the following: the legal basis for surveillance technology employed for the purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting crime; the legal basis for surveillance tech deployed for purposes other than preventing, investigating, detecting, or prosecuting crime; appropriate signage and general transparency; and the question of a joint controller agreement between the council and the national police. Furthermore, the authority sought to examine the security measures for traffic management CCTV; housing department CCTV; and the transmission of CCTV footage to An Garda Síochána.","Issuing its final decision, the DPC began by establishing that not all of the processing of personal data in question is regulated by the GDPR. Any processing of personal data for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offences is regulated by the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) supplemented into Irish law by the Irish Data Protection Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”). The other personal data processing at issue here is covered by the GDPR. For further information and relevant legal provisions, please see Article 2(2)(d) GDPR, Articles 1 and 2 LED, and Part 5 and 6 of the 2018 Act.

The first issue addressed in the DPC’s decision was the legal basis for the surveillance technologies employed for the purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting crime. In particular, this concerned CCTV systems deployed in a number of housing estates and Traveller caravan parks in the area. While the County Council initially submitted that the lawful basis for this processing was Article 6(1)(c) and 6(1)(d) GDPR, after clarifying that the relevant regime is the LED, the DPC sought to examine the justification for processing in light of this Directive and the 2018 Act. The controller sought to rely on its ‘estate management functions’ as set out in domestic housing legislation, and the powers to combat anti-social behaviour afforded therein. In accordance with the 2018 Act, personal data must be processed lawfully and fairly (Section 71(1)(a)) and the processing will only be lawful where the subject has given their consent, or where the processing is necessary for the performance of a function of the controller for a purpose specified in Section 70(1)(a) and the function has a legal basis in the law of the EU or Ireland (Section 71(2)). Furthermore, for special category data, one of the additional nine conditions in Article 73(1)(b) must be met. After examining the case, the DPC found no requirement to support the development of CCTV cameras in the estates as described above. The cited Irish legislation places no requirement upon the local authority to monitor in this way, and makes no reference to CCTV cameras. Furthermore, given that Irish Travellers are an ethnic group, and their accommodation has a distinct design and layout, the activities also represented the illegal processing of special category data. The DPC found an infringement of Sections 71(1)(a) and 73 of the 2018 Act.

With regards to CCTV cameras located on the grounds of 2 supermarkets for the purpose of detecting illegal dumping. The investigation found that these cameras had not been operational before, during or after the investigation, and accordingly the DPC found no violation of the 2018 Act.

Thereafter the DPC decision addressed the second issue: the legal basis for the surveillance technologies employed for purposes other than for preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting crime. In particular, the authority investigated CCTV used for: traffic management; the sharing of live feed traffic with An Garda Síochána; and the use of ANPR cameras, which recognise and digitise number plates. With regard to processing for traffic management, the Council sought to rely on the Irish Roads Act 1993, which places obligations upon public authorities to, among other things, provide for the safety or convenience of road users. Accordingly, the council argued they had a lawful basis for processing was in the public interest (Article 6(1)(e) GDPR). The DPC held that, given the significant potential impact to fundamental rights of a widespread video surveillance system, the Roads Act is not sufficiently clear, precise or foreseeable to constitute a valid legal basis for the processing of personal data in accordance with Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. There was also a complete lack of legal basis for the sharing of a live traffic feed with An Garda Síochána. Furthermore, for the use of ANPR cameras to be lawful under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, it would be necessary for the legislature to specifically grant power to the local authority to carry out such processing in a manner which is clear, precise and foreseeable for the data subjects. As the Roads Act does not explicitly permit such processing, the Council does not have a lawful basis to operate ANPR cameras. In light of the above, the DPC found that the Council had violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in all 3 respects.

The third question investigated was the presence of appropriate signage and general transparency. The investigation found that no appropriate signage had been installed to inform data subjects of the use of CCTV for traffic management purposes. Accordingly, the DPC held there had been a violation of Article 13 GDPR.

Regarding the fourth issue, the DPC investigated the question of whether the Kildare County Council could be considered “joint controllers” with respect to Article 26 GDPR. The Decision finds that while An Garda Síochána used the CCTV footage for the prevention of crime, there is no evidence that the two entities “jointly” determined the purposes of processing. In other words, there is no connection between the Council’s decision to use the cameras for traffic management purposes and An Garda Síochána’s decision to then use the live feed for monitoring and preventing crime. Accordingly, the Council has not violated Article 26 GDPR.

The DPC also made a number of findings regarding the security measures implemented by the Council. The Council failed to maintain a data log that recorded which users had accessed the CCTV cameras, thereby infringing Article 32(1) GDPR. The Council also violated Sections 71(1)(f), 72(1) and 78 of the 2018 Act by failing to implement appropriate technical or organisational security measures when installing the CCTV cameras. Furthermore, by failing to keep a data log, the Council also violated Section 82(2) of the 2018 Act. The Council also infringed Section 71(1)(c) and Section 76(2) of the 2018 Act by recording CCTV of private properties, in the absence of any privacy masking technology. Additionally, the Council infringed Section 71(10) of the 2018 Act by failing to be in a position to demonstrate that its processing of personal data via CCTV cameras at one location was not excessive to its purpose of preventing anti-social behaviour. Finally, The Council infringed its obligations under Sections 71(1)(f), 72(1) and 78 of the 2018 Act in connection with arrangements surrounding the transfer of personal data to An Garda Síochána using unencrypted USB sticks.

Exercising its corrective powers, the DPC imposed a temporary ban on the processing of personal data with CCTV for the purposes of criminal law enforcement and traffic management, until a legal basis can be identified. Furthermore, they imposed an order for Kildare County Council to bring its processing into compliance with the legislation, and imposed an administrative fine of €50,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 26, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83"

"Commify Italia s.r.l. (controller) offers to business customers the service available at the Skebby platform (www.skebby.it) by which text messages can be sent via a web application or through application programming interfaces.

The Italian DPA carried out inspection activities at the controller place of business on several occasions: in 2018 as a result of a data breach notified by a client of the controller. In 2019 as a result of additional documentation provided by the controller and a complaint from which it emerged the potential unlawful storage of the content of text messages sent through the platform. Precisely with regard to the lawfulness of the procedures adopted regarding the storage of the content of text messages sent, in 2021 the DPO of a client company requested the intervention of the Italian DPA. As a result, the Italian DPA carried out a further inspection to verify the functioning of the platform.

The inspection revealed that:

•	The controller stored in its systems the content of messages sent by its customers, which also included special categories of personal data (such as, reservations for health services, messages sent by political parties to their members). The controller justified this retention on the grounds that the content of the messages was to be considered traffic data in accordance with Article 121(1-bis)(h) of Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003 (the Italian Data Protection Code) with the consequent obligation to retain them pursuant to Articles 123 and 132 of the Code.

•	With regard to the technical and organisational measures taken by the controller, it appeared that the traffic data (including the content of text messages) were stored in the controller's systems without any physical or logical distinction according to the purpose of retention (e.g. crime prevention and prosecution, billing, making the text available to the customer for consultation). Consequently, there was also no differentiation of retention periods according to each purpose. Access to these systems was possible for authorised personnel by means of one-factor authentication (e.g. username and password). The controller had not adopted any system for keeping track of the operations performed on the systems by persons acting under its authority. Finally, the transmission of data between the computer systems of some customers and the controller took place using insecure communication protocols (http), thus exposing the transmitted data to risks of unlawful acquisition or manipulation.

•	The controller performed automated checks on the content of messages sent by its customers in order to prevent fraudulent use of the service. To this end, it used preventive analysis systems by means of detection algorithms (URL, domain, keywords), blocking the sending of messages if potential fraudulent content was detected in the alias (alphanumeric string that identifies the sender instead of the telephone number), or in the text (e.g. in the case of links not expressly requested by the customer or for which the customer was not authorised, as well as in the presence of prohibited keywords).","Firstly, the Italian DPA rejected the objection raised by the controller that the notification of the infringements was untimely served. According to the controller, the notice of the opening of the sanctioning procedure was notified 146 days after the last inspection and 1223 days after the first one. According to the Italian DPA, on the other hand, the act would have been notified within the timeframe provided for by the authority's internal regulation no. 2/2019, which states that the notification of the opening of the sanctioning procedure must take place within 120 days from the inspection. According to the Italian DPA, the inspection takes place not at the moment of acquisition of the documents, but from the moment when the authority, having examined the documents, is able to form its own judgement.

According to the Italian DPA, the controller would qualify as a provider of electronic communication services accessible to the public because of the specific characteristics of the services offered, similar in result to traditional telecommunication services although provided through a different technology. According to the Italian DPA, the processing carried out through the platform concerned data relating to a ""telematic"" service, which also involved the processing of personal data (including special categories of personal data) of natural persons to whom the text messages were sent. Consequently, the Italian DPA applied the GDPR and the rules on electronic communications contained in the Code.

According to the Italian DPA, the security measures, both technical and organisational, adopted by the controller were not adequate to the risk involved in the processing. The controller should have taken at least the measures specified in the Italian DPA's general resolution of 17 January 2008 (web doc. no. 1482111). The controller's conduct constituted a breach of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR and Articles 123, 132 and 132ter of the Code.

Contrary to what was claimed by the controller, the Italian DPA denied that the content of the text messages was subject to any retention obligation imposed by law under the combined provisions of Articles 121, 123 and 132 of the Code. On the contrary, the storage of such data was expressly prohibited unless authorised by the user with specific consent for the provision of value-added services pursuant to Article 123(3) of the Code. The Italian DPA observed that the definition of 'traffic data' proposed by Article 121 Code would be too general to be considered in isolation and should therefore be complemented by Articles 123 and 132 Code. Article 123 would allow the retention of traffic data for billing purposes: the content of the messages would have no relevance to that purpose and therefore their retention could not be justified by this provision of law. Article 132 would allow retention for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting crimes, but expressly excluded the possibility of retaining the content of communications. The Italian DPA specified that the content of the text messages could have been retained for the provision of value-added services, but that the case at hand could not be brought within this hypothesis. Retention for that purpose was in fact only possible with the consent of the user. In the present case, no consent was required from the customer since the controller imposed such retention through the contractual terms and conditions of the service. Moreover, access to this data should have been allowed only to the user and not also to the controller's employees. Instead, the content of the messages was accessible to the controller's employees and was made available to the customer only upon specific request. The Italian DPA concluded by observing that the storage of the content of the communications had been carried out in the absence of an appropriate legal basis and that the controller had consequently also infringed the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation since the content of the messages, which in the absence of the user's consent should have been deleted after being sent, was retained without need for purposes other than those which had given rise to the original processing. For these reasons, the Italian DPA found a breach of Articles 5(1)(a), (b) and (c) and 6 GDPR and of Articles 123 and 132 of the Code.

With regard to the scanning of the content of the communications in order to prevent fraudulent use of the services, with immediate blocking of the dispatch by the control systems, the Italian DPA observed that a processing so prejudicial to the freedoms of the data subjects could not be justified by the need to protect an interest of the controller. The interest pursued by the controller, consisting in the desire to avoid indirect involvement in judicial activities, would have been merely hypothetical and in any case related to normal business risk. The Italian DPA noted that the controller had not carried out any assessment as to the balancing of the interests involved in such processing, since the controller had merely considered its actions to be in line with standard market practices and had only generically invoked a legitimate interest in its statement of defence of 4 May 2022. According to the Italian DPA, that processing was unlawful because the controller had not identified any legal basis that could justify it, in breach of Articles 5(1)(a) and 6 GDPR.

Finally, the Italian DPA found a violation of Article 25(1) and (2) GDPR because the controller had not adopted adequate measures and safeguards to implement the principles of 'lawfulness, fairness and transparency', 'purpose limitation', 'data minimisation' and 'integrity and confidentiality'.

As a result of the corrective measures already taken by the company, the Italian DPA did not impose any corrective measure on the controller, and only issued two warnings regarding violations arising from automated monitoring of text messages for anti-fraud purposes and for violations of the principles of privacy by design and by default. The Italian DPA also applied a fine of €80,000 for the violations found.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 25, Article 32"
"A data subject made an objection request to marketing communications received from a fashion retailer (the controller). The controller indicated that it would comply with the request, but continued sending marketing communications to the data subject.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA which started an investigation on that matter.

The investigation revealed that, in order to exercise their right, the data subject had to submit a written, dated and signed request. Moreover, it revealed that the information notice did not cover the information on data recipients, retention terms or the right to lodge a complaint to the DPA.","The DPA found that by requiring to the data subject to submit his request in a written, signed and dated form, the controller imposed excessive conditions for the exercise of the data subjects' rights, in breach of Articles 12. Also, the DPA found that the data controller violated Article 13 GDPR since the information notice did not provide complete, correct, accurate, and updated information.

The DPA imposed a fine of RON 9871 (approximately €2000) for these violations. In accordance with Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA also imposed corrective measures.

First, the DPA ordered the data controller to facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights by removing the excessive condition of requesting the data subjects to submit a ""written, dated and signed"" request, when exercising their rights.

Second, it ordered the controller to take appropriate measures in order to comply with the GDPR provisions, so that, in the future, the personal data used for direct marketing will only be processed based on the data subject's consent, to implement related internal procedures in this respect and to amend the relevant sections on the website to reflect such flow.

"The Padua University Hospital notified the Italian DPA of a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR. The hospital accidentally sent to all the patients involved in a clinical trial an email in which the patients' email addresses were not put in BCC (blind carbon copy) but in CC (carbon copy), unintentionally making known the email addresses of all patients waiting for heart transplant.

In order to remedy the violation and reduce its negative effects on the people involved, instructions were given to inform each individual concerned about the mistake, urging them delete the email previously sent and not to use the email addresses of other recipients.

The Italian DPA investigated whether the processing of personal data of the email recipients was in violation of the basic principles set out in Article 5 GDPR.

The hospital argued that the seriousness of the potential impact for the interested parties was average, considering that the health data - the existence of a scheduled heart transplant - were isolated and common to all the interested parties and not accompanied by any other sensitive data. Furthermore, out of 19 email addresses only 7 were recognizable, while the other 12 were not immediately traceable to the account holder. The hospital further argued that the violation was partly due to the COVID – 19 pandemic and the shortage of staff. Finally, the hospital stated that the author of the violation certainly did not benefit from the violation and no complaints were received from the data subjects following breach notification to the data subjects.

The hospital also provided for the technical and organizational measures to be carried out in order to prevent data breaches in the future. These included staff training on the use of telematic tools in in the communication with patients.","The DPA found that the arguments put forward by the controller were not sufficient to drop the case.

In the first place, email addresses in themselves fall within the notion of personal data and are therefore subject to the GDPR. Moreover, the DPA held that it could be implied from the context of the email communication that the recipients were patients waiting for a heart transplant. The sending of the aforementioned communication by means of a single email message addressed to multiple recipients, to the extent that the addresses were not encrypted with BCC, did in fact reciprocally disclose to the recipients of the same communication the state of health of the other patients.

For these reasons, the DPA declared the unlawfulness of the processing and a violation of the basic principles set out in Articles 5(1)(f) and 9 GDPR.

Pursuant to Articles 58(2)(i) and 83(5) GDPR, the DPA issued an administrative sanction of €5,000.

"Between 21 May and 14 June 2021, Argon Medical Devices, Inc. (the controller) experienced a cyber security incident. It was discovered on 14 June 2021 when the controller's US Senior Vice President of Human Resources noticed missing emails in his inbox.

Upon further investigation, the controller determined that it had been subject to a business email compromise, perpetrated through an internal platform by an unauthorized third party, most likely through a phishing email. Consequently, the Director of Global IT Security put in place several cyber security measures, which appear to have contained the incident on 14 June 2021.

On 15 June 2021, they reported the incident to the local FBI Cybercrime Unit in the US and commenced an internal investigation to determine the extent and nature of the incident.

On 19 July 2021 they realized that personal data such as salary and benefits of all of their (20) European employees, including one in Norway, had been affected, and proceeded to assess whether the incident was reportable under Article 33(1) GDPR.

On 24 September 2021, after concluding that the incident was indeed reportable, the controller hired a Norwegian law firm to notify the Norwegian DPA. Since the controller has several establishments in the EU/EEA, they also sent similar breach notifications to several other European supervisory authorities.

In this regard, they acknowledged that “Argon in the US [i.e., Argon Medical Devices, Inc.] is the data controller with respect to the personal data connected to this Incident”. They also stated that their ""European head office resides in Switzerland, and only its Swiss establishment enjoys a power of direction and control over its other EU/EEA establishments. Therefore, Argon does not have a main establishment in the EU/EEA for the purposes of Article 4(16) GDPR.""

Consequently, the DPA concluded that the cooperation mechanism and procedure set out in Article 56(1) GDPR and Article 60 GDPR did not apply in this case and, thus, pursuant to Article 55(1) GDPR, the DPA was competent to perform the tasks assigned to them and exercise the powers conferred on them by the GDPR in relation to the personal data breach notification. The controller did not dispute this in their written representations.

On 4 October 2021 the DPA sent the controller a request for further information and asked them to, in particular, clarify why they concluded that the incident was reportable only on 21 September 2021.

The controller held that they had acted ""without undue delay, to notify the supervisory authorities within 72 hours"". Their main claim was that it was necessary to investigate the incident in order to determine if it was reportable or not, which they were only able to conclude on 21 September 2021.

On 31 January 2022, the DPA sent the controller an advance notification of their intention to fine them NOK 2 500 000 for having violated Article 33(1) GDPR.

"This case concerns the Bank of Ireland (BOI) (the controller) and a data breach on the “BOI365” online banking platform. Between 30 January 2020 and 6 May 2020 the Irish DPA (DPC) received ten personal data breach notifications. In six of these breaches, unauthorised persons gained access to customer accounts online as a result of bank staff not following procedures correctly. The other four breaches were a result of flaws in the customer information system.

On 12 August 2020, the DPC commenced an inquiry and the controller provided submissions on 25 November 2022 concerning: risk; methodology for assessment; testing; training and quality assurance; and categorisation of BOI’s actions.","Issuing its decision, the DPC sought to determine whether the BOI has infringed Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GPDR in respect of its processing of personal data via the “BOI365” Service. The DPC’s holding addressed two main issues, the assessment of the risks and the appropriate level of security.

Firstly, concerning the assessment of risks, the controller had argued that up until this instance, as far as they were aware, there had never been an instance of fraud or identity theft arising from these types of events. Therefore, in assessing the risk, it had appeared that it was only a potential harm. However, the DPC  dismissed this argument, finding that, even if the risk had not materialised into a harm previosuly, this does not reduce the severity of the risk itself. They found that there is a high risk of fraud and identity theft, particularly to vulnerable users, and that these risks are heightened further by the large quantity of data stored on the platform. Overall, in terms of severity, the processing on the BOI365 platform posed a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

Secondly, regarding the appropriate level of security, it has held that BOI had a range of Data Protection Governance policies and procedures in place to ensure the integrity and security of customers’ personal data. However, these policies and procedures did not include additional controls to minimise the possibility of human error occurring. Furthermore, the DPC found that, while training should be informed by the risks arising from the processing activities, the issues associated with merging customer accounts were not explained to staff in detail. In addition, the data governance policies did not include additional controls to prevent human error. Regarding security measures, there was a lack of testing the measures in place, and an absence of organisational oversight.

In light of the above, the DPC found that BOI had infringed the principle of integrity and confidentiality of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32(1) GDPR by failing to ensure appropriate security of the personal data related to its customer accounts. In accordance with Article 58(2) GDPR, the DPC issued an order to bring processing into compliance, reprimanded the controller for the violations, and imposed an administrative fine of €750,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"The data subject was the victim of a crime that was being covered by the media in Spain. During the case trial, the the data subject gave a testimony reporting the details of the crime. Telecinco, the controller, and other media channels, released the original audio without distorting the data subject's voice.

The DPA initiated an investigation after a complaint was filed and ordered the controller to remove the data subject's voice from their website. In response, the controller argued that the mere hypothetical possibility of singling out an individual is not sufficient to consider the person as identifiable. In their view, taking into account all the means that may reasonably be used by the controller or any other person, such a possibility does not exist or is either negligible. Therefore, the voice cannot be considered as personal data. It also claimed that the original source of the data was the Court, which distributed the recording to all media channels without applying any prior voice distortion or giving any instructions in this regard. Finally, it alleged that coverage of crimes is of public interest and that restricting the publication would infringe their right to freedom of expression.","The DPA stated that the voice is personal data since it enables the identification of an individual, regardless of the number of persons who may recognise it. It emphasized that it is an individual attribute defined by its pitch, intensity and timbre. According to the DPA, the voice is endowed with unique and singular distinctive features that makes it possible to infer not only the person's age, sex and state of health but also their way of being, culture, origin and their hormonal, emotional and psychic state. In this sense, elements of expression, idiolect or intonation are also personal data considered together with the voice. It highlighted that, in line with Recital 75 GDPR, risk must be interpreted as any circumstance that may give rise to a damage, without the need for this damage to materialise.

In the case at hand, there was a high risk that the victim would be identified at the very least in their closest circle and then subjected to a second victimization. The DPA clarified that the object of the investigation was the dissemination of the victim's voice by the media and not other data processings such as those carried out by the Court. It reaffirmed the position of Telecinco as a controller since it decided what data to publish and how. It noted that where there is a ""processing chain"", i.e. different and subsequent processing operations carried out by different controllers, each controller is responsible for the decisions it takes in its own sphere with regard to its processing. They cannot rely on what the previous controller did in order to be exempted from liability, just as they will not be held liable for the decisions taken by the controller further down the chain.

Finally, it recalled a decision from the Spanish Constitutional Court (27/2020), in which it analyzed whether the non-consensual reproduction of the image of an anonymous person who suddenly and involuntarily acquired a role in a newsworthy event, in this case as a victim, violated their individual rights. The Court held the limit of freedom of expression and access to information lies in the individualisation, direct or indirect, of the victim, as this data neither in the public interest nor relevant to the information provided. Likewise, the DPA found that although the facts under analysis were relevant for the general public, the identity of the victim was not, particularly because they are not a public figure.

Therefore, the DPA found that the controller processed data which were excessive for the purpose of informing the public and fined it €50,000 for violating Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5
"Hackers invaded the information systems of the accommodation service provider Forenom, the controller. They gained access to a database containing approximately 165.000 personal details of the controller's customers. After receiving complaints from affected data subjects, the Finnish DPA  launched investigations to ascertain the circumstances of the data leak. When asked to comment on the facts, the controller argued that the type of data collected depended on the group to which the person belonged, whether tenant, owner or company contacts. As for the data retention period, landlord and tenant information were kept for 10 years from the end of the tenancy or contract, while customer relationship management data were kept for 5 years since the last activity. According to the controller, long-term apartment rentals play a significant role in its business. Therefore, they found it necessary to keep the data to respond to eventual compensation claims that, based on the national Accounting Act, can be made within a 10-year time limit. After this period, the data were either deleted or anonymized.","The DPA held that  the data controller did not comply with the data minimization principle nor with the storage limitation principle. It emphasized that not all accommodation and tenancy information would fall under the scope of the the Accounting Act and that the controller did not provide a clear explanation of which data was being retained for 10 years and why. According to the DPA, the controller must also implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure by default that only necessary personal data were being processed for the purpose of responding to eventual damage claims. It recalled that this obligation applies not only in relation to the amount of personal data collected, but also to the storage time and the availability of the data.  Finally, the DPA stated that the controller failed to assess the possible risks involved in retaining such data and to take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to prevent these risks.

* regarding the mobile app, no privacy policy was available before the download and once the application was installed, the privacy policy was not easily accessible;
* the privacy policy was only available in two languages, whereas the website was available in three languages; and
* the privacy policy did not mention the length of time for which the data would be kept or the right to restrict processing.

The controller replied that the unavailability of the information was due to the attitude of the service provider who managed his site and application.","The DPA considered that the privacy policy, by mentionning certain processing operations that were actually not carried out, did not reflect reality and that the controller did not provide the required information in a comprehensible manner, in clear and simple terms, in violation of Article 12(1).

It also found a lack of information, in breach of Articles 13(2)(a) and 13(2)(b): the information regarding the length of time the data will be kept was missing for certain processing activities. Concerning the rights of the data subjects, there was no information about the right to restrict.

"During a recruitment procedure, an employee of the Bank of Italy (the controller) accidentally sent an email to 500 participants, where the email address of each of the candidates was clearly visible. By using the carbon copy (CC) instead of the blind carbon copy (BCC) option, the employee disclosed the email addresses of the job applicants to one another.

The email in question contained general information including a feedback request. The employee did not inform the office in charge of data protection and the participants did not raise any complaints. Consequently, in the immediate aftermath of the event, the Bank could not activate a data breach procedure, which provides for the involvement of the DPO and other staff members responsible for compliance with the GDPR and the relevant national legislation.

When the controller became aware of the breach, it sent another email to the job applicants instructing them to delete the email containing the visible addresses and not to use them or disclose them to third parties. The controller also argued that the event was an isolated one and it did not reflect the organisational measures that the Bank of Italy applies to the protection of personal data.

"The Italian DPA after receiving complaint from Inder Kahlon on 24th February 2023 (Numero protocollo: 0033835) opened an investigation concerning ChatGPT, an AI service offered by the American company OpenAI. The investigation focused on three main areas.

First, the controller did not provide the data subjects whose personal data had been collected through the Internet with appropriate information about the processing.

Second, the DPA found that ChatGPT final outcome – its “answers” – despite based also on personal data and thus often containing personal data, did not always represent reality in an accurate way.

Finally, the investigation showed that OpenAI did not adopt any measure to check that users were above the minimum age requirement of 13 years.","The Italian DPA held that the controller did not comply with its obligation to provide data subjects with a privacy policy pursuant to Article 13 GDPR.

Moreover, the collection of personal data and their use in the training of ChatGPT algorithms were undertaken in lack of a proper legal basis,in violation of Article 5 and 6 GDPR.

Concerning specifically data of people other than the users, namely those data subjects whose data were collected on the internet, the DPA found that the algorithms behind the functioning of ChatGPT did not guarantee the principle of accuracy as enshrined in Article 5(1)(d).

Finally, the DPA also considered that the lack of any mechanism to check the age of the users entailed a violation of Article 8 GDPR.

In light of the above and in the context of an urgency procedure, the DPA imposed on OpenAI a temporary limitation of processing pursuant to Article 58(2)(f) GDPR. Such limitation concerns all processing operations involving data subjects on the Italian territory.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 8, Article 13"
"The Spanish DPA launched an investigation against the controller, owner of a pornographic website, due to possible processing of personal data and profiling of minors under fourteen years of age. During the investigations, several violations of the GDPR were found.

Firstly, the controller denied the processing of minors' personal data, except for basic contact information in a specific section where the user must register with a username, password and email. However, their privacy policy indicated otherwise. It actually prohibited minors under 14 years of age from providing their data and required parental consent for those under 18. Similarly, the controller denied performing any profiling and stated that their cookies analyze visits primarily to see where users navigate on their pages. However, in their privacy policy they admit collecting IP addresses, names, email addresses and other data to generate a user profile. This profile includes: location, gender, age, sexual preferences and media content.

Secondly, the DPA observed that when a user entered the website for the first time, a pop-up window asked them to declare that they were of legal age. However, by clicking anywhere outside the confirmation area access to the website was allowed without any restrictions. Personal data, such as name and email, were collected when the user registered on the site without any age verification. Registered users could then access and share videos, see profiles of other users and share their own profiles.

Thirdly, by accepting the legal notice on cookies, users implicitly accepted their use and there was no option to access the website while rejecting the cookies.

Fourthly, the DPA verified that the controller was processing data for purposes other than those established in their privacy policy which stated that data would be shared with ""tax and accounting consultancy (in case of purchase through the website)."" However, in the activity records submitted to the DPA, they also included the processing of data to maintain a contractual relationship with the user.

Fifthly, there was no information in their privacy policy as to the retention period, but the controller stated that personal data obtained from non-registered users were kept for 365 days for statistical and marketing purposes, while personal data obtained from registered users were kept for an indefinite period. Moreover, the controller was not able to present proper records of the processing activities nor a general description of the technical and organizational security measures adopted.

Finally, the DPA noted that the controller requested data subjects to present their national ID in order to exercise their rights.","Firstly, the DPA stressed that Article 5(1)(a) GDPR establishes that personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently. In the case at hand, the DPA noticed a lack of clarity about what user data were being collected and for which purposes. It stated that the provision of contradictory, unclear and incorrect information frustrated the transparency principle, even if the required information was technically provided in the privacy policy.

Secondly, the DPA pointed out that while the GDPR requires parental consent for children under 16 years old, the Spanish LOPDGDD requires it from children under 14. Provided that there were no effective mechanisms to verify the age of the users, the DPA also found a violation of Article 8 GDPR.

Thirdly, the DPA highlighted the need for a cookie banner on the website's first layer providing clear and concise information about the cookies being used and how users can accept, configure or reject their use. It also recalled that the user must give explicit consent for cookies that are not strictly necessary and that scrolling or navigating through the website shall not be considered for this purpose. In the case at stake, the DPA found that the absence of such banner on the website and the use of third-party cookies without prior consent violated Article 22(2) LSSI.

Fourthly, the DPA emphasized that the purpose limitation principle, provided for by Article 5(1)(b), requires that personal data be collected for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not be processed in a way that is incompatible with those purposes. It held that the controller violated this principle by processing personal data for a purpose other than that stated in its privacy policy.

Fifthly, the DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(e) for maintaining personal data of registered users indefinitely and a violation of Article 13 for not providing information about the retention period in their privacy policy.

Finally, the DPA considered that requiring the presentation of an ID as a condition for the exercise of data protection rights infringes Article 12(2) GDPR which establishes that controller shall facilitate it.

On top of that, the DPA considered that the systematic violation of data protection rules by the data controller constitutes also an infringement of the obligation to implement privacy by design and by default as provided for by Article 25 GDPR.

In view of the above, DPA fined the controller 75.000 euros for violating Article 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b), 5(1)(e), 13, 12(2), 30(1), 8 and 25 GDPR, as well as for violating Article 22(2) LSSI.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 8, Article 12, Article 13, Article 25, Article 30"
"The controller is Cityscoot, a company that rents out shared electric scooters via a mobile application. The controller operated cross-border processing operations but its main establishment was in France. In accordance with Article 56, the CNIL was therefore competent. In May 2020, the CNIL organised an investigation of the controller's website and mobile app. This investigation mainly highlighted three points.

First, the company's scooters were equipped with electronic boxes containing a SIM card and a GPS geo-location system. This allowed location data to be collected every 30 seconds when the scooter was active and every 15 minutes when it was not. This data was collected by the company for the following purposes: detecting and handling traffic offenses, handling customer complaints, user support (in order to call for help in case of a user's fall), claims and theft management.

Second, the controller used 15 processors on the basis of contracts that did not contain all the information required by the GDPR. For example, one of the contracts did not mention the processor's obligation to make available to the controller all the information to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down. Another contract did not mention the purpose of the data processing or its duration.

Third, the controller did not provide information and did not have a consent banner for cookies on its website.","First, the CNIL began by pointing out that geolocation data, when a scooter is rented, constitute personal data. It referred to the EDPB guidelines 01/2020 and considered that this is sensitive data in the common sense of the term, even though it is not covered by Article 9. On the other hand, when the scooter is not rented, the data is not personal.

The CNIL then analysed the relevance and necessity of the data collection for each purpose. Regarding the management of traffic offences, the CNIL considered that it was sufficient to know the date and time of the start and end of the rental and the date and time of the offence to meet this purpose. It also considered that the collection of data from all scooters every 30 seconds was excessive for this purpose insofar as it did not concern all users and only served an incidental purpose in the event that a user wished to contest an offence. For the handling of customer complaints, it considered that the collection of information every 30 seconds was not necessary for the purpose. It explained that less intrusive mechanisms could be used, such as triggering geolocation when the user requests help on the application or sending a text message to confirm that the user has ended the rental. Concerning the management of thefts during rentals, the CNIL considered that even if the controller did not cross-reference geolocation data with user data, the possibility of doing this reconciliation between the different databases justified that the scooter position data be subject to the RGPD. In this case, the CNIL considered that the permanent collection was excessive to achieve the purpose of managing thefts. It considered that geolocation should, for example, be collected from the declaration of theft. For accident management, the DPA considered that geolocation should be activated only when an accident occurs/is reported and not permanently. It was therefore not necessary to collect the geolocation of scooters every 30 seconds to provide assistance in the event of an accident. The CNIL concluded that none of the purposes justified collecting location data every 30 seconds, in violation of Article 5(1)(c).

Second, as regards the relationship between the controller and its processors, the CNIL considered that the contracts were too incomplete and found a clear breach of Article 28(3).

Third, the CNIL considered that the controller could not rely on the exemption under domestic law and therefore had to inform and collect the consent of users to place cookies under Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. The controller therefore violated this provision.

Consequently, the CNIL found a violation of Articles 5(1)(c) and 28(3) GDPR and imposed a fine of €100,000. For the violation of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act it imposed a fine of €25,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 28, Article 56"
"The controller installed a GPS tracker on a company car.

The data subject, namely the employee using that company car, filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, indicating that he was not aware of the existence of the GPS tracker and that the controller did not inform him about the processing purposes, applicable legal grounds, and retention periods. Also, the data subject stated that the personal data collected through the GPS tracker were not only processed for the purpose of monitoring the company car.

Following this complaint, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. It revealed that the data controller processed the personal data collected through the GPS tracker, without providing the data subject with complete information in relation to such processing activities. Also, it was found that the controller processed the data for various purposes and that it collected location data outside of working hours.

The investigation also showed that the controller stored the data after the expiration of 30-day storage period, provided by Article 5 of Law No. 190/2018, without being able to prove that exceeding the 30-day period was based on justified reasons, as required under the law.","The DPA found that the controller was processing data without providing complete and correct information and in an excessive way (outside the working hours), without being able to demonstrate that other less intrusive means were possible. The controller thus violated Article 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 5(1)(e), 5(2) and Article 6 GDPR. As such, the DPA imposed a fine in the amount of RON 14,697.9 (approximately €3,000).

Moreover, the DPA found that by exceeding the 30-day term for retaining the personal data collected through the GPS tracker, without any justified reasons in this respect, the data controller violated the provisions of Article 5(1)(e) and Article 5(2) GDPR. For such, the DPA imposed a fine in the amount of RON 9,798.6 (approximately €2000).

In accordance with Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA also imposed corrective measures. First, it ordered the data controller to reassess the use of location data from the GPS tracker to achieve the purposes of the processing and to avoid excessive collection of data. Second, the DPA ordered the controller to limit the data storage period.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The Italian DPA opened a procedure concerning a newspaper publishing photographs of data subjects involved in police investigations. More specifically, these pictures were originally taken within police offices and for police purposes. The controller immediately removed the contents from its website and stated that it was not aware of the true nature of the images. The controller also claimed to have processed those data for journalistic purposes.","The DPA stated that journalists can disseminate personal data to the public without data subjects’ consent, provided that the principle of essentiality of information is respected. These considerations apply also to criminal proceedings.

However, personal data processed by the controller in the present case were mugshots, namely pictures taken exclusively for police purposes. The DPA claimed that the spread of such images by police officers was unlawful in itself. As a consequence, processing of these personal data by a newspaper could not be considered in compliance with the GDPR. The DPA also held that the mere lack of identification numbers on the pictures did not reduce the potential risks for data subjects’ rights, as the pictures were published contextually to the data subjects’ arrest.

In light of the above, the DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and adopted a ban on further processing operations pursuant to Article 58(2)(f) GDPR. However, the DPA held that the adoption of a fine was not necessary and only issued a reprimand to the controller (Article 58(2)(b) GDPR).",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5
"The Italian DPA investigated the Italian company Problem Solving s.r.l. (the Company) after having adopted a decision against the telephone company Vodafone Italia S.p.A. in November 2020. The DPA made an information request to the Company to which the Company replied on 5 November 2021.

The Company acted as a telesales partner of Vodafone, and acquired lists containing contact details from third party providers to further communicate the lists to Vodafone. The agreement between Vodafone and the Company was about the execution of outbound and inbound call management services for the promotion of commercial campaigns. The agreement did not mention the activity of acquiring lists of contact details on behalf of Vodafone.

The Company acquired contact lists containing approximately 4,300,000 personal data and communicated them to Vodafone between 2019 and 2020. The lists were acquired from third parties, Ad-Opera s.r.l. and BR Pharma s.r.l. The initial list provider was Ad-Opera s.r.l. which the Company chose to replace in 2020 with BR Pharma s.r.l. The latter was deemed more fit to raise the quality level of the Company’s activities.

During the investigation, the Company claimed that it did not have any decision-making role on the use of any lists and viewed Vodafone as the controller. Vodafone, it argued, only allowed the use of the lists after a rigorous verification procedure. The Company argued that it uploaded the contact details on the ""Vodafone Deduplica Liste"" system, in order to obtain ""validation"" from Vodafone and to act in compliance with the will and purposes of Vodafone which the Company held was the controller. The Company also highlighted that it did not proceed to any further use of the lists of contact details in question.

The DPA established that the company acquired approximately 4,300,000 personal data from Ad-Opera and BR Pharma, which the Company then had communicated to Vodafone for the purpose of carrying out promotional campaigns. The DPA considered this as carrying out a transfer between independent controllers.

The DPA initiated the proceedings against the Company on 11 March 2022, in which it challenged the Company for several violations. First, (i) violation of Article 13 GDPR, by not informing the data subjects included in the Ad-Opera and Br Pharma’s lists about the data sharing with Vodafone Second, infringement of Articles 5(1)(a), 6 and 7, for having disclosed the data referred to in point (i) above without the data subjects’ prior consent.

The Company then submitted a defence statement and requested a hearing.

The Company had provided information notices of the third party list providers to the DPA which the DPA had analysed. During the hearing, the Company provided a new information notice and exhibited e-mails with Vodafone. The Company argued that on the basis of the new information notice and the e-mail exchange, it was clear Vodafone had acknowledged its role of being the sole controller.

The Company argued that it had always acted as Vodafone's intermediary and processor, even during the phase of the acquisition of the lists of personal data. It also referred to the content of the EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor under the GDPR, highlighting that such concepts are ""functional rather than formal"". Also during the hearing, the Company highlighted its constant attention to the aspects related to the protection of personal data, with constant verifications that it always brought to Vodafone's attention.

The Company saw that the processing of personal data for the purpose of acquiring new personal data lists was part of the complex of processing operations aimed at the promotional contact of potential customers, processing for which Vodafone was unquestionably the sole controller. The Company represented that it carried out the activities only in the interest of Vodafone, without any autonomous business assessment.","The DPA did not consider the Company’s arguments convincing to exclude its liability. The DPA referred to its initial investigation in 2020 where it established that the Company had acted as an independent controller in the processing of personal data connected to the acquisition of lists from third parties (list providers).

In its initial investigation the DPA pointed out that the Company has a twofold activity. The first activity consists of the acquisition of lists from third party providers, where the DPA considered the Company as an independent controller. The second activity was seen typically of a promotional nature and consisting contacting the persons included in the contact lists acquired (and authorised by Vodafone) to promote the services of Vodafone, where the DPA considered the Company as the processor of Vodafone.

The DPA also noted that the contract between the Company and Ad-Opera did not mention that the company purchased the lists on behalf of Vodafone. Moreover, according to the Italian DPA,  the object of the contract between the Company and Br Pharma, the supply of ""business consulting services”, was vague and undefined. This revealed that the Company acted as the first person in formalising the mutual obligations with the list providers, and also expanded its own operational perimeter, for the benefit of itself and certainly not Vodafone.

The DPA also viewed that the procedure of replacing the previous list supplier with the one contracted in 2020 showed that the Company acted on its own, on the basis of autonomous company assessments.

The DPA confirmed its observations made in the main investigation and affirmed the Company’s liability, as the Company acquired the lists of personal data by autonomously entering into contact with such third parties, signing the relevant contracts that, in the case of Br Pharma, also had a broader scope than the communication of the data, directly acquiring the lists and then transferring them to the system, owned by Vodafone which the DPA considered this a ""double transfer"" of the data.

As a result, the DPA found the Company to violate Article 13, 5(1)(a), 6, and 7 GDPR. The DPA imposed a fine of €54,609, equal to 2% of the Company's turnover, and prohibited the company from any further processing of the data acquired from the third party list providers.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 13, Article 28"
"A news report revealed that the flight attendants working for Icelandair were required to evaluate each other at work. This led the Icelandic DPA to open an investigation on the compliance of that mechanism with GDPR. On 19 May 2022, the DPA informed Icelandair of the investigation and invited it to provide explanation.

Icelandair explained that it ran an app called Crew App containing a possibility to evaluate the performance of colleagues. It works in the following way: 45 minutes after landing, the app announces that the performance evaluation is open. Flight attendants can then submit evaluation for 48 hours. This evaluation includes a grade from 1 to 5 with a written justification and text boxes where it is possible to enter text. The employees can consult their own average evaluation in the program only if they participated in performance evaluation of others.

The company explained that the purpose of the evaluation was to make employees aware of their performance. It also argued that the collective agreement between Icelandair and the Flight Attendants Association of Iceland stated among other things that performance must be taken into account when offering promotions and management positions. Therefore, regarding the legal basis, Icelandair stated (1) to have a legitimate interest in the performance evaluation and (2) that it is necessary to perform a contractual obligation arising from the collective agreement with the Flight Attendants Association. Finally, the company stated that the processing met the transparency requirements: the staff received a detailed introduction to use the app and could request access to their data under Article 15 GDPR.

The company also believed that it was not obliged to carry out a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 GDPR due to the nature of the processing: assessment and grading. It considered that this processing could not be seen as systematic or on a large scale of special categories of personal data since the data were provided only on a voluntary basis, whenever the employees decided to enter it.","Concerning the legal basis, the DPA held that under national law, the collective agreement between the company and the Flight Attendant Association could not be considered as a contract but was closer to a legal obligation. The contractual obligation was therefore not a valid legal basis. The DPA therefore assessed if the processing was necessary to fulfill a legal obligation and considered that the necessity condition was missing. Indeed, other mechanisms could have been set in place to collect staff evaluation.

The DPA also examined the compliance of the processing with the principles set out in Article 5(1) GDPR. Regarding the accuracy principle, the DPA considered that the fact that the staff evaluates each other’s performance, knowing that this evaluation plays a role in their promotions, could incentivise to provide negative or false reviews.

Concerning the minimization, the DPA considered the processing as “quite extensive”. Since the staff could provide evaluation for each flight, the amount of personal data collected could be considerable depending on how active the employees were. Regarding the necessity, the DPA held that there could be less intrusive ways to collect the evaluation than after every flight.

Finally, the DPA assessed the need for a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 GDPR. Taking into account the considerable amount of data and the fact that the flight attendants could evaluate each other after each flight, the DPA considered that it constituted systematic and extensive evaluation. Therefore, Icelandair should have conducted an impact assessment prior to the processing.

The DPA concluded that Icelandair did not demonstrate its respect of Article 5(1)(a) and (c) GDPR and should have conducted an impact assessment under Article 35 GDPR and ordered it to comply with the requirements and to send a description of the measures taken for such.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 15, Article 35"
"In the context of some processing operations already subject to investigation, the Italian DPA found that some controllers outsourced marketing services to Razmataz Live s.r.l. - a company active in the field of promotion of cultural activities. Razmataz relied in turn on another company, Flowers R, for the actual sending of marketing communications.

Since Razmataz did not reply to the supervisory authority's request of information, in May 2022 the DPA notified to the company the opening of a sanctioning procedure against it.

In its submission Razmataz claimed that the company did not assume any data protection role, as the marketing communications were sent by Flowers R according to the instructions directly issued by Razmataz's clients. Razmataz merely established a connection between Flowers R and such clients. Indeed, Razmataz did not have access to the contact details of the recipients of the marketing messages.","The Italian DPA rejected the arguments of the submission. According to the materials submitted by Razmataz, the latter played a key role in ensuring the communications between its clients and Flowers R in the context of the marketing campaigns. Indeed, Razmataz considered that Flowers R could provide its customers with adequate assistance in launching promotional campaigns. Razmataz was the channel of communication between the clients - acting as data controllers - and Flowers R the company that actually processed personal data.

Therefore, Razmataz acted as data processor and did not conduct appropriate checks on the level of data protection guaranteed by the sub-processor Flowers R. This triggered a violation of Articles 5 and 28 GDPR. Since the data processor is fully liable to the controller for the performance of a sub-processor’s obligations, Razmataz was liable for the non-compliant marketing campaigns run by Flowers R. These campaigns indeed resulted in an unlawful processing of personal data and in a violation of Article 6 GDPR, as data subjects' consent was not collected in advance.

Pursuant to Article 83 GDPR, the Italian DPA fined Razmataz €1,000. In determining the amount of the fine, the authority took into account the broad scope of the processing involving a large number of data subjects; the negligence of the conduct, in not responding to the request of information sent by the DPA; and the lack of measures to mitigate or eliminate the consequences of the violation. However, the DPA also considered a number of mitigating factors, including: the absence of previous infringements; the nature of the personal data at stake (in particular the lack of special categories of data); the complex financial situation in the country following the pandemic; and the limited turnover of the company.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 28"
"The controller was a Budapest-based company that operated the Spandora Beauty Centre, where facial and body treatments and medical aesthetic procedures were performed. The controller also distributed cosmetic products.

The DPA received several notifications in which clients and employees of the controller complained about cameras recording image and sound in all premises (offices, treatment rooms, corridors, reception) at its headquarters.

The DPA launched an official investigation on 19 October 2021 and carried out an on-site visit on 20 October 2021. The main issues arising from the very detailed investigation can be summarized as follows:

First, the cameras were monitoring the room where the staff eats, the training rooms and customer treatment rooms (implying that clients were often seen in incomplete clothing). The purpose of this processing was however not clearly defined nor communicated.

Second, the controller explained that only a few specific people had access to the recordings. However, the on-site visit showed that the camera images were also seen by the sales manager, who used them to check that the staff was communicating properly with the clients. The recordings were available on a computer in an unlocked room. To access them, one could click on a shortcut and enter a username which was written on a piece of paper stuck to the monitor.

Third, all clients had to fill in and sign a consultation form which mentioned the placement of cameras for the purpose of protecting clients and staff. It however did not mention the recording of audio. The investigation also showed that there was no mention of the cameras in the privacy notice in force.

Fourth, the controller stored health data in the client database, including Covid vaccination status, pregnancy, and sicknesses.

Fifth, the controller stated that the signature of the consultation form constituted a consent to the processing of their data for a marketing purpose. Later, the controller held that this processing was based on legitimate interest, and then in a further contradictory declaration, it stated that it did not use client data for such purposes","The DPA assessed the compliance of the monitoring in the light of the different elements of the investigation.

First, the DPA stated that the monitoring was performed for an unclear purpose and without settings that minimized the processing. The controller referred to the purposes in general terms and with contradictory statements. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the controller had breached the purpose limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR. The DPA, therefore, prohibited the processing of data by the camera in operators and in diagnostic and examination rooms and instructed the controller to delete in a documented manner the video recordings made in operators and in diagnostic and examination rooms.

Second, Regarding the people who could access the cameras, the DPA found that the controller did not guarantee the confidentiality of the data processing and did not take measures to protect personal data. Indeed, the images of the cameras and the stored recordings could be easily accessed. The DPA found that by failing to provide the default settings for the operation of the camera system that minimize data processing, the means necessary to ensure the highest possible level of protection of personal data, the controller violated Article 5(1) GDPR in Article 24 GDPR and Article 25 GDPR, as well as Article 32(1)(b) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR, and instructed the controller to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that its processing operations comply with the legal provisions.

Third, concerning the information, the DPA found that the privacy notice did not comply with the requirements of the GDPR as it did not provide information on the location of each camera and its purpose, the area or object it monitored, or whether the employer was carrying out direct or fixed surveillance with the camera. It also did not provide for the specific duration of the storage of the recordings, the rules for viewing the recordings, or the purposes for which the recordings could be used by the employer. The consultation forms could not either be considered as compliant since they contained misleading information. The controller therefore didn't comply with the requirement of transparent processing under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and Article 13(1) and (2).  The DPA instructed the controller to provide adequate, clear, and transparent information to data subjects about all processing.

Fourth, regarding the collection and storage of health data, the DPA recalled that the processing of sensitive data is possible if the data subject has given his or her explicit consent or if the processing complies with Article 9(2) GDPR. In this case, the controller neither demonstrated that the processing of certain health data was indispensable for the performance of the services nor to have collected a valid consent. Thus, the DPA found that the controller had violated Article 6 GDPR and Article 9(2) GDPR and prohibited the processing of the health data and to delete the personal health data from the records.

Fifth, the DPA found that there was no checkbox on the consultation form to consent to the processing for marketing purposes. The clients therefore did not consent to the processing for this purpose. The controller also failed to demonstrate a legitimate interest. The DPA concluded that, as the controller processed the data for marketing purposes without a legal basis, it had breached Article 6(1) GDPR in relation to this processing. For these reasons, the DPA instructed the controller to cease the unlawful processing and to bring the processing operation into compliance with the legal provisions by justifying the legal basis for the processing of the guests' data for marketing purposes.

Taking into account that the controller had not previously committed GDPR violations and that it implemented compliance measures, the DPA ordered a fine of HUF30,000,000 (approx. €80,000).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32"
"The controller – Ediscom S.p.A. – was a marketing company whose business consisted in contacting potential customers on behalf of third vendors through sms, emails and automated calls. In order to conduct this activity, the company made use of an extensive database including contact details of more than 21 million people. Personal data were collected both directly by Ediscom and by third parties. In general, Ediscom acknowledged to act as a controller. However, in some cases, Ediscom rented databases from third parties with an aim of monetising them. Although costs and profits were shared, Ediscom considered itself a processor on behalf of the owners of such databases.

Ediscom regularly received withdrawals of consent and erasure requests. As Ediscom relied on several databases with partial overlap of data, it usually put these requests in blacklists in order to avoid to reimport the same data from another source – and use them again. Whenever it considered to operate as a processor, Ediscom notified the original controller about erasure or withdrawal of consent requests.

Some data subjects claimed to have objected to the processing for marketing purposes. However, they still received calls and messages from Ediscom. In the context of these complaints, the Italian DPA started a broader investigation about the Ediscom’s business practices. The investigation concerned both the websites used by the controller to directly collect personal data and personal data disclosed to Ediscom by third parties.

On several websites managed by the Ediscom, users were invited to take part to lotteries or to subscribe to cooking or health newsletters. Theoretically, users could choose whether the Ediscom was allowed to use and share their data for marketing purposes. In practice, the supervisory authority identified numerous GDPR violations.

Several GDPR infringements could also be found with regard to personal data originally collected by third parties.","Data directly collected by the controller

The DPA found that the websites managed by Ediscom made large use of prohibited dark patterns in the collection of consent. Typically, once the user had already denied their consent to marketing purposes, a new window popped up asking again for the same consent. Moreover, when exploring some of the websites, users had the option to click on a link which brought them to another website managed by Ediscom. In clicking on the link, the data subject imported all their data to the second website, where consent denied in the first one was automatically given. For these reasons, the DPA identified violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1)(a), 7(2) and 25 GDPR.

Data collected by the websites were also excessive in light of purpose limitation and data minimisation. As a matter of fact, Ediscom asked a lot of unnecessary questions, such as users’ annual income, family status or job. Some of these questions were mandatory, while in other cases the option to ignore or skip them was not clearly visible. According to the supervisory authority, such a technique was clearly used to profile data subjects in lack of specific consent for targeted advertising. Therefore, Articles 5(1)(a) to (c), 6 and 7 GDPR were violated.

In one of the websites examined, there was no privacy policy and no statement concerning the identity of the controller. This entailed a violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13 GDPR.

Finally, Ediscom asked the user to provide personal data of “friends” potentially interested in the same services. These questions concerning unaware third data subjects, despite not mandatary, could not rely on any valid legal basis and consequently violated Articles 6 and 14 GDPR.

Data collected through the sharing of third parties’ databases

Concerning the role played by Ediscom in the processing of data obtained from third parties, the Italian DPA found that its self-qualification as a data processor was inappropriate. Indeed, the company determined purposes and means of the processing even when managing third parties’ databases. Moreover, when denying its responsibility as a controller, Ediscom did not allow users to exercise their rights under Articles 17 and 21 GDPR, with the result that data subjects that already objected to the processing – at first put in a blacklist – were contacted again because in a third party’s database. Ediscom claimed it could not comply with the data subjects’ requests and merely shifted responsibility on a different company, which in turn denied to be the controller.

The DPA also found that the control performed by Ediscom on the lists provided by third parties was not adequate. Such a control should guarantee that consent on which processing relied was valid. However, among other deficiencies, Ediscom chose to rely only on IP addresses provided by third parties in order to ascertain that consent was validly collected. A more effective option – the DPA stressed – would have been to rely on confirmation emails sent by the original controller to the people involved. In any case, the complaints from which the investigation originally started showed that Ediscom’s control did not achieve its goal. Thus, the controller infringed Articles 5(2) and 24 GDPR.

In light of all the above, the Italian DPA fined Ediscom €300.000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 13, Article 14, Article 24, Article 25"
"The controller - an individual - installed cameras in a public toilet. The system had a sensor that activated cameras and started recording as soon as a person entered the monitored area. A criminal investigation started against the controller. When asked why he decided to install the cameras, the controller claimed to have a “technical interest”: indeed, they needed to test the cameras. They specifically targeted public toilets because this decision had “a certain appeal of the illicit”.

Notified by the police in the context of the criminal proceeding, the Austrian DPA opened a second investigation.

The controller claimed to have erased the data and not to have disclosed the data to third parties. Moreover, the controller pointed out that people appearing in the video recordings were not identifiable. Consequently, processing did not involve personal data and the GDPR did not apply, according to the controller.","The Austrian DPA stressed that, even if personal data were not disclosed to third parties, according to CJEU case law (see C-212/13), video recording of public space is not covered by the household exemption under Article 2(2)(c) GDPR. Therefore, the GDPR applied to the case at issue.

In terms of legal basis, “technical interest” of the controller could theoretically be thought as a special kind of legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. In practice, it could hardly argued by the controller that such an interest was really “legitimate”. In any case, processing was not necessary to achieve the goal stated by the controller and by no means able to prevail in the balancing with data subjects’ rights. Thus, the processing had no legal basis and was unlawful.

Moreover, the controller violated their transparency obligations under Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, as they did not display the appropriate informative signs.

In light of the above, the DPA fined the controller €25.000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 2, Article 6"
"The controller, Tensa Art Design SA, was an optician and merchant for glasses, sunglasses as well as contact lenses. As part of its business the controller was sending commercial messages.

A data subject, objected to receiving the commercial messages as foreseen by Article 21 GDPR, by unsubscribing from the newsletter service. Yet, the controller continued to send commercial communications to the data subject's phone number via SMS in a frequent manner. Consequently, the data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, prompting the DPA to investigate the matter.","The DPA held that the controller's conduct was a violation of the GDPR. Pursuant to Article 21 GDPR data subjects have the right to object to processing which is done based either on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR (public interest) or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest). Moreover, Article 21(2) GDPR specifically grants data subjects the right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes.

During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller did not present evidence from which it could be concluded that it reacted to the request of the data subject in accordance with Article 12(3) GDPR and Article 21 GDPR and did not provide the data subject with an answer, within the month of the request, regarding the measures adopted following the exercise of the right to objection.

The DPA decided that the controller violated Article 12(3) and Article 21 GDPR by not respecting the data subject's objection. Based on its powers pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) GDPR, the DPA fined the controller €1,000 (RON 4,947.9).

These notifications were mentioning that Salvati Romania Union Party (in Romanian: Partidul Salvati Romania  - USR), the controller, published on its website personal data belonging to several data subjects. These data included the data subjects' degrees of disability.

Following such, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. It revealed that the data controller operator collected the personal data  i.e. name, surname, personal numerical code (a unique 13 digits number assigned to Romanians and Romanian residents), address, identity card number, medical certificate number, degree of disability, from official documents of authorities and public institutions and later published them on the party's website, as part of a project.","The Romanian DPA found that the data controller could not rely on any legal basis for the processing at stake. It therefore violated the provisions of Article 5(1)(a) and (b) in conjunction with Article 6 GDPR.

"The case initiated from a complaint made by a data subject who filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA requesting the DPA to declare that a controller - a company providing accommodation services - within the neighbouring property unlawfully processes personal data with its surveillance camera systems (CCTV). The data subject requested the DPA to 1) prohibit the controller from monitoring the data subject's property with its CCTV systems, and 2) to order the controller to terminate the unlawful recordings.

The DPA extended the scope of the investigation (ex officio) against the controller. The DPA investigated all processing activities carried out by the controller with its CCTV systems and conducted an on-site inspection to the controller's property. The controller was using two CCTV systems that were identified within the investigation as Camera system No. 1 (consisting of 4 analogue cameras only providing live image) and Camera system No. 2 (consisting of 4 IP cameras recording image and audio) for which the recordings were said to be stored for three days by the controller.

The Camera system No. 1 showed views of the parking area within the property of the controller, a view from the gate to the building and to the reception area, and a small part of the backyard of the property, with a pavement leading to the reception area. The DPA noted that there were no recreational facilities located in these areas. The controller stated that the purposes of the CCTV in Camera sytem No. 1 were: 1) the protection of persons and property, 2) to detect possible infringements, 3) to catch a perpetrator in the act, and 4) to prevent infringing acts. The controller relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing.

With regard to Camera system No. 2 showed views of: 1) a dining room, 2) a panoramic jacuzzi on the terrace - which previously showed a view of the data subject's property, but at the time of the DPA's on-site investigation, the controller had modified the angle view of the camera away from the data subject's property - 3) a patio, and 4) a reception desk.  These cameras were motion-activated, recorded images, and some of them were placed with an angle of view to areas where the persons not only pass through but also rest and dine. Regardless of the DPA's request, the controller did not present any previous cases justifying the necessity for the use of the CCTV. The DPA considered that it was relevant whether any events had taken place in the past which would justify the placement of the cameras, as the data processing was more extensive compared to Camera system No 1. With regard to the previous monitoring of the data subject's property, the controller argued that it had had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f), because it had legitimate interests for property protection purposes as it had accused the data subject’s husband for vandalism towards the fence separating the two properties.","With regard to the Camera system No. 1 the DPA concluded that the operation of the cameras is appropriate for the purposes pursued and a necessary security measure for the objective pursued by the controller. Additionally, the DPA viewed that because the cameras within Camera system No. 1 only transmitted live image, and did not record any images that it constituted a significantly lower intrusion into the privacy of the persons concerned than if the video images were recorded.

With regard to Camera system No. 2, the DPA considered that due to the more extensive monitoring carried out by the cameras, it was necessary to assess each camera separately. The controller's balancing of interests test lacked individual assessments of the cameras, and only included general wording such as that valuable objects are monitored, so the interest of the controller is to safeguard the mentioned objects.

The objectives and purposes pursued by the controller for each camera were unclear to the DPA. The DPA also took in consideration the fact that the controller had not examined any alternative(s) for the use of a CCTV system that would not involve processing or the processing would be more limited in scope. The DPA emphasized, that in order to use CCTV systems on the basis of a legitimate interest, the processing must be proportionate to the aim pursued and compatible with the purposes pursued, necessary to achieve the purpose, and the design and implementation of the processing must take into account the reasonable expectations of the data subjects. Secondly, the DPA emphasized that the legitimate interests must be real and present at the time when the processing starts because processing cannot be based on a possible future interests.

With regard to the Camera system No. 2 recording also audio, the DPA viewed that the controller had not presented any reasons which would justify the necessity of audio recording, and emphasized that it is not a common practice in the case of CCTV surveillance of property. The DPA stated that data subjects cannot expect the cameras recording their voice and conversations, in particularly, when the cameras could also be activated by some small non-human movement and so start recording the conversations of persons who are not even in the camera's view (the DPA found examples of such situations from the CCTV recordings during its investigation).

The DPA furthermore found regarding Camera system No. 2, that the controller did not have legitimate interests for processing the personal data and held that the controller violated Article 6(1) GDPR with regard to 1) the camera installed in the dining room, 2) the camera monitoring the panoramic jacuzzi on the terrace, and 3) the camera facing the patio. With regard to 4) the camera above the reception desk, the DPA found that the controller had legitimate interests that were the protection of property and monitoring of cash payments. The DPA considered the previous monitoring of the data subject’s property as a serious interference with private life, and that only in very rare situations can there be legitimate interests that are not overruled. The DPA took in consideration, that the balancing of interests -test did not include the data subject’s property – only the controller’s property.

The Hungarian DPA held, firstly, that the controller 1) had unlawfully processed personal data of the data subject who initially complained about the processing in breach of Article 6(1) GDPR. The DPA also prohibited the controller under 58(2)(f) GDPR from monitoring, in the future, the data subject's property. Secondly, the DPA held that the controller infringed 2) the principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR by not taking any measures to ensure that the recordings were deleted after set limitation of 3 days, 3) Article 12(1) GDPR by failing to inform the data subjects on the use of the camera surveillance in an easily accessible way, 4) Article 13 GDPR by failing to provided adequate information about the processing, 5) Article 31 GDPR by failing to comply with its duty to cooperate with the DPA as, in the DPA's view, the controller did not cooperate with the Authority during the procedure to the extent necessary, and in several cases provided false, incorrect or incomplete information.

"In April 2021, more than 1 year after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Police of the Czech Republic began a wide collection of data on the health status of people infected with the coronavirus. The aim was to monitor compliance with isolation orders and prevent the spread of contagion. Until March 2022, sensitive data of approximately 2 million people were processed by the Ministry of the Interior. Upon becoming aware of the fact, the Czech DPA initiated an investigation into possible violations of data protection regulations.","After its investigation, the Czech DPA concluded that the police carried out a general large scale collection of data, since the activity was not related to specific situations. For this reason, it held that the Ministry of the Interior exceeded its police powers. The DPA emphasized that public powers must be exercised within the limits of the law - a limitation that applies even in extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic. It recalled that the law that regulates police action in Czech Republic does not authorize the mass collection of sensitive data. Therefore, it held that the data processing lacked a legal basis.

The DPA further emphasized that, even when there is a legal basis for data processing, the controller must comply with its obligations under the GDPR. One of these obligations is to provide adequate information to data subjects so that they can exercise their rights, including the right to object to the processing of their personal data. In the case at hand, the DPA found that the Ministry of the Interior failed to provide sufficient information about data processing.

Finally, the DPA noted that the systematic processing of such a large set of sensitive data requires the performance of a data protection impact assessment under the advice of a data protection officer. This assessment must consider the risks that the processing raises to data subjects and the necessary measures to mitigate these risks. In the DPA's opinion, if the Ministry had carried out this assessment, it would have come to the conclusion that such blanket collection of personal health data should not be performed at all.

When the data subject asked the controller about the origin of the personal data, the controller was unable to specifically indicate to the data subject the source from which it had acquired the personal data.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Italian DPA claiming they never gave their consent to receive marketing communication. Moreover, the data subject claimed that the controller had been evasive in responding to the request concerning the origin of the personal data.

During the investigation, the controller stated that it had acquired a list of names and numbers that could be contacted for the purpose of marketing from a third party telemarketing company. The third party telemarketing company guaranteed that the names and the numbers on the list could be used for marketing purposes. The controller shared the list with both the Italian DPA and the data subject.","At the end of the preliminary investigation, the Italian DPA found that the controller violated the following GDPR provisions:

* Articles 5(1), 6(1) and 7 GDPR for acquiring personal data from a third party for marketing purposes without previously checking if consent was validly given. The absolute good faith in the guarantees that the third party offered was not considered sufficient by the supervisory authority. The DPA held that the data controller did not take any precaution in acquiring the data from the third party nor took steps to demonstrate the lawfulness of the processing. The DPA further elaborated that, while relying on the professional guarantees offered by the third party, the controller failed to use its control power. In fact, the controller did not request from the third party the documentation proving the lawfulness of the processing, such as the origin of the data, the information provided to the data subjects and the consent obtained from the data subjects, nor did the controller carry out such checks in another way.
* Also, the controller violated the same norms by unlawfully communicating information on other data subjects present in the personal data list to the data subject.
* Articles 13 and 14 GDPR for not providing the data subjects, whose data were acquired by the third party, with information in relation to the processing of their data for marketing purposes.
* Articles 12 and 15 GDPR, for not having provided the data subject with a complete reply to the request to exercise the right of access. In particular, the controller did not provide the information concerning the origin of the data to the data subject until the intervention of the DPA. In this way, the data subject could not exercise the right of access.

However, the controller only informed one of the data subjects - the one whose personal data were on the notarial deed. It also failed to notify the Polish DPA as required by Article 33(1) GDPR.

In October 2020, the Polish DPA received an anonymous tip informing about this incident. The DPA started an investigation and requested information from the controller, including the number of affected data subjects and categories of data which had been stolen. The controller alleged that it had orally informed the data subjects about the data breach and that it was not aware that the DPA had to be notified as well. Additionally, the controller reported that it did not conclude a data processing agreement with the notarial firm (the processor) who prepared the deed.","First, the DPA recalled that Article 33(1) GDPR obliges the controller to inform the DPA of any personal data breach within 72 hours, unless there is a small or no risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. In this case, the DPA noted that the stolen personal data could be used by an unauthorised third party to commit identity fraud. Hence, the DPA considered that there was a high risk to the rights of data subjects and found that the controller violated Article 33(1) GDPR by failing to inform the DPA of the data breach.

The SSI receives and analyses biological samples taken from patients (for example blood samples) for diagnostic analysis purposes which is done as part of the institute's exercise of authority pursuant to Section 222 of the Danish Health Act. In addition, SSI processes other information about the person (e.g. the person’s name and ID number). After a diagnostic analysis has been carried out, often resulting excess biological material is stored in Denmark's National Biobank for future research purposes. The SSI argued that the exception under Article 14(5)(b) of said information obligations applies, as informing would require a disproportionately large effort in the form of large administrative and financial costs. The SSI's laboratory information system is over 20 years old and does not currently support automatic notifications which means that the SSI would need to inform individuals manually.

Additionally, the SSI viewed that the concerned persons’ interests were covered by making general information about the collection available online on their websites.

With regard to storing data in the national biobank for further research purposes, the SSI argued that the processing is compliant with the GDPR, as the further processing is not seen incompatible with the original processing purposes pursuant to Article 5(1)(b) GDPR.","The Danish DPA made the assessment separately regarding when the SSI a) received biological samples for analysis and b) where residual material is stored in the national biobank.

Firstly, the DPA considered that a balancing of interests must be done when assessing whether compliance with the obligation to provide information can be considered to require a disproportionately large effort under Article 14(5)(b) GDPR. The balance must be made on the one hand, the significance of such notification and, on the other hand, the work effort of the controller that will be associated with such notification.

The DPA emphasized that the difficulties SSI had stated did not relate to challenges in identifying the data subjects due to, for example, missing or outdated contact information. Therefore, the said difficulties are not caused by the fact that SSI has not collected the information from the data subjects.

Based an overall assessment, the DPA found that the SSI cannot fail to fulfill its obligation to provide information pursuant to Article 14(1) and 14(3) GDPR with reference to Article 14(5)(b), when the receiving samples for the diagnostic analysis purposes. Secondly, the DPA considered that further processing for a new purpose, which is compatible with the original one, does not constitute an exception to the controller's information obligation, which follows from Article 14(4), which precisely regulate the controller's fulfillment of the obligation to provide information, where further processing is carried out for a new and compatible purpose.

In practice, this meant that a student – knowingly or unknowingly (e.g. as a result of mistyping the URL) – could complete a test set up by a teacher from another school. In this case, the teacher from another school would gain unauthorised access to the student's personal data (name, email and test results).

The DPA emphasised that access through URLs must take place in a way that ensures the confidentiality of personal data.

The DPA viewed that a service clearly aiming to process and evaluate personal data about professional ability places great demands on the processor's design of their technical solution.

"In the aftermath of the Schrems I and II judgements (C-362/14 and C-311/18), the Irish DPA started an ex office procedure into the issue of Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. (Meta Ireland) transferring personal data to Meta Platforms Inc. (Meta U.S.) in violation of Chapter V of the GDPR.

Meta Ireland had been transferring personal data to the U.S. despite the lack of a valid adequacy decision under Article 45 GDPR (as both “safe harbor” and its successor “privacy shield” were invalidated by the CJEU in Schrems I and II).

While negotiation of a new adequacy decision for EU-U.S. data transfers are ongoing, Meta Ireland claimed to have undertaken data transfers on the basis of standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission under Article 46(2)(c) GDPR even before the CJEU passed the Schrems II decision.","First, the Irish DPA ascertained whether US law guaranteed an essentially equivalent level of protection of data protection rights in light of Schrems II. This was excluded by the supervisory authority, especially due to the lack of effective judicial remedies against the violation of data subjects’ fundamental rights by U.S. intelligence agencies and due to the lack of limitations imposed on the latters’ investigation powers. The latest developments in U.S. law (which are supposed to ensure a higher level of protection for data transferred to the U.S.) were deemed insufficient by the Irish DPA, especially since some of the promised reforms have not yet been implemented.

Second, the Irish DPA found that Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) pursuant to Article 46(2)(c) GDPR invoked by Meta Ireland could not compensate for the lack of an equivalent level of data protection. In particular, SCCs did not (and could not) address the activity of U.S. intelligence agencies or the lack of judicial remedies against such activity.

Third, the supervisory authority considered whether Meta Ireland implemented sufficient supplementary measures that would, in addition to SSCs, ensure an equivalent level of data protection. Neither of the organisational, technical or legal measures Meta Ireland Ltd claimed to have implemented could compensate for a problem that stems from US public law.

Finally, Meta Ireland could not rely on derogations under Article 49 GDPR, as derogations to fundamental rights enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights shall be interpreted strictly. In this case, the Irish DPA found (following the CJEU in Schrems I and II) that U.S. law interfered with the essence of Europeans’ fundamental rights and therefore did not pass the test set out in Article 52 of the Charter. Moreover, according to the Irish DPC, derogations under Article 49 GDPR can only be invoked for “occasional and non-repetitive” transfers, which was clearly not the case with the Meta group, whose business model is based on massive and continuous transatlantic exchanges of data. As Meta Ireland could not rely on any legal basis for data transfers, it violated Chapter V of the GDPR. Therefore, the Irish DPA decided to use its corrective powers. With a draft decision in the context of an Article 60 GDPR cooperation mechanism, the DPA ordered Meta Ireland to suspend the transfer of personal data to the US pursuant to Article 58(2)(j) GDPR.

Nevertheless, the Irish DPA initially considered the imposition of a fine unnecessary and disproportionate. On the one hand, the Irish DPA found that the suspension of the transfers was already sufficient to enforce the GDPR and a fine on top of it would have been excessive. On the other hand, the Irish DPA claimed that several complex legal issues concerning data transfers were solved for the first time before the CJEU in the Schrems II judgement. Thus, the Irish DPA took the view that Meta Ireland acted in good faith when transferring data in lack of a proper legal basis. The Irish DPA also did not issue an order for the bulk return or erasure of all data transferred to the U.S. either, considering such a measure excessive, too.

Other DPAs disagreed with the Irish DPA’s draft decision and raised reasoned objections under Article 60(4) GDPR, which the Irish DPA did not want to accept. Consequently, the EDPB had to solve the conflict among the European DPAs under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.

First, the EDPB stated that the end of the storage of personal data in the US was also a necessary measure to bring the overall situation in compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR. Therefore, it requested the Irish DPA to adopt against Meta an order pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR. The EDPB also established a 6-months deadline in order for Meta to comply with this order.

The EDPB also forced the Irish DPA to fine Meta pursuant to Articles 58(2)(c) and 83 GDPR and to determine the amount of the fine in a way that such a measure was effectively dissuasive. Eventually, the Irish followed he orders by the EDPB and also adopted a €1,2 billion fine – the highest fine issued under the GDPR at this point. In its reasoning the Irish DPA copied large portions of the EDPB decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 45, Article 46, Article 49, Article 60, Article 65"
"Automobile Bavaria is a car seller (controller) suffered a data breach which resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of data of 290 data subjects. These data included names, surnames, email addresses, phone numbers, data related to their car, car purchase method and marketing options (telephone, email, newsletter registration…). Between July 2022 and 4 August 2022, due to the data breach, these data were publicly available on the controller’s website.

The controller notified the Romanian DPA of the data breach, which led the DPA to start an investigation. This investigation showed that the controller did not implement nor tested adequate security measures regarding the risk implied by the processing. It also showed that the controller did not implement adequate security measures at the time of establishing the means of the processing (privacy by design) and at the time of the processing itself (privacy by default).","The Romanian DPA found that the controller did not ensure the security of the data, in violation of Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR and warned the controller for a violation of Article 25(1) GDPR.

Because Google is a US-based service provider, personal data of the controller’s website visitors, such as IP address and other information that could be used to identify a data subject, were transmitted to the United States through the use of the Google services in question.

Following a website user first contacting the controller on the issue, the controller filed a data breach notification with the Finnish DPA in September 2022. According to the controller, the data breach started on 1 January 2010, and the number of data subjects affected was estimated to be 330 000. As a result, the controller disabled the Google services in question from it’s website in September 2022.

Pursuant to Article 44 GDPR, transfers of personal data to a third country can only take place if the controller and processor comply with the conditions set out in Chapter V GDPR.","The DPA cited the “Schrems II” decision (C-311/18) and held that the controller had infringed Articles 44 and 46 GDPR because 1) the controller had not established a lawful basis for the transfers in accordance with Chapter V GDPR and 2) nor had the controller put in place appropriate safeguards for the transfers. Therefore, the controller had unlawfully transferred personal data of its website visitors to the United States by using Google Analytics and reCAPTCHA services.

As a result, the DPA 1) issued a reprimand to the controller and 2) ordered the controller to delete all personal data that were transferred to the United States without a lawful basis. Because the controller had already disabled the Google services from its website, the DPA did not deem necessary to order the controller to do the same and to bring the processing into compliance with the GDPR.

Finally, the DPA highlighted that controllers cannot transfer their responsibility to data subjects by instructing data subjects, for example, to install a Google add-on on their browser to block the use of Google's tracking technologies, such as Google Analytics. The DPA added that Google add-on does not completely prevent the transmission of the data subject's data to Google, as it does not prevent the downloading of Google Analytics scripts from Google's servers.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 35, Article 44, Article 46"

"A data subject realised that their neighbour (controller) installed surveillance cameras that were monitoring their private garden. They considered that the monitoring was violating the Spanish data protection law (Art.22 LOPDGDD) in force.

The data subject therefore filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA.","The Spanish DPA recalled that image of a person, according to article 4.1 GDPR, is a personal data and its protection is, therefore, subject of this Regulation. The concept of ""processing"" of personal data is defined in Article 4.2 of the GDPR. Article 22 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish national data protection law: Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales BOE-A-2018-11673) sets out the specific rules for the processing of data for video surveillance purposes and stating that natural or legal persons, may carry out the processing of images through camera or video camera systems for the purpose of preserving the security of persons and property, as well as of their installations. However, images may only be captured from the public insofar as it is essential for these security reasons.

Against this background the DPA holds that Video cameras may not capture images of persons who are outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since the processing of images in public places can only be carried out by the Security Forces and Corps.

In the prersent case, the DPA found that there were no security reasons that justified the monitoring of a private garden.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5"
"In February 2021, the Italian Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) informed the Italian DPA that two related companies, MAS S.R.L. and MAS S.R.L.S., were engaging in door-to-door marketing and ilegally using personal data to promote and offer contracts with electric companies.

Initially, the DPA opened an investigation only against the two companies. However, the investigations revealed a complex system of direct and indirect contractual relationships, with two companies in the energy sector as final recipients of said marketing services: HERA COMM and ENEL ENERGIA.

Operating as part of that system, MAS S.R.L.S. first bought personal data bases from an Italian and a Spanish company and also from an unidentified vendor on Facebook. Then, together with MAS S.R.L., it processed these data for door-to-door marketing on behalf of the electric companies, without telling consumers that they were mere intermediaries. Additionally, the companies did not tell them how they collected their personal data.

Moreover, MAS S.R.L. and MAS S.R.L.S. shared the collected personal data with telemarketing companies SESTA IMPRESA and ARNIA, that further processed the data for telephone advertising. During the investigation, no proof of consumer consent was provided.

The DPA also found that SESTA IMPRESA got the credentials to access ENEL's infromation systems and shared them with ARNIA. In turn, ARNIA used these credentials to upload the signed contracts into the system without authorization from ENEL. None of the telemarketing companies had a written contract with ENEL appointing them as processors.

Although ARNIA had been appointed as a processor by SESTA in 2019, none of the other companies had signed data processing  or joint controllership agreements. They were also not appointed as processors or sub-processors by other intermediaries nor by the final customers HERA COMM and ENEL.

The DPA also verified that the marketing activities involved a large number of consumers as ARNIA uploaded 260.000 contracts between 2018 and 2022.  While ARNIA presented a purely procedural defense, the other investigated companies decided to not defend themselves at all.","In its decision, the DPA highlighted the absolute lack of collaboration of the companies with the investigations. It then emphasized that the investigations revealed the functioning of a marketing industry based on a series of illegal practices. According to the DPA,  these companies were passing personal data from hand to hand without consumers being aware of it without contractually defining their responsibilities in this data sharing network.

With regard to company MAS S.R.L., the DPA found that, in addition to processing personal data for advertising purposes without providing consumers with prior information and obtaining their specific consent, it got them to sign contracts on behalf of ENEL, without having signed a processor agreement. Besides, it shared the data contained in the contracts with SESTA, with whom it also had no written agreement. Therefore, it considered MAS S.R.L. as independent controller since Article 6(1)(b) GDPR only allows the parties to the contract to process personal data necessary for the performance of that contract.

The same reasoning was applied in relation to company MAS S.R.L.S., that shared the data with the latter, operating in the exact same environment and having the exact same personnel working indifferently for both companies.

As for the company SESTA, the DPA pointed out that, although there was a contract signed with ENEL, such contract did not qualify it as a processor. Therefore, it carried out personal data processing to promote electricity services in the absence of a mandate that would legitimize it to do so, acting as a de facto processor. Likewise, the numerous collaborators, both natural and legal persons, with which SESTA has shared the data were neither legitimized to process it.

Finally, regarding ARNIA, the DPA deemed its appointment as a processor by SESTA as ineffective. According to the DPA, this appointment did not correspond to the reality of the facts since SESTA carried out promotional activities as a de facto processor. It held that the only activity that ARNIA carried out under the controllership of SESTA and the other companies were the phone calls with potential customers. However, to make promotional calls, it used the same ilegally obtained database. The DPA then further emphasized that ARNIA ilegally accessed ENEL's IT platforms to perfom data entry operations without being entitled to use its authentication credentials. The DPA also held that ARNIA failed to adequately provide the resquested documents during the investigations.

The DPA concluded that there was a violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 6, 7 and 13, of the GDPR as well as Art. 130 of the Italian Privacy Code. Moreover, it considered that the lack of a written agreement violated Articles 28 and 29 GDPR and that the lack of records of the processing activities violated Article 30 GDPR. For theses reasons, it deemed the processing as 'radically ilegal' and orther the companies to stop it. Moreover, it ordered the confiscation of IT and paper files containing the the personal data illegally acquired by them in order to protect the large number of affected data subjects.

As a sanction for the violations, it imposed the following fines:

* MAS S.R.L. was fined €200,000 for violating Articles 5, 6, 7, 28, 29, and 30 GDPR as well as Art. 130(3) of the Italian Privacy Code;

"The Capitol's Emergency Service in Denmark (Hovedstadens Beredskab I/S) (the controller) reported a data breach to the Danish DPA after become aware of wide accessibility to HR data.

The data breach was reported after the controller became aware of the fact that its new electronic case & document management (ESDH) system allowed all employees to access of current and former employees' personal data. The data consisted the full names, social security numbers, and addresses, including protected addresses, of over 2000 persons. After a closer investigation, the controller stated that 6 users, who have accessed information about current or former employees, did not have a work-related need to access the information.

It appears from the controller's statement, that the controller, and the supplier of the ESDH system, both, were allegedly unaware of the fact that this information was accessible to all employees.

Following the reported data breach, the supplier started to plan for a solution, where it is possible, to ensure that only authorised users can search access the personal data in the ESDH system. Moreveover, the controller started conducting an analysis of how many and which types of users have a work-related need for access to the relevant information about current and former employees.","It follows from Article 32(1) that the controller has a duty to identify the risks that the controller's processing poses to the data subjects and to ensure that appropriate security measures are introduced to protect the data subjects against these risks.

The DPA held that Article 32 GDPR will normally mean that user access to systems should be limited to the personal data that is necessary for the work-related needs of the users in question. In this particular case, the DPA held that only employees in the controller's HR department needs access to the information in question.

Eventually, the DPA suggested to sanction the controller by expressing critisism for the controller's failure to ensure that technical and organisational measures were implemented pursuant to Article 32(1) GDPR.

The DPA took in consideration that the controller expects a change to be implemented in the ESDH system to limit access rights of users to ensure that only authorised users can search for personal data on current and former employees. Furthermore, the DPA noted that before the system changes are implemented, the controller checks the system logs on an ongoing basis, and that affected data subjects will be notified on an ongoing basis, if their information is accessed.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"Following a report by a trade union about video surveillance in multiple companies, in April 2022, the Italian Garante launched an investigation with the company H&M (controller) concerning the video surveillance systems in place at their registered office and in their stores.

* that all the controller’s shops were equipped with surveillance cameras;
* the video surveillance system was active 24 hours a day and that images were kept for 24 hours;
* in some of the shops, cameras were placed at employees’ entrance and in other areas reserved to the employees; and
* the processing concerned more than 500 employees.

The controller argued that the employees were informed of the presence of the cameras through information notices. It relied on a security and protection purpose and referred to an authorization of processing that would have been issued by a territorial Labor Inspectorate.

The controller also stated that only 543 employees out of a total of 4,300 were actually monitored and that the cameras were only monitoring an area of passage.","The Garante assessed if the processing was lawful within the meaning of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

According to Article 88 GDPR, the GDPR is applicable without prejudice to more protective national rules. In Italy, a national provision (Article 4 of the Law no. 300 of 1970) is more specific than the GDPR. It requires, in the context of an employment relationship, that the processing should be agreed upon in an agreement with the trade union representatives or authorized by the Labor Inspectorate. Contrary to the controller’s statement, in this case, the Garante found that no agreement nor authorization was in place.

The Garante held the fact that the cameras only monitored passage areas is not relevant since the monitoring of video surveillance is subject to the full application of data protection provisions. It added that even if 543 out of a total of 4,300 were concerned, it was still a high number of data subjects.

In view of the above, the Garante considered that the controller breached Articles 5(1)(a) and 88 GDPR as well as national Labor provisions and imposed a €50,000 fine.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 88"
"Background

Following a complaint filed by noyb, in January 2019, as well as, complaints from the Netherlands and Denmark against Spotify AB (Spotify) regarding the right of access under Article 15 GDPR, the Swedish DPA initiated an ex officio investigation on whether Spotify’s general practices for handling access requests comply with the GDPR.

After 3 years of inactivity from the DPA, noyb sought remedy under Article 78(2) GDPR from the Stockholm Administrative Court, which eventually sided with noyb. As a result, the DPA has now finally issued a decision on noyb’s complaint, as well as, the other complaints filed against Spotify simultaneously with the DPA’s ex officio investigation. Since Spotify operates in several EU Member States, the DPA applied the cooperation and consistency mechanisms set out in Chapter VII GDPR.

The complaint brought by noyb was identified as ‘complaint 2’, and the complaint from the Netherlands as ‘complaint 1’. The complaint from Denmark was eventually rejected, because the investigation of the case did not show that Spotify has failed in its handling of the complainant's request for access.

Facts on Spotify’s general procedures for handling access requests (ex officio investigation)

With regard to Spotify's general practices on handling access requests, Spotify provides information required by Article 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) GDPR via an online function. When Spotify provides a copy of personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR it includes a file called ""Read me first"" to each copy of data with a link to the information.

Moreover, Spotify provides a copy of personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR by dividing the information to three different layers: “Type 1” that consists profile information, “Type 2” that consists technical log files linked to the data subjects' user IDs and “Type3” that consists information specifically requested by a data subject. Spotify provides the information in JSON format.

Facts on individual complaints that triggered the DPA’s ex officio investigation

Complaint 1

The complainant had made an access request, on 27 May 2018, under Article 15 GDPR to Spotify, and contacted Spotify later again, as the complainant themself noticed that the information provided by Spotify was incomplete. Spotify thereafter provided the remaining data. The data was provided to the complainant in JSON format. Some of the technical log files were provided encrypted which Spotify, during the DPA's investigation, claimed to have been a mistake.

The complainant argued that 1) Spotify did not provide the personal data in due time under Article 12(3) GDPR and 2) that the data was not provided in an intelligible form as required by Article 12(1) GDPR.

Complaint 2

The complainant made an access request, on 10 Oct 2018, under Article 15 GDPR to Spotify by using Spotify's ""Download your data"" feature that provided the ""Type 1"" information. The ""Type 1"" data was provided to the complainant in JSON format. The complainant did not return to Spotify for further information.

It was argued by the complainant that 1) Spotify had not provided all of the personal data that Spotify processes about them, 2) Spotify had not provided any of the information as required by Article 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) GDPR, and that 3) Spotify had not provided the personal data in an intelligible form as required by Article 12(1) GDPR. At the time of the complainant’s request, Spotify had not yet implemented its practice - mentioned above - where Spotify includes the “Read me first” file to its responses to access requests. Such information was available only in Spotify’s privacy policy, at the time.","Holding with regard to the ex officio investigation on Spotify’s general procedures for handling access requests

Spotify’s practices, with regard to providing the information via an online tool, were found to be sufficient in ensuring that information in accordance with Article 15 GDPR was provided to its users. However, the DPa emphasized that such information must be formulated, in a way, that it fulfils the purpose of the right of access. This means that such information must ensure that i. the data subject is aware of the processing and ii. can verify its lawfulness. Furthermore, the DPA noted that such information must also be provided in a way that fulfils the transparency requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR.

Essentially, the DPA found that Spotify should have taken steps to adapt the information to a user’s specific situation in order for the data subject to be able to verify the lawfulness of the processing concerning them. This was not the case with Spotify’s practices, as it provided the same information to users regardless of who requested access. Moreover, the DPA found that the information provided by Spotify was not concise, clear and transparent, nor easily accessible, because the information was of a general nature or too imprecise for a data subject to understand. In this respect, Spotify was found to be in breach of the Articles Articles 15(1)(a)-(d) and (g), and Article 15(2) GDPR as well as Article 12(1) GDPR.

Since a data subject has to take different actions to request the different layers of data, the DPA considered it may cause some inconvenience to the data subject. However, Spotify's practices in this respect did not violate Article 15(1) and (3) GDPR because the DPA considered that the data subject has the possibility to take all these actions at the same, if requested directly through Spotify's customer service. After an overall assessment, DPA concluded that Spotify's general procedures allow data subjects to request access in a sufficiently simple manner.

The DPA found that design and format used by Spotify generally meets the transparency requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR, but noted that Spotify provides by default the detailed description of the data in the technical log files only in English. It follows from Article 12(1) of the GDPR that the information provided under Article 15 GDPR must be given in a concise, clear and plain, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

The DPA held that description of the data in the technical log files provided by Spotify did not fulfill the requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR, as such information was provided by default only in English. In this respect, Spotify was found to be in breach of Article 12(1) GDPR.

As a result of the investigation, Spotify was issued with a fine of approx. 5 000 000 EUR (58 000 000 SEK) as a result of its infringements.

Holdings on the individual complaints (Complaint 1, and Complaint 2)

Complaint 1

As was raised already in the ex officio investigation, the DPA found it possible to split the information into different layers, provided that the data subject has been sufficiently informed (how the copy of personal data is split and how access to the different layers can be requested).

As a result, the DPA found that Spotify, at the time of the complainant's access request, did not provide sufficiently clear information for the complainant to understand that the copy of personal data was disaggregated. Given the lack of information in that regard at the time of the complainant's request, Spotify should have disclosed all the personal data it processed about the complainant after the complainant’s initial access request. Furthermore, Spotify should have provided an explanation for the data provided in encrypted form. The complainant's possibility to contact customer service and request additional information was considered irrelevant by the DPA, as it found such behaviour presupposing that the complainant would understand that there was additional personal data to be disclosed.

Spotify breached Articles 12(1), 15(1), and 15(3) GDPR by failing to provide all of the complainant's personal data in an intelligible form. Furthermore, Spotify breached Article 12(3) GDPR by providing the copy of personal data too late. The DPA issued Spotify a reprimand.

Complaint 2

Likewise in Complaint 1, the DPA noted that it is possible to divide the copy of personal data into different layers, provided that the data subject has been sufficiently informed on how to request all data.

After assessing the information provided by Spotify, at the time of the complainant's access request, the DPA found that it was not sufficiently clear for the complainant to understand that only a subset of the personal data was covered by the request. Furthermore, the DPA considered irrelevant that the complainant could have, as claimed by Spotify, contacted Spotify's customer service requesting additional information.

The DPA highlighted, inter alia, that when it is unclear whether the request relates only to a part of the personal data, the controller should assume that the data subject wishes to have access to all their personal data.

Eventually, the DPA held that Spotify breached Articles 15(1) and 15(3) GDPR by failing to provide access to all personal data processed by Spotify about the complainant. Furthermore,  Spotify was found to breach Articles 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) GDPR by failing to provide any of the information listed in those provisions. It was not sufficient that information was available in Spotify’s privacy policy at the time of the complainant's request.

However, the DPA considered that JSON format is currently an electronic commonly used format referred to in Article 15(3) GDPR. The DPA issued Spotify a reprimand, and ordered Spotify to comply with the complainant's access request and provide the complainant with the remaining information.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 60"

Following such, the Romanian DPA started and investigation.  During such, the Romanian DPA sent a request of information to the data controller. The data controller did not respond to the authority's request.","The Romanian DPA found that the data controller has violated the provisions of Article 83 (5)(e), by not responding to the Romanian DPA's request of information, during such investigation.

"After procedure 7.2020, in which a decision established a deadline for TIM, as the controller, to implement a series of corrective measures, the Italian DPA received several complaints relating to issues already subject to the aforementioned decision. These complaints referred mainly to the following:

1) unsolicited advertising telephone calls, text messages and emails (often repetitive);

2) missed or late response to access requests;

3) publication of personal numbers in telephone directories;

4) unavailability of privacy information during the purchases on the controller's website;

5) a possible data breach.

The Italian DPA grouped together the complaints of a similar and repeated nature and opened a wide investigation against the controller.

1) As for the unsolicited phone calls, the controller denied that data subjects were contacted by its ""commercially active sales force"" and stated that it did not recognize the calling numbers. It also claimed that, before using personal data obtained from external providers, it verifies that data subjects gave their consent by carrying out a test on a random sample of names included in the database. According to the controller, the data from data subjects who appear to have denied their consent  for marketing activities are deleted.

2) With regard to personal data access requests, the controller presented different justifications. In some cases, it claimed to be unaware of the access request or that it was not possible to authenticate the user. In others, it admitted not having answered them or having answered them only partially. About the requests relating to unwanted calls, it claimed that it did not provide more information because it did not recognize the calling numbers as its own numbers.

3) Similarly, the controller presented several arguments in relation to telephone directories. In general, it stated that its customers received a copy of the contractual conditions in which they consented to the publication of their personal data in telephone directories. However, it recognized that there was a misalignment between its systems, which hindered the processing of consent withdrawals. In this regard, the controller informed that the anomaly was resolved and that confidentiality requests are being adequately addressed. In other specific cases, it argued that the the responsability was exclusively on the publisher of the public directories.

4) Concerning the complaints on the unavailability of the privacy information, the controller once again attributed the fact to a temporary anomaly in the system. This anomaly - TIM said - was already resolved and customers could then access the privacy policy before the conclusionof online purchases, expressing their consent for purposes other than the performance of the contract.

5) Finally, with reference to the data breach, the controller alleged that it received no reports or comlplaints on the matter. However, from the checks carried out on its commercial systems, it emerged that some data subjects were associated with the tax code other persons and mistakenly received communications containing their personal data such as name, surname, tax code and telephone number.","1) First, the Italian DPA highlighted the significant overall number of complaints made against TIM and its crucial role as a major operator in the telecommunications market. According to the DPA, the accountability principle provided for by Article 5(2) GDPR implies that the controller must be proactive and constantly monitor its supply chain in order to ensure that the processing of users' personal data is legally compliant. It rejected the argument that the calling numbers could not be recognized as those in use by the controller and its commercial partners since they were made in the controller's name. Therefore, it held that the controller did not make sufficient efforts to monitor the activities carried out on its behalf.

The DPA characterized the practice of using numbers that are not from the company's official sales force, or that cannot be identified, as 'spoofing' or 'undergrowth'. According to the DPA, these camouflage techniques consist of illegal operators who contact people without having obtained their consent, or even people who have expressly opposed this type of calls, in an attempt to reabsorb them as consumers within the official chain of companies. In turn, these companies approve the contracts and recognize the sales activity carried out by these intermediaries, fueling the illicit market. Based on this findings, the DPA considered that TIM violated Article 6 GDPR, for the lack of a legal basis for the processing of personal data.

Furthermore, the DPA reinforced that it is up to the controllers to verify that the contracts proposed by the sales network originate from a regular contact and in line with the specific sector regulations.  In the DPA's view, TIM failed to demonstrate that it had carried out adequate checks on the contracts activated by third parties acting on its behalf, something that would have been possible considering the size and structure of the company. Therefore, it found a violation of Article 24 GDPR.

Moreover, the DPA stressed that controllers must be able to demonstrate that they obtained consent, pursuant to Article 7(1) GDPR. The evidence of the online consent must be provided with technical methods such as to guarantee the unchangeable registration of the authentic will of the user. In this sense, with regard to the legitimacy of the consents allegedly expressed by data subjecthe DPA pointed out that the documentation produced by the list providers is not suitable for demonstrating the real and genuine expression of consent with regard to promotional messages and their transfer to third parties.

Besides, where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide them with the provided for by Article 14 within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, but at the latest within one month, which TIM also failed to do.

2) The DPA recalled that controllers must provide information on action taken on a request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. For the legislator, this is the maximum term, which, only exceptionally, can be extended by two further months, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. In the case at hand, the DPA held that the controller failed to reply to the requests, withou any legitimate justification. Therefore, it found a violation of Article 12 (2) and (3) and 15(1) GDPR. It is also deemed necessary to order Tim to adopt organizational and technical measures aimed at improving the management of such requests.

3) The DPA also considered that the evidence did not reveal the obtention of a specific consent with regard to the publication of numbers in the telephone directories. In fact, although obliged to demonstrate compliance with its obligations, TIM limited itself to show a copy of the screen displaying the 'consent' in its systems, without attaching a copy of the forms signed by the data subjects or other documentation (e.g.: voice recording) showing agreement to publication in the directory. The DPA stressed that the lack of expression of will  should be recorded as a refusal (and not as consent). For these reasons, the DPA held that the controller violated Articles 6 and 7, as well as Article 12(3) GDPR.

4) With regard to the privacy information on the controller's website, the DPA accepted the argument that there was a technical problem of short duration and found no violation.

5) Finally, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 32(1) GDPR by framaining inactive over time, failing to verify and solve the data breach even after it was reported by a data subject.

Considering the seriousness of the violations as well as their recurrence, the DPA issued a fine equal to 1.5% of the statutory maximum (508,745,019 euros), calculated with respect to the Company's turnover (12,718. 625.495), which amounted to €7,631,175.00.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 14, Article 15, Article 24, Article 32"
"The Controller is the operator of a platform for short-term car rental: “CityBee”. It was made aware by another company that provides cyber-security services, that CityBee’s customer data of 110,302 users was published on the website RaidForums.com. The controller notified the DPA, who conducted an investigation.

The DPA found out that the personal data was retrieved from an unprotected database backup BACPAC file (DB file), and contained the following: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, personal identification number, driving license number, type of payment card and the last four digits of the number, the expiration date of the payment card, and the user identifier (token) in Braintree (software for online payments). This DB file was created on 27 February 2018, and access to the file was suspended on 16 February 2021. Hence, the DPA concluded that the personal data breach existed for this entire period.

The DPA found that a number of organisational and technical security measures were missing: there was no competent person responsible for security and risk management, no logs were kept of access and changes to the DB files, the DB file was stored unencrypted, the passwords in the DB file had a weak encryption (SHA-1) and easy to retrieve by persons with technical knowledge, and users could make passwords that did not comply with the requirements as set out in the company’s IT security policy. Lastly, the controller did not assess and manage the risks associated with the loss of the DB file, since it was not even aware of the existence of this DB in the first place (!).","The DPA considered the lack of organizational and technical measures and held that properly using basic security measures, such as authenticated access to the DB file only for staff members, encrypting the DB file and entrusting only authorised staff members with the encryption key, or proper monitoring of information resources, would have ensured confidentiality of the personal data. Hence, it considered Article 32(1)(a), Article 32(1)(b), Article 32(1)(d) GDPR to be breached.

Pursuant to Article 82(2) GDPR, the DPA took several aggravating factors into account to determine the amount of the fine. First, it noted that a large number of data subjects were affected, and that it is unclear how many persons have had access to the DB file, and to which extend the data have, and will still be, exploited (Article 82(2)(a)). Second, the personal data contained personal identification numbers (Article 82(2)(g)), and these unique identifiers were not encrypted. Lastly, the DPA held that the absence of a risk assessment on processing of the DB file, and the controller’s assumption that its process was secure, was negligent Article 82(2)(b).

The DPA also considered several other factors, such as the cooperation of the controller with the DPA, the fact that no sanctions were previously imposed on the controller (Article 82(2)(e)), or the fact that the controller reported the data breach within the time limits set out in Article 34 GDPR (Article 82(2)(h)). However, these factors were not considered to be either aggravating or mitigating.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 83"
"The Lithuanian DPA ('VDAI') received a complaint stating that in order to use the services of a sports club (UAB VS FITNESS), fingerprint scanning is required. It then initiated an own volition investigation of a possible breach of the GDPR.","The VDAI found that the sports club had violated the following GDPR provisions:

* It violated Article 9(1) GDPR by processing the biometric data of customers, which is special category data. The sports club had attempted to rely on the consent exception, outlined at Article 9(2), that special category data may be processed where the data subject provides their consent. However, the VDAI found that consent collected from customers did not satisfy the requirements for valid consent established in the GDPR. In particular, since consent to the biometric system was not voluntary, it was not freely given;
* The processing of employees' fingerprints was also in breach of Article 9(1) GDPR, as the club had again attempted to rely on consent as a basis for processing. The VDAI highlighted that employee consent is generally considered invalid due to the power imbalance with an employer. Moreover, the club did not specify the purpose and legal basis of the processing of employee data, nor had it demonstrated the necessity and proportionality of this processing, in violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR;
* It violated Article 13(1) and (1) GDPR, and Article 5(1) GDPR by failing to adequately inform data subject's about the processing of their data;
* It failed to perform an assessment of the impact of the processing of biometric data, in violation of Article 35(1) GDPR;
* It did not manage a record of its processing activities, in violation of Article 30 GDPR.

It thus issued a fine of €20,000. In determining the fine, the VDAI took into account:

* The processing of special categories of personal data;     
* That Improper exercise of data subject's right to be informed falls into a category of more serious infringements under Article 83(5) GDPR;     
* That the club had previously been instructed on how to lawfully process biometric data at another sports club it owned, for example by making the processing of biometric data voluntary, offering an equivalent, optional alternative to identification without the use of fingerprints, and providing customers the possibility to cancel the use of fingerprints at any time should be regulated. In view of these circumstances, the VDIA considered the illegal processing of customers' personal data to be an intentional violation.

"On 1st October 2020, an article published on a French media website revealed the existence of a personal data breach concerning the data stored on KG COM's (controller) server. The controller operates several websites to offer its customers clairvoyance readings by chat or phone.

According to this article, the controller’s database was not subject to special security measures and it was freely accessible on the internet until 23rd July 2020. The data exposed included the identification data and contact data of prospective and actual customers (data subjects).

Following the publication of the article, the French DPA (CNIL) carried out three investigations into the controller’s practices.","During its investigations, the CNIL noticed several infringements:

1. Failure to comply with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR

The controller systematically recorded all phone calls between telephone operators and prospective customers, as well as between fortune-tellers and customers, with the aim of checking service quality, proving that a contract has been performed and protecting their interests in civil proceedings. The controller did not provide any justification for the practice of systematically recording all calls for these purposes.

For the purposes of quality control, the establishment of a randomised system of recording allows the person in charge of quality control monitoring to have the necessary elements to evaluate the quality of the services offered.

Furthermore, a controller who wishes to record telephone conversations for probatory purposes must demonstrate that they do not have other less intrusive means to prove that the contract concluded over the phone was concluded with the person concerned.

With regard to the complete and systematic recording of telephone calls in the perspective of complying with judicial orders, they do not have to organize, in advance, the collection of personal data with a view to responding to a judicial order which is only potential. Therefore, the recording of all telephone calls, in order to respond to a judicial order, is not justified.

In addition, the controller recorded calls made with prospective customers. During these telephone calls, they collected the bank data of prospects (credit card number, expiry date and cryptogram). The recording of data subjects' bank data in a phone call is intrinsically not useful for the controller in the context of purposes mentioned above.

2. Failure to comply with Article 5(1)(e) GDPR

Through an analysis of the controller’s policies, the CNIL determined that the retention period for personal data was set at three years from the end of the commercial relationship. Nevertheless, the controller retained the data of subjects who did not have ""consultations"" for over five years.

The CNIL held that the data necessary for the execution of contracts should be kept for the duration of the contractual relationship. At the end of the contract, they must be kept in an archive and for a reasonable period of time, if the controller has a legal obligation to do so (for example, to meet accounting or tax obligations) or if he wishes to retain evidence in the event of litigation. For this purpose, it will be necessary to provide for a dedicated archive database or a logical separation in the active database, after sorting the relevant data to be archived.

3. Failure to comply with Article 6 GDPR

In respect of card details, the retention of payment card data beyond the completion of a transaction for the purpose of combating payment card fraud does not fall within the scope of the contract. The same can be said for the retaining of details for the purpose of auto-completing the data when the data subject wants to re-use the services. The retaining of bank details requires that a prior free, specific, informed and unambiguous consent of persons is collected.

4. Failure to comply with Article 9 GDPR

During the ""consultations"", data subjects provide the controller with data concerning their health status and sexual orientation. At the end of the consultations, this information was recorded in the data subjects' files, which were retained by the controller. The simple desire to receive a clairvoyance service and the fact the information is delivered directly from the data subject does not constitute an explicit consent of the data subject for the storing of their sensitive data.

5. Failure to comply with Article 12 GDPR

Information is considered easily accessible, within the meaning of Article 12 GDPR, if it is provided to the data subject, without the need to actively search for it. When data subjects created a user account on the controller's website, they had to leave the registration process in order to return to the home page, scroll to the bottom, click on the controller’s general conditions of sale and actively search this document for information relating to the protection of personal data. Since several actions were necessary for the data subject to obtain information on data processing, this was not considered information that is easily accessible.

Furthermore, the ""general conditions of sale"" were not easily identifiable as a document with information on data processing.

6. Failure to comply with Article 28 GDPR

In two of the controller's contracts with subcontractors (Processors), there was an absence of signatures and mandatory terminology required pursuant to Article 28(3) GDPR. These circumstances did not ensure effective protection of personal data processed through contractual guarantees.

7. Failure to comply with Article 32 GDPR

Data subjects were allowed to implement passwords using only a single character. In addition, the controller’s access to their CRM system was based on a permissive rule: username and password had been created by only two employees, and without any special rule concerning the complexity of passwords. The mechanism used by the controller to encrypt bank data had also vulnerabilities.

Access to the controller’s website was at one point made using http protocols instead of the https protocols, which then exposed the data to the risk of computer attacks or leaks as http allows for the unencrypted reading of flows containing personal data, including bank data, between the data subjects browser and the server hosting the site.

8. Failure to comply with Article 33 GDPR

The controller was aware of the breach since 29th September 2020, when the journalists provided a sample of the impacted data, or no later than 30th September 2020 at the end of its internal investigations. Due to the severity of the breach, it was considered notifiable under Article 33(1) GDPR. However, no notification was made. However, in limiting the controller's responsibility, the CNIL held that the journalist's alert came after the server was closed (as of 10th July 2020) and that the processor did not keep the connection logs to the server concerned. This procedure meant the controller was not able to assess the incident and establish a personal data breach as defined in Article 4(12) GDPR.

9. Failure to comply with Article 7 GDPR

The cookie banner on the controller's website did not contain information on how to refuse trackers, the consequences of a refusal and the existence of the right to withdraw consent.

10. Fine imposed

A fine of €150,000 was imposed on the controller (€120,000 for GDPR violations and €50,000 for France’s Data Protection Act violations).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 28, Article 32, Article 33, Article 82"
"After numerous press reports, the Italian DPA learned that some cemeteries in Rome had a specific area for 'products of conception' and 'fetuses' that were buried in small graves over which the names of women who had had abortions were affixed on a cross. Differently from other areas of the cemeteries, where fetuses were buried after a cerimony, in this specific areas the burials were made at the request of the local health agency and did not receive a funeral. 

The Italian DPA then opened a wide investigation that was divided in 3 procedures: one against the local health agency (ASL), one against the public company that managed the cemeteries (AMA) and one against the City of Rome (owner of the public company). In the course of the investigations, the DPA found that  AMA had signed a service contract with the City of Rome, through which it was identified as the processor, pursuant to Article 28 GDPR.","After the investigations, the Italian DPA concluded that the AMA, originally a processor, acted beyond the instructions of the City of Rome, violating Article 29 GDPR. Therefore, it held that the company determined the purposes and means of that procesing and considered it as the controller.

The DPA then highlighted that information about abortion constitutes health data and that the spontaneous or voluntary interruption of pregnancy for reasons of health risk is considered as a disease, according to Italian law. Moreover, the law establishes a strict regime of confidentiality to protect the woman's right to anonymity, criminalizing the disclosure of the identity of women by health professionals. 

The DPA further emphasized that there is no law requiring the names of women who had an abortion to be placed on the graves of the fetuses. According to the DPA, the controller should have implemented sufficient measures to ensure that only an identification code, associated with the name of the parents in the cemetery register, was placed on the graves. 

Finally, the DPA noted that upstream processing os these sensitive data, transferred from hospitals to the health agency and from the latter to the cemeteries must be adapted to comply with data protection. For instance, by applying the data minimization principle, health agencies should no longer include women's personal details in the transport and burial authorizations that are sent to the cemetery services. Instead, health agencies can  implement technical (e.g. pseudonymisation or data encryption) and/or organizational measures to avoid the direct identification of the women concerned.

For the above reasons, the DPA found violations of Articles 28, 29 and 32 GDPR and issued a fine of €239,000.00",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 29, Article 32"
"A ""ShareArt"" project was implemented in the Municipal Art Collections of Palazzo D'Accursio in Bologna in order to obtain information on the characteristics of the visitors and on the ways in which they interacted with some works of art. The project followed a collaboration agreement between ENEA and the Bologna Museums Institution which is an instrumental body of the Municipality of Bologna (the “Municipality”).

The information was collected with a system using a face detection algorithm (“ShareArt”) developed by the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (“ENEA”). The face detection algorithm was based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect faces in the images. Visitors were informed about the system with a notice at the ticket office that stated, inter alia, that the algorithm ""does not imply face recognition”.

An Italian civil rights organisation (Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights) submitted a report to the Italian DPA in relation to the used ShareArt system. The report stated, inter alia, that ShareArt, using a camera, automatically detected faces looking in the direction of art work, contextually acquiring a series of information relating to behaviour when observing works of art. The report highlighted that only very few signs were in place to indicate to the museum visitors that the system was used: small black cameras attached to the walls and a disclaimer at the ticket office.

Following the report, the DPA launched an investigation and requested for information from the Municipality as well as ENEA. The parties argued, inter alia, that the system does not involve the collection and processing of data relating to identified or identifiable natural persons. Moreover, the Municipality viewed that it did not have any kind of role with regard to the data processing.","Contrary to what was claimed by the controllers, the DPA found that the face detection algorithms process personal data consisting of images of people's faces, albeit for a very short period of time.

Moreover, the Municipality and ENEA were seen as joint controllers, since they jointly determined the purposes and means of the processing. However, the DPA found that the Collaboration Agreement did not satisfy the requirements under Article 26 GDPR. In particularly, it was noted that the agreement did not include the contact details of the joint controllers, or the respective data protection officers, nor did it define the legal basis of the processing, the data retention period, or mention the data subjects' rights.

Having clarified that the use of the ShareArt system involves processing of personal data, it was also found that there was no legal basis under Article 6 GDPR in place for the processing. Furthermore, the DPA concluded that the processing was therefore carried out in a manner that does not comply with the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

Lastly, the notice that informed visitors about the ShareArt system did not contain all the elements required by Article 13 GDPR. Consequently, the DPA found that the processing took place in in violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 12 and 13 GDPR.

After an overall assessment, the DPA deemed it sufficient to reprimand the Municipality as a controller for its multiple GDPR violations.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 26"

"Several Danish citizens had discovered that by logging into their online bank via MitID - a digital identity solution - they gained access to other citizens' accounts. Three different banks that were using the MitID solution within their online banking services each reported a data security breach to the Danish DPA.

Following the reports from the banks, the Danish DPA initiated an investigation on the matter.

The MitID solution is owned in a joint partnership between the financial sector and the public sector, specifically the Digitalisation Agency. The Digitalisation Agency is the data controller for the processing of personal data in MitID.

When the 'MitID' solution is used and it has verified that the user who wants to log in to a service is who they claim to be, an authentication response is generated which is then sent to a broker (the company that conveys the authentication response - in this case the Signaturgruppen, the data controller for the broker solution). The broker forwards the information to the service provider whose service the user wishes to access (which in this case were the banks in question).

According to the Digitalisation Agency, the error was found to be due to the fact that login requests to the same online bank within milliseconds could in special cause MitID to issue a token for another session. This error could have been avoided if the broker (Signaturgruppen) had validated the citizens' login with a technology called ”Broker Security Context”. The Digitalisation Agency had recommended to the brokers implementing the solution to perform the Broker Security Context, but had not made it a requirement.

Signaturgruppen were recommended by the The Digital Agency to perform validation of the tokens that are generated in connection to the log in requests which the brokers receive from MitID. Nevertheless, Signaturgruppen had used the Broker Security Context in a different way than what was described in the recommendation.","It follows from Article 32(1) GDPR that controller must take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks involved in the controller's processing of personal data.

In this particular case the DPA found that there is a significant risk to the rights of the data subjects when the solution is used as a nationwide authentication service. The DPA further emphasised that the primary purpose of which is to validate the identification of individuals with a view to providing access to only information to which the person is entitled to access, including personal data, and which is used as a digital ID for a number of central private and public self-service solutions.

According to the DPA  Article 32 GDPR will normally mean that a provider for a technical log in solution (here MitID) which suppliers of such solution (here brokers) must integrate with, must ensure that the necessary instructions for the implementation of measures for a safe use of the solution, are communicated to the respective suppliers.

Furthermore,  Article 32 GDPR will normally mean that as controller and the broker for a technical log in solution (here MitID) the controller must ensure correct implementation of the recommended security measures in order to avoid accidental access to personal data by unauthorised persons.

Consequently, the DPA held that because The Digital Agency had not made the validation of the tokens a mandatory requirement for the brokers for safe use of the solution, it had not taken appropriate organisational and technical measures pursuant to Article 32(1) GDPR to ensure a level of security suitable for the risks that is for the controller's processing.

Furthermore, regarding Signaturegruppen the DPA found that they violated Article 32 GDPR as Signaturegruppen had not implemented the security measure (Broker Security Context) recommended to it with a sufficiently high entropy.

Against this background, the DPA expressed serious criticism of both the Digitalization Agency and the Signaturgruppen.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"A registered user of an email service (the data subject) requested their data from the email service provider (the controller) in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format pursuant to Article 20 GDPR. The controller denied the request, stating that the data subject could export their emails one by one in an '.eml format'. Furthermore, the controller argued that it is still uncertain whether Article 20 GDPR applies to emails. The controller stated to be in the process of developing an import/export -tool. The tool was not yet available to all users, at the time. The data subject requested the Finnish DPA to investigate whether the controller had fulfilled its obligations under Article 20 GDPR.

The DPA requested an explanation from the controller aiming to understand how the controller facilitated the right to data portability in relation to the email service. Furthermore, the DPA sought to determine whether the controller treated this right differently based on whether the user paid for the service or not.

According to the controller, their intention was to provide data import and export tools for all users. However, due to technical reasons, such as encryption technologies, users had to perform these tasks manually themselves. The controller said to have been working on an automated tool to facilitate mass data export. However, they explained that they were unable to offer it to the entire user base due to technical and development-related challenges. Initially, access to the tool was limited to users with a subscription as a beta version, allowing for testing its stability and functionality on a progressively larger scale.

Following the DPA's request, the tool was made available to free plan customers as well. The version released to them was the same one that had been available to paid customers for over a year.

The data subject argued that the controller intentionally delayed fulfilling its obligations under the GDPR until an investigation by the supervisory authority would be initiated. In the meantime, controller had been generating revenue by charging users for the implementation of rights guaranteed by the GDPR, resulting in financial gain for at least two years.","The DPA held that the controller has violated Articles 20(1) and 12(5) GDPR.

The DPA highlighted that making the automated tool available only for paying customers has practically led to the fact that fully exercising the right to data portability according to Article 20 GDPR has been chargeable. Furtmermore, the DPA considered that the controller had not implemented the data subject's right free of charge as required by Article 12(5) GDPR.

Furthermore, it was noted by the authority that a user of the free plan of the email service can send 150 emails per day. Thus, after just one month of use, the user can have more than 4,000 email messages within the service. Manually exporting messages one by one is slow and transferring all the data would be very time consuming. As a result, the DPA considered that the possibility to export email messages only one by one has practically made it difficult and prevented users from excersising their rights under Article 20 GDPR.

Consequently the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 20"
"Farmacia Ardealul (controller) is a pharmacy that also operates a website for the online sale of its products.

The controller was victim of a malware attack where an unauthorised program was installed on the company's website and thus a fictious form for collecting bank data was displayed to custom-ers when purchasing goods online. This situation led to the breach of confidentiality of personal data (bank data) of a significant number of customers.

The company notified the data breach to the DPA, which then opened an investigation.","The DPA found that the controller had violated Article 32(1)(b), (d) and 32(2) GDPR because they had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a sufficient level of security corresponding to the risk presented by the processing (such as, the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems, and implementing a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing).

Therefore, the DPA sanctioned the controller with a fine in amount of RON 12,424 (approximately €2,500).

"The controller, Dante International SA, owns the biggest online retailer in Romania (eMAG) and has websites available in three different languages: Romanian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian.

The controller received three different data subject requests regarding their Hungarian website:

Firstly, an account deletion: the request was sent to the controller's generic email address. In response, the controller asked the data subject to send their request dated and signed on paper and then scanned or photographed via email.

Secondly, data erasure: the data subject sent their request to 3 different email addresses and via an online contact form. However, all of the requests were automatically rejected as a third party email security provider considered them as coming from an unsafe domain.

Thirdly, data rectification: a data subject requested to have their email address updated. Even if their request was initially confirmed by the controller, the data subject still received communications to its former email address.

The three data subjects filed complaints with the Hungarian Data Protection Authority which referred them to the Romanian Authority in its quality of lead supervisory authority according to Article 60 GDPR.","The Romanian Authority accepted the request, consulted with the Hungarian Authority according to the procedure under Article 60 GDPR, and held the following:

Firstly, for the account deletion request, the controller did not regularly train its employees with regard to data subject right requests. The training in place was deemed insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 24 GDPR.

Secondly, for the erasure request, the lack of a unified channel for receiving data subject requests lead to disproportionate restrictions of data subject rights. The DPA noted that the privacy notice of the controller did not include any information regarding processing performed by third parties and the transfer of the data to third countries, in breach of Articles 13(1) (c), (e), (f), and 14(1) (c), (e),( f) GDPR.

Thirdly, regarding the rectification request, the authority held that the controller did not have an appropriate legal basis (consent) to use the old email address of a data subject for electronic communications.

Considering the above mentioned reasons, the DPA held that the controller:

* did not handle data subject rights requests in accordance with Articles 12(2) and 17(1) GDPR;
* failed to inform data subjects about the third parties processing, and the international data transfers in breach of Articles 13(1) (c), (e), (f), and 14(1) (c), (e),( f) GDPR; and
* did not rely on the appropriate legal basis for processing a data subject's old email address after a rectification request in breach of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.

The complaint was transferred to the Swedish DPA in its quality of lead supervisory authority pursuant to Article 56 GDPR. Following the complaint, the DPA investigated the data transfers from the controller to the US through the use of Google Analytics.

Following the complaint filed by noyb, the Swedish DPA initiated supervision of the controller. The investigation concerned whether the controller transfers personal data to the US through its use of the Google analytics tool, and whether the controller has legal support for this under Chapter V GDPR.","Firstly, the DPA considered whether the data processed through Google analytics tool constitutes personal data and found that the data does constitute personal data as cookies containing unique identifiers were placed on the data subject’s device and subsequently transmitted to Google LLC. It was highlighted by the DPA, that even if such unique identifiers would not in themselves be considered to make individuals identifiable, it must be taken into account that in the present case those unique identifiers can be combined with additional elements.

Secondly, the DPA considered whether CDON AB is the controller, and held that - by deciding to implement the Google Analytics tool on its website for the purpose of enabling the controller to analyse how the website is used – CDON AB determined the purposes and means of the collection and subsequent transfer of those personal data. The DPA confirmed that CDON AB is the controller.

Thirdly, the DPA investigated whether the controller’s transfer of personal data to the US is compatible with Article 44 GDPR and has legal support under Chapter V GDPR. By citing the Schrems II judgment, the DPA noted that the use of the SCCs is not in itself sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of protection for the personal data transferred when transferring personal data to the US when the data importer is to be classified as a provider of electronic communications services within the meaning of 50 US Code § 1881 (b)(4).

Fourhtly, it was assessed whether the controller had implemented sufficient additional safeguards for the data transfers. After the assessment, the DPA found that the additional safeguards adopted by Google were not effective, as they do not prevent the possibility for US intelligence agencies to access the personal data or render such access ineffective. Moreover, neither the SCCs nor the other measures invoked (truncating last octet of IP addresses) by the controller could support the transfer as set out in Chapter V GDPR.

In conclusion, the DPA found that, with the transfers, the controller undermined the level of protection of personal data of data subjects guaranteed by Article 44 GDPR and consequently breached Article 44 GDPR. The DPA issued a fine of 300,000 SEK (approx. €25,000).

The controller was also ordered to ensure that its processing within the framework of the use of the Google Analytics tool complies with Article 44 GDPR and other provisions under Chapter V GDPR. According to the DPA, this shall be done in particular by ceasing to use  of the Google Analytics tool, unless adequate safeguards have been taken.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 44, Article 56, Article 60"
"Starting in May 2023, the ANPC (controller) used body camera devices during on-site investigations performed with businesses. The devices recorded the respective control actions in order to be used as evidences by the ANPC.

Following complaints stating that ANPC breaches data protection legislation by using body camera devices, the DPA opened an investigation. The investigation showed that the recordings captured images of colleagues, employees or representatives of economic operators, as well as other private individuals, including children or adults within shops, swimming pools, restaurants, bars or salons. It also appeared that personal data processed through body camera devices were stored for more than 6 months, without any agreement and without any supervision.","The DPA assessed the legal basis for processing activities and considered that the controller did not prove that there were express legal provisions enabling the use of such devices in the context of its control actions. The processing was also not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

The DPA found that the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a) and 6(a) GDPR and imposed a warning along with an order to cease any personal data processing activities performed through body camera devices and to delete personal data previously recorded as a result of the use of such devices.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"

"On 6 March 2020, a guardian lodged a case regarding the visibility of pupils' personal data in an address book of an e-mail system (edu.kunta.fi) used by the education provider (the controller). The applicant stated that every student in the municipality is affected, as their date is displayed in the e-mail records.

The data made visible consisted of the students´ names, classes, schools and school addresses.

On 18 October 2022, the controller made a statement, explaining how the e-mail system worked. The controller argued, inter alia, that limiting the visibility of student data to school-specific data would at least partly prevent cooperation between schools. The controller noted that the e-mail system used does not support the limitation of the visibility of said data.

The controller also declared that as an immediate measure, it would ensure that the data will no longer be visible in the address book and foresees other changes in the IT system of the municipality.

The legal question posed was whether the controller complied with the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR), the principle of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR) and the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR) when making visible the aforementioned personal data of the pupils.","The Finnish DPA made a reference to the principle of minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR) and Recital 39 of the GDPR, according to which, personal data should be adequate, relevant and necessary for the purposes of data processing.

It was noted by the DPA that it allowed the controller to teach the use of communication tools this way. However, it was also pointed out that it was not necessary that the recipient's address appear in the e-mail address book in order to send a message. Furthermore, it was also mentioned that teachers were allowed to process data about their pupils for the purposes of their work.

Moreover, the DPA considered that pupils also needed to process contact details of other pupils, with whom they were communicating related to school work. However, the DPA found that the data of people outside their own school were not necessary. The DPA also made a remark that even within the same school, the same considerations should be made.

The controller was found to have failed to provide any reasons as to the necessity of the personal data appearing in the address book used by the education provider in all of the municipality's schools. The fact that the system itself does not technically allow limiting the visibility of students' personal data does not constitute justification for the controller.

Thereafter, the DPA held that it was unnecessary that the personal data of every pupil in basic education are visible in every primary and secondary school of the municipality and that it is a breach of Article 5(1)(a) and (c) GDPR. The principle of confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR) also had to be considered. The DPA pointed out that the making available of this data is also against this principle, highlighting that here, the processing of children's data is concerned.

Pursuant to Article 25 GDPR, the controller must take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that only personal data necessary for each specific purpose of processing are processed by default. The DPA required the controller to use IT solutions in the organisation of basic education that are appropriate to the nature of the activity.

It was held that the controller failed to comply with the aforementioned provision of the GDPR. The extensive visibility of the pupils' data lacked appropriateness and necessity. The DPA issued a reprimand to the controller and an order (pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR) to bring the data processing operations in compliance with the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25"
"Bonnier News AB (now Expressen Lifestyle), the controller, is a media company in Sweden. The Bonnier group processed their customers' data for, among other reasons, marketing purposes. They compiled profiles on their users and made these available to affiliated companies who then provided targeted advertisements for their own products and services through direct mail and telemarketing. They relied on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to do so.

At the time of the investigation,which followed a complaint from a data subject, there were 15 such affiliated companies, with the personal data being collected from users and website visitors being stored in two group-wide data bases from which it was then shared with the affiliate companies. One of these databases was a “behavioral data base”.

The personal data recorded in this database, by means of a cookie identifier, included the URL that the user visited, as well as its category and content type, information on the user’s device and their IP address, behavioral data in terms of time spent and the time the page was viewed and also whether the user logged into the website. In some instances, this data could be linked with the user’s data in the customer data base, resulting in a full behavior profile including the user’s age, gender, their car ownership and some variable based on the users’ residential area, such as their life phase, housing type and purchasing power.

During the course of the investigation, the controller argued that they are not joint controllers in respect of the personal data, and that after the affiliated companies access the data provided in the databases, that they alone are responsible for the legality of that processing.

The controller further argued that while the personal data in the customer database was personal data, the data in the behavioral database was comprised of anonymous data and as such was not personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR.

The controller stated that they rely on legitimate interest as a lawful basis for the profiling of their customers and users to provide personalised advertisements. The controller identified the legitimate interest as being the need to ensure relevant content and advertisements for their customers so that they can offer competitive services and have attractive advertising spaces. The controller also submitted that this interest outweighed the interest of their customers in the protection of their personal data. The controller claimed that such was the case as the customers could object to the profiling, that the customers already have a direct relationship with one (or more) of the affiliates, either from having purchased from their websites or having visited their website, that the processing was unlikely to adversely affect the data subject’s interests as their interaction with the affiliates was voluntary and, finally, that the processing is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the data subjects.","The IMY (Swedish DPA), after highlighting the fact that Bonnier set up the framework for the accessing of the personal data by the affiliate countries, held that Bonnier News AB was a joint controller in respect of the processing activities. This included the initial collection of the data, the storage of that data in the databases, the profiling of the data subjects and the use of the data for the purposes of customised advertisements and direct marketing.

The IMY further reasoned that as the behavioral data base distinguished users based on cookie identifiers, and the users can be individually identified from them, the behavioral data base constituted personal data.

The IMY then considered the validity of the controller’s reliance on legitimate interest as a lawful basis for the profiling of user data. It was found that the interest being pursued was legitimate, and the processing in question necessary for the pursuit of the interest.

The IMY then turned to assess the balancing of interests. In respect of the making available of completed behavior profiles, it was noted that the overall benefit of the processing was for the controller to generate revenue from advertisements. The IMY disagreed with the controller’s assertion that the processing would be consistent with the reasonable expectations of the data subject, finding that the profiling was extensive in nature and not something which could be reasonably expected without consenting. The IMY thus found that the privacy interests of the data subjects outweighed the interest being pursued by the controller and as such, the controller infringed Article 6(1) GDPR.

With respect to the processing of simple behavioral profiles, allowing for the mapping of individuals through observation and the use of cookies, the IMY again held that the data subject’s interest in privacy outweighs the interests of the controller. The IMY reasoned that the monitoring of data subject behavior to provide targeted advertisements could give the data subject’s the feeling that they are being monitored.

The IMY thus found that the controller had processed personal data for profiling based on behavioral data for the purposes of enabling targeted advertisements without a lawful basis, infringing Article 6(1) GDPR.

The IMY issued a fine of SEK 13,000,000 (€1,157,483.21).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6"
"A company offering so-called ""small loans"" - eCommerce 2020 ApS (eCommerce) – sent information about non-payments of loans for registration at a credit scoring company - Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

The Icelandic DPA issued a decision (case no. 2020061901 – see summary on GDPRHub) against Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. after the consumers' association of Iceland filed a complaint against it. Following the investigation in that case, it was revealed that the loan terms of eCommerce did not include any provision stating that non-payment (for 40 days) leads to registration of non-payment at Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

However, in this case eCommerce 2020 disputed the fact that such provision was missing and argued that regardless of the wording in the company's loan terms at any given time, borrowers were always informed of the consequences of non-payments on their loans. Furthermore, eCommerce claimed that there was always some kind of provision in the company's loan terms stating that if a loan defaulted, the company has the right to entrust a third party to collect the loan.

It was also revealed that information on non-payments were registered on behalf of eCommerce 2020 ApS despite the fact that the amount of the payment default was below the minimum amount that could be registered according to the terms of the business license of Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

In light of the above, the Icelandic DPA considered that there may be grounds for imposing an administrative fine on eCommerce 2020 ApS, and initiated an investigation.","Firstly, the Icelandic DPA concluded that eCommerce is responsible as the controller for the processing of the personal data in question when eCommerce sends the information on non-payments to Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. for registration. Moreover, the DPA stated that eCommerce is liable for ensuring that the conditions of the loan terms are met for the registration of non-payments.

Secondly, the DPA considered the lawfulness of the processing of perosnal data in question. The fact that eCommerce sent the information on non-payments of loans for registration despite the fact that the necessary term relating thereto was missing in the loan terms was noted by the DPA. Additionally, the DPA took into account that eCommerce sent information on non-payments for registration even when the amounts were below the minimum amount that could be registered according to the business license of Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf.

Following the above considerations, it was found by the DPA that eCommerce violated Article 6(1)(f) GDPR when it sent the information on non-payments for registration on the basis of legitimate interests. The legitimate interests of eCommerce did not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

Furthermore, the DPA found that with regard to its processing of personal data in question eCommerce breached the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as well as the accountability principle pursuant to Article 5(2) GDPR.

Consequently, eCommerce was issued with a fine of ISK 7,500,000 (approx. € 51,000) due to the registration of unpaid claims due to the so-called small loans at Creditinfo Lánstrausti hf. without the registration conditions being met.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"In March 2021, the Irish DPA became aware of allegations made publicly by a staff member of the Department of Health (DOH). According to these allegations, the DOH, as a controller, collected and processed personal data of plaitinffs of health services to children with special education needs (SEN).

The DPA opened and inquiry to investigate 29 litigation files related to the matter.

On the files, the DPA found evidence that the controller collected information about services that were provided to plaintiffs and their families. To do so, the controller submitted broadly worded questions asking the Health Services Executive (HSE) - an agency under it remit - to share “any other issues HSE feels worth mentioning.” This broad question resulted in the provision of private information about the lives of plaintiffs and their families, including details about plaintiff’s jobs and living circumstances, information about their parents’ marital difficulties and in one case, information received directly from a doctor about the services that were being provided to the plaintiff.

In response to the DPA, the controller claimed that personal data were processed only for the purposes of determining whether an approach should be made to the plaintiff to seek to settle the case.","The DPA clarified that, under sections 41 and 47 of the Data Protection Act 2018, controllers can process personal data where it is necessary to provide or obtain legal advice or in the context of legal proceedings. On the other hand, it emphasized that this processing must respect the principles of necessity and proportionality.

In the case at hand, the DPA found that the controller did not infringe data protection law by seeking information about the services that were being provided to plaintiffs in relation to cases where there was open litigation. However, the DPA found that the controller did infringe data protection law by asking broad questions that resulted in the provision of sensitive information about the private lives of plaintiffs and their families.

According to the DPA, the information collected was excessive and disproportionate to the aims pursued by the controller and the processing for this reason was not necessary for the purposes of litigation. Therefore, the DPA found that there was no lawful basis for this processing in the files examined, and that the controller had infringed the principle of data minimisation.

Additionally, the DPA concluded that the controller had violated its transparency obligations under the GDPR. The inquiry found that it did not include details of its practices in its privacy notice. In particular, the privacy notice did not convey the extent of information sharing that took place between the controller and the HSE. The DPA held that the controller could not rely on any exemptions under the Data Protection Act 2018 to avoid providing summary information about those practices in its privacy policy.

Finally, the DPA found that the controller had infringed the requirements to process personal data securely since it ought to have ensured that better internal access restrictions were in place in relation to the files.

For these reasons, the DPA imposed a fine of €22,500 and a ban on the processing.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9"
"The Icelandic DPA received a notification from the Office of the National Medical Examiner (the controller) about a security breach in its website (Heilsuvera – an online healthcare system and a prescription portal). Personal data of individuals were made available to unauthorised parties through the website.

For example, it was possible that after logging in to the Heilsuvera website, to manipulate so-called parameters to see unauthorized messages (i.e. by right-clicking on the computer mouse to access a code on a specific page on the website and then change it to see another page in the area). It was revealed that it was possible to change the URL of a sonogram image that individuals were given access to from the medical records system in order to see other images within the system, i.e. attachments that were saved there.

The controller explained that the data breach followed, among other things, because there was a fault in the connection cable due to communication with a system outside the Heilsuvera website. More specifically, the controls on the API, which are activated when documents are retrieved from outside the Heilsuvera website, did not have sufficient functionality to confirm rights to access the data.","The Icelandic DPA noted that all processing operations must comply with the general principles under Article 5 GDPR. More specifically, the DPA stated that the processing activities must comply with the principle of integrity and confidentiality pursuant to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

Furthermore, the DPA highlighted that the processing activities in question must also comply, inter alia, with the requirements on the security of the processing pursuant to Article 32 GDPR and the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 25 GDPR.

The DPA considered the nature of the personal data processed (the data contained sensitive data pursuant to Article 9 GDPR within the Heilsuvera website and found that it is extremely important that appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to ensure security of the processing according to Article 32(1) GDPR.

It was also highlighted that in light of the sensitive nature of the information in question, special efforts must be carried out to ensure built-in and default data protection in accordance with Article 25 GDPR.

Eventually, the DPA held that the controller did not ensure the security of personal data processed within the Heilsuvera website in the manner required by Article 32(1)(b)(d) GDPR. It was also found by the DPA that built-in and default data protection was not adequately ensured as required by Article 25 GDPR. As a result, the controller was found to be also violate the principle of integrity and confidentiality Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

On 18 January 2023, the DPA adopted a temporary measure against the controller, Citynews S.p.A. (the owner of the newspaper), limiting the further dissemination of the data subject’s health data.

The controller complied with the above measures, modifying the article, deleting the data subject’s health records and requesting Google to deindex the information. It pointed out that the journalistic content had no intention of harming the dignity of the data subject and claimed that the information had been expressly deemed unpublishable, but the Director responsible, in an autonomous decision, considered it was of public interest and decided to publish it.","The DPA considered both Article 137 of the Italian Data Protection Code and Article 9 GDPR and recalled that sensitive data can be processed even without the consent of the data subject, provided that the processing complies with the principle of essentiality of information and the facts are of public interest.

Similarly,  Article 10 of the Code of Journalistic Ethics prescribes that the publication is permitted in the context of pursuing the essentiality of information, provided that journalists respect human dignity and privacy, especially in cases of serious or terminal illness. For this reason, journalists should refrain from publishing analytical data of strictly clinical interest.

The DPA also considered Article 5 GDPR, in particular, the principles of lawfulness and data minimization.

"A Latvian court requested the Latvian National Health Service to share some data concerning a minor. In such an order, the data subject was identified by name and surname and a numerical code, which turned out to be wrong.

The National Health Service, the controller, identified a wrong data subject by means of the personal numerical code and disclosed their health data to the court.

The Latvian DPA started an investigation against the controller.","The DPA pointed out that Latvian law imposes the use of a unique identifier as the safest way to store and process personal data of citizens. This system is the safest and minimises mistakes such as the unlawful disclosure of health data of people other than the one whose data are requested by a public institution – in this case the court.

However, the DPA also held that this system, taken alone, was not sufficient to avoid unlawful disclosures. In particular, the National Health Service should have relied on additional criteria, such as name and surname of the data subject - which was already known to them. The need of a double check became apparent in the case at issue, where matching the code with these additional pieces of information would have easily prevented the controller from disclosing sensitive data of another data subject.

Therefore, the controller did not put in place technical and organisational measures to minimise risks of unauthorised disclosure and violated Articles 24(1) and 32(1)(b) GDPR. Processing was thus unlawful and infringed Articles 6(1)(a) and (f) and 9(2) GDPR.

"In 2019,  the Special Privacy Unit of the Guardia di Finanza opened a preliminary investigation on the Benetton Group, the controller, regarding the processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes.

In this preliminary procedure, the following issues were identified: a) the cookie banner used on the familycard.benetton.com website did not allow users to deselect some types of cookies and did not mention profiling cookies although they were used; b) the cookie banner on the blackcard.sisley.com site presented a ""click here"" hypertext link leading to a blank page that did not provide the relevant information; c) contrary to what was informed during the registration procedure, personal data collected for the loyalty programs were being stored since 2015, even for customers who did not give their consent to profiling; d) promotional e-mails were sent to customers even after they had opted out of the loyalty program or  withdrawn their consent for marketing communications.

In its defense, the controller stated that the information on the familycard.benetton.com site mentioned cookies for direct marketing, marketing and retargeting cookies of third parties, which, in its view, fell under the definition of profiling cookies. It also claimed that the retention period was in line with the loyalty program, which provided for up to 10 years of retention in order to assess the scores and prizes awarded to members. Moreover, it alleged that its management systems were differentiated between those dedicated to loyalty cards, to digital customers, and its newsletters. According to the controller, each system was managed separately and based on different documentation, so that the customer can decide what type of communication they want to receive. Finally, it claimed to have implemented organizational and technical measures to overcome possible critical profiles identified during the investigations.

The procedure was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic and resumed only in 2021, when the Italian DPA carried out an on-site inspection to verify the measures that the controller claimed to have implemented. In this inspection, the DPA found that: a) the personal data of customers were being stored for indefinite time without a justification; b) personal data of customers were being transferred to third parties for marketing and profiling purposes without consent; c) vulnerabilities regarding the stores' platform such access to the loyalty program system without the need for a login.

With regard to these findings, the controller stated that the data collected through the website was retained for the purpose of allowing customers to use their services uninterruptedly over time. However, it informed that a retention period of was 10 years would be set, without prejudice to an automatic deactivation system in case of inactivity for 24 months. The controller also admitted that the stores' management platform had some technical limitations, but informed that it was already being replaced by a new one.

Finally, the controller argued that Tik Tok and Facebook are commercial partners with whom it signed a contract for the publication of advertising banners. However, it denied transferring data to them and that they processed data on its behalf. According to the controller, Benetton limited itself to preparing advertising content and purchasing the advertising ""spaces"" or areas managed exclusively by the partner companies, without providing them with any personal data.","With regard to the issues identified during the preliminary investigations, the DPA found that the controller significantly improved the management of cookies as well as the the customer database which currently allows the manifestation of specific consent for each purpose. Therefore, the DPA archived the first dispute.

Similarly, the DPA considered as sufficient the explanations provided by the controller regarding the roles played by its commercial partners, Facebook and Tik Tok, and archived the dispute in this regard.

On the other hand, the DPA confirmed that the controller was storing personal data of 249.859 consumers who had already unsubscribed its newsletter as well as information about customers' tastes and preferences for a period of 10 years, although the privacy policy indicated a period of 12 months/24 months for the loyalty card service.

The DPA also confirmed the vulnerabilities of the stores' platform, especially with regard to: a) the lack of particular operational limitations for the stores' computers (screenshots or similar operations could be performed); b) the employee's ability to access the loyalty program without logging-in; c) the absence of a request to change  the password when creating the user account for a new store; d) a password that was shared among all the employees, granting access to the store account; e) the consequent impossibility of identifying the person actually responsible for data breach.

The controller argued that it had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for carrying out the camera surveillance on the premises in order to, inter alia, protect the property. However, despite the DPA’s multiple requests, the controller did not provide any balancing of interests test, nor did it make any statement to the authority of having such document.

Furthermore, in light of Article 13(1)(2) GDPR, the controller claimed that there were printed privacy notices available at the front desk of studio. With regard to its employees, the controller claimed that it had provided information on the processing operations orally and within the job descriptions. However, the controller did not provide evidence to support its statements.","The DPA emphasised that a controller is required to make a prior balancing test under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. However, the controller did not provide such assessment and the DPA concluded that the controller could not rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis required under Article 6(1) GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA noted that even if a balancing of interests had been carried out, the processing at stake could have not have been justified by legitimate interests.

In particular, the controller did not demonstrate the suitability of the cameras in question to the announced processing purpose (presumably, the protection of property), nor their proportionality. The DPA viewed that, in order to protect the property, other available solutions (e.g. lock, padlock, window bars, safe, alarm, motion detector, security guard, etc.) may in some cases provide more security than a camera-based data processing.

Since, according to the controller, the information on processing operations were only made available to the data subjects using the service on paper, on the spot, upon explicit request, the DPA found that no adequate information on the processing was available to the data subjects. Furthermore, the DPA noted that the controller had not demonstrated that the same information was provided to its employees.

Also, the DPA stressed that ANPC had already other available channels for lodging petitions and complaints, such as a registered email account or a form on the institutional website.

Thus, the DPA found that the ANPC violated Article 32(2) GDPR and imposed a warning, as well as corrective measures to process personal data only by using means under ANPC control.

However, the controller did not comply with the request and she filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA, claiming that she never gave her consent for the publication of her child's image.","The DPA stressed that the physical image of a person must be considered as personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR, and thus, it requires a legal ground to be processed.

For instance, when it is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party.

In the present case, the DPA noted that the controller did not inform data subjects about the processing of personal data that it carried out, neither before nor after it took place. In other words, there was no information about the recording of images in parties organized at the controller's venur and their publication on its social media profile. The controller also did not inform if it relied on consent of the parents, in the case of minors under 14 years of age, or the consent of minors, over 14 years of age, differentiating this circumstance.

The Latvian DPA started an ex officio investigation.

The controller claimed that the GDPR was not applicable to them, as the controller had no establishment within the EU. Moreover, the controller argued that data were collected prior to the the GDPR and by public available sources, where data were originally uploaded with the consent of the data subjects.","The Latvian DPA disregarded the argument that the GDPR did not apply to the controller. As a matter of fact, the GDPR applies also to controllers that do not have an establishment within the EU, when their processing activities relate to the offering of goods and services to data subjects within the Union, regardless of whether the latter are asked to pay a fee, according to Article 3(2)(a) GDPR. The DPA also noticed then that the controller did not appoint any representative within the Union, as prescribed by Article 27(1) GDPR.

The argument that data were collected before the GDPR were also discarded, as no provision in the text of the Regulation exempts such a category of data from the scope of the law.

Finally, the DPA assessed whether the controller had a valid legal basis for the processing. The DPA found that consent was not valid, as it was originally given in the context of purposes other than the one at issue. Article 6(1)(a) GDPR also specifies that consent must be given for “one or more specific purposes” to be valid. The processing by the controller thus constituted a violation of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR, to the extent that it infringed the principle of purpose limitation. The fact that the information was publicly available did not authorise the controller to use it for its own processing activities.

In light of the above, the DPA ordered the controller to erase personal data of the people residing in Latvia pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The controller – a company – kept a database with special categories of personal data of its employees. The database was kept for the purpose of choosing the employees to fire at the end of a probationary period. Such database included information about the psychological status of some employees, requests for psychotherapy, and their likeliness to join a workers’ union. A data subject lodged a complaint and a German DPA (Berlin) started an investigation against the controller.","The DPA found that the controller unlawfully processed special categories of data in violation of Article 9(2) GDPR, including health data.

The DPA also ruled out that the contract between the employer and employees could be a valid legal basis for the processing at issue. It is true that under specific circumstances an employer can request its employees to provide certain data, including sensitive ones. Nevertheless, the processing activities at issue in the present case, even when based on data provided directly by workers, were not necessary in the context of the contract and violated the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR.

In light of the above, the DPA fined the controller €215,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9"
"QUALITY-PROVIDER S.A, the controller, provides data services and processes personal data as part of its core activities. The Spanish DPA, prompted by a data subject's complaint, initiated proceedings to investigate alleged violations of the GDPR in relation to activities carried out through the controller's website. During the investigations, the DPA requested the controller to provide some information and documents relating to the investigated facts.

However, the controller refused to provide the information, claiming that the request did not include a copy of the data subject's national identity card, which prevented it from reliably identifying the person and the data concerned.

Then, the DPA decided to carry out an on-site inspection and informed the controller that its representatives should cooperate with the inspectors, facilitating access to the files.

Again, the controller refused to comply with the request, arguing that: a) the Spanish DPA was not competent for the inspection and was not a public body like the other European supervisory authorities; b) the Director of the Spanish DPA could not initiate the proceedings as the position had been extinguished by a decree; c) that Spain had not transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law and that this directive should have been applied directly. Moreover, the controller stated that it would record the inspection and expose the recording in court.","The DPA recalled that Article 51(1) GDPR stipulates that each Member State must establish one or more independent public authorities responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR and that, in Spain, one of these authorities is the AEPD. Also, according to Article 58(2) GDPR and the provisions of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish DPA is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

As for the decree that extinguished the position of Director of the AEPD, the DPA clarified that the General Sub-Directorate for Data Inspection is the equivalent body in its organic structure and maintains its powers.

Finally, the DPA pointed out that the main objective of the Directive (EU) 2019/1937 was to guarantee that employees could denounce infringements in the context of work, which was not the case.

After rejecting all the aforementioned arguments, the DPA held that the controller ilegally prevented it staff from having access to the personal data, information, premises, equipment and means of processing, which was necessary for the exercise of its investigative powers.

Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 58(1) GDPR and issued a fine of €20,000 on the controller. When determining the ammount of the fine, the DPA took into account the degree of intentionality of the offence, as provided for by Article 83(2)(b) GDPR, and also the link between the company's activity and the processing of personal data, as provided for by Article 76(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 58

The DPA held that the controller did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to provide a level of security that is adequate and proportionate to the risks inherent to the processing of such data. In particular, the DPA held that the controller did not prevent the accidental or illegal destruction, loss , modification, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to personal data under its control.

"The Latvian DPA, in cooperation with the Estonian and the Lithuanian one, started a joint investigation about the processing of personal data in the context of car rental services. In particular, there were doubts about the lawfulness of processing activities undertaken by a company – the controller – in the context of a mobile app necessary to use the car rental services. Therefore, the DPA carried out data protection audits and requested access to personal data and other information necessary to the fulfilment of its tasks pursuant to Article 58(1)(b) and (e) GDPR. The controller was “unreachable” and did not comply with the DPA’s instructions. The DPA formally opened a sanctioning procedure against the controller.","The DPA noted that, as all the notification formalities were respected, the fact that the controller was “unreachable” did not exclude its liability pursuant to Article 83(5)(e) GDPR and Latvian administrative law. Also, the controller did not provide any explanation why it failed to comply with the DPA’s order.

The DPA held that the adoption of a fine was the only way to force the controller to comply with the GDPR. In the quantification of such a fine pursuant to Article 83(2) GDPR, the DPA particularly stressed as an aggravating factor the complete lack of cooperation on the side of the controller. Moreover, the DPA referred to its own guidelines on fine determination under the GDPR to qualify the infringement as ‘moderately serious’.

In principle, the DPA held that a €15,000 fine was appropriate. However, in light of the economic difficulties affecting the controller and considering the risk of insolvency high, the DPA decided that a €1,000 was more proportionate in the case at issue.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 58, Article 83"
"Independent of any instructions from the XVIII District Office of the Government of Budapest, the municipality of Pestszentlőrinc‑Pestszentimre carried out a survey on the COVID-19 vaccination status of its local citizens. The controller aimed to produce anonymised statistics on the basis of which municipal decisions in relation to the pandemic could be made.

To send the questionnaire, the controller lawfully obtained the names and addresses of all adult residents in the area. The questionnaire, on the other hand, was deemed non-compliant. It did not make clear that data subjects’ name, telephone number and email address were optional. It did not specify that the name, telephone number and email address, when provided, would be processed alongisde the health data. Lastly, consent to processing was only available upon completion of the questionnaire, when the data had already been submitted.

After a public interest notification, the case was referred to the Hungarian DPA under Hungarian national law.","The controller carried out the processing based on its own decision making it an independent controller under Article 4(7) GDPR.

The controller failed to provide adequate information on the data processing to the data subjects in the questionnaire under Articles 12(1) and 14 GDPR.

Processing the personal data that was optionally added to the questionnaire resulted in excessive processing under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR and 5(1)(c) GDPR. It also breached Article 12(1) GDPR and 13 GDPR as the data subject was not informed of this additional processing. The COVID-19 status of the residents was considered health data under Article 9(1) GDPR. Mixing the processing of the optionally provided data with the health data muddied consent breaching Article 7(2) GDPR. This meant that the controller no longer had a legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR.

"In 2020, the Italian DPA issued Provision n. 10 authorizing the processing of personal data necessary for the creation of a permanent census as part of the national statistical program carried out by the Italian National Institute of Statistics, the controller. While authorizing the creation of the permanent census, the DPA ordered the controller to implement the following security and data protection measures:

a) adopt a pseudonymisation technique [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR]; b) apply the principles of data minimization [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR], purpose limitation [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR] and storage limitation [Article 5(1)(e) GDPR]; c) and to implement privacy by design and by default [Article 25 GDPR].

The provision also addressed specific critical issues in relation to the attribution of a unique code that identifies the individual in the various databases, requiring the controller to implement a rotating decoupling mechanism of pseudonymised codes.

Considering the complexity of these measures, the DPA found that it was necessary to follow their implementation so that compliance with data protection principles was ensured. Therefore, it opened an investigation on the controller based on Article 58(1) (a), (e) and (f) GDPR.","While recognizing the difficulties in implementing the measures and the efforts undertaken by the controller, the DPA found some violations of the GDPR.

First, the DPA noted that the controller was classifying the collected data in three categories: ""identifying data"" (residence, contact information, etc.), ""thematic data"" (income, education, work, etc.) and ""sensitive thematic data"" (sexual orientation, health, etc.). However, it found that the controller was not implementing specific security measures according to this classification. In the DPA's view, it was necessary to consider the nature of the data in the risk analysis to implement safeguards that are adequate to the identified risks. By failing to do so, the controller violated the principle of accountability and the obligations of privacy by design and by default provided for by Articles 5(2) and 25 GDPR.

Second, the DPA noted that the controller uses a ""specific integration domain"" (SID), from where the data necessary for the pursuit of a specific statistical purpose are retrieved. In essence, a subset of information can be extracted from a master table based on specific selection criteria. To make the integration domains independent from each other, the controller uses hierarchical pseudonymisation. When the data is collected, it is assigned a universal pseudonym. This pseudonym is then translated through a cryptographic function into different pseudonyms for the different integration domains. A specific unique encryption key is assigned to each specific integration domain and each domain has a different encryption key.

In the current testing phase, the requests formulated by individual statisticians (analysts) are sent to the competent central directors, who are responsible for assessing and aproving the requests when they are pertinent. According to the DPA, this system leaves the application of the minimization principle to the evaluation of the directors and, therefore, to mere organizational measures. Moreover, the DPA found critical issues regarding the impossibility of automatically detecting anomalies in the SIDs such as the singularity issue, which refers to the possibility of combining unique attributes of a single subject. The DPA deemed necessary to implement automatic detection measures, so that the controller can be immediately aware of the risks to which data subjects are exposed. Therefore, it found a violation of Articles 5(2), 24 and 25 GDPR.

Third, the DPA found that the pseudonymisation system implemented by the controller calculates a hash code for each statistical unit that flows into the integrated microdata system, which is a suitable technique to ensure the uniqueness of pseudonyms on a formal level. However, considering that the creation of the secret key used for the generation of pseudonyms is linked to an extremely volatile parameter (the exact time with milliseconds), the ""controlled reversibility"" of the pseudonymisation technique is inapplicable on a concrete level. According to the DPA, the technique would only be applicable if the controller kept track of the exact time at which each transformation took place. The DPA also stresses that the pseudonymisation carried out by the controller does not yet imply the use of random secret keys diversified by statistical unit. Consequently, in the event of a security incident, even on a single statistical unit, the integration domain would be completely compromised once the syntax of the data is known.

Finally, the DPA also found that the prescribed hierarchical decoupling mechanism of the codes in the various databases and its rotation over time had not yet been implemented. Therefore, the DPA considered that it was not possible to verify that two different pseudonyms deriving from the same master pseudonym code possibly contained in two different integration domains  may refer to the same statistical unit. The DPA concluded that this violated Articles 25 and 32 GDPR.

For the above reasons, the DPA held that the processing of personal data by the controller infringed Articles 5(2), 24, 25 and 32 GDPR and ordered the following corrective measures to bring the activities into compliance:

a) comprehensively complete the source classification process, associating each class with the corresponding level of measurable risk of re-identification of the interested parties whose data are processed in each survey and the technical-organisational privacy by design and security measures capable to mitigate this risk;

b) implement technical measures which, within each integration domain, and before proceeding with the survey, identify the possible presence of singularities on specific combinations of attributes configurable ex-ante and their percentage incidence in the sample, and which signal these with an alert occurrences to the analyst;

c) develop an internal policy for the management of these singularities by the analysts responsible for carrying out the statistical survey, which possibly includes the possibility of reconfiguring the sample through the use of generalization techniques in order to eliminate, or in any case reduce, the incidence of these singularities;

d) refine the process of ""controlled reversibility"" of derived pseudonyms, using a secret key that is more controllable than the millisecond time (e.g. a cryptographic salt) and storing these keys separately, as required by the definition of pseudonymization referred to in the Article 4(5) GDPR;

e) use the master SIM pseudonym also for automated consistency checks on newly created statistical units (for example, uniqueness and accuracy checks) in place of the traditional ""ictu oculi"" checks on direct identifying attributes (such as name, surname, tax code), still widely used and a likely source of errors in the data entry process.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 32"
"The controller allegedly processed personal data - and specifically audio recordings containing the voice of their customers – in an unlawful way.

The Latvian DPA asked the controller to provide information concerning the processing in the context of an ex officio investigation. The controller first asked for the deadline to be extended and then stopped replying to the DPA.

Thus, the Latvian DPA opened a sanctioning procedure against the controller.

After that, the controller replied to the DPA’s request and provided the information.","The DPA noted how Article 58(1)(e) GDPR provides supervisory authorities with the power to obtain from controllers and processors access to all personal data and information necessary for the performance of its tasks.

The notification procedure followed by the DPA to request access to such information respected all the formal requirements under Latvian law.

In light of the above, the DPA decided to issue a €800 fine against the controller. In the determination of the amount of the sanction, the fact that the controller had been already reprimanded for similar circumstances was considered an aggravating factor. On the other hand, the fact that the controller eventually complied with the DPA’s request played a role as a mitigating factor.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 58
"A complaint was initially submitted against Airbnb to a German DPA on 6 July 2018. In the complaint the data subject claimed that Airbnb had failed to comply with two erasure requests he had made on 18 September 2015 and 12 October 2015. The Complainant discovered that his erasure requests had not been complied with when, on 9 June 2018, he found that his account was still active. The complainant submitted an access request to Airbnb (the controller) on 6 July 2018, asking Airbnb to provide information regarding: a) What data they had stored about him, b) Where they obtained the data from, c) What legal basis was used for processing the data, d) To which other parties the data has been transferred to.

In this access request, the data subject expressly objected to a transfer to third parties and asked why his previous erasure requests from 2015 had not been carried out. In this email, he also resubmitted an access request.

On 6 July 2018, Airbnb acknowledged receipt of his email and responded on 17 July 2018 via email, requesting further information from the data subject in order to verify his identity to facilitate the access and erasure requests. In this email, Airbnb asked for a copy of the data subjects’ identification documents.

On 18 July 2018, the data subject responded, refusing to provide a copy of his ID. Airbnb responded to this email on 19 July 2018, asking to verify the data subject’s identity via telephone call instead, the data subject agreed. On 31 July 2018, Airbnb conducted a telephone call with the data subject to authenticate his requests.

On 30 August 2018, Airbnb responded to the data subject’s access request by email and provided a copy of the data but did not acknowledge the erasure request. The data subject’s access request was made in German, and all other communications with Airbnb were also made in German. However, the email attaching his personal data was in English and contained unsorted table columns with incomprehensible column headings.

On 11 September 2018, the data subject responded to Airbnb’s previous communication, claiming that their response to his access request was incomplete. On 13 September 2018, Airbnb acknowledged receipt of the data subject’s email but made no further communications with the data subject.

The original complaint which was submitted on 6 July 2018 was then transferred to the Berlin DPA on 1 January 2019, as Airbnb’s German offices were based in Berlin. On 7 February 2020, the Berlin DPA transferred the complaint to the Irish DPA (DPC) in its capacity as the lead supervisory authority, as Airbnb’s main establishment is in Ireland (Articles 56 and 60 GDPR). However, all communications between the DPC and the data subject were still made through the Berlin DPA. On 13 May 2020, the DPC notified Airbnb of the complaint.

On 27 May Airbnb responded to the DPC, noting that the 2015-pre GDPR erasure requests had not been upheld because their systems registered them as spam-mail. Moreover, in relation to the access and erasure requests made by the data subject on 6 July 2018, Airbnb stated that the file was provided on 28 August following the confirmation of the data subject’s identity and that the data subject’s erasure request was “commenced on 29 August 2018.” In addition, as to Airbnb’s incomplete access request response, Airbnb noted that it had referred the data subject to sections 2,3,4 and 7 of its Privacy Policy, which Airbnb argued addressed the questions on “which data? From where? On what legal basis? Transferred to whom?”

The data subject was dissatisfied by Airbnb’s response of 27 May 2020 and communicated this to the Berlin DPA on 3 August 2020, which was then passed on to the DPC on 14 October 2020. In this, the data subject did not accept that Airbnb had erased his data and questioned why Airbnb erased his data immediately after his access request before he could review their response to it.

The DPC notified Airbnb of the data subject’s complaint from 3 August 2020 and requested a further response from Airbnb. On 9 December 2020, Airbnb responded mainly reiterating its submissions made on 27 May 2020. The DPC communicated this response from Airbnb to the data subject via the Berlin DPA on 24 March 2021. On 13 July 2021, the data subject reiterated his dissatisfaction with Airbnb’s response of 9 December 2020.

On 22 December 2022, acting in its capacity as the lead supervisory authority the DPC commenced an inquiry into the matter on the following issues:

* Issue 1: Whether Airbnb’s provision of the personal data and information concerning the processing of that personal data in response to the Complainant’s [data subject’s] access request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act [the Data Protection Act 2018]. 
* Issue 2: Whether Airbnb’s handling of the Complainant’s access request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act insofar as the information provided to the Complainant was in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. 
* Issue 3: Whether Airbnb’s handling of the Complainant’s erasure request was compliant with the GDPR and the Act.
* Issue 4(a): Whether Airbnb’s obligation to provide information on action taken in response to the access and erasure requests without undue delay pursuant to Article 12(3) GDPR was suspended until after the verification of the Complainant’s identity by phone call on 31 July 2018. 
* Issue 4(b): Whether Airbnb had a lawful basis for requesting a copy of the Complainant’s ID, and upon the Complainant’s refusal to provide same, whether Airbnb had a lawful basis to thereafter request a telephone call in order to verify the Complainant’s identity in circumstances where he had submitted a request for access and erasure pursuant to Articles 15 and 17 GDPR.

The DPC did not consider the two erasure requests made in 2015 as they were made prior to the application of the GDPR. The DPC came to a decision on the above issues on 20 July 2023.","Issue 1: Whether Airbnb’s provision of the personal data and information concerning the processing of that personal data in response to the Complainant’s access request was compliant with the GDPR.

Article 15 GDPR confers a right of access upon the data subject. This right provides that a data subject has the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing from the controller. The DPC noted that certain information was withheld form the data subject, such as the sources form where his data had been obtained and the legal bases to processing. Only following the DPC’s intervention did Airbnb provide the Complainant with the additional information. The DPC found that Airbnb’s incomplete response to the data subject’s access request constituted a violation of Article 15(1) GDPR.

Issue 2: Whether Airbnb’s handling of the Complainant’s access request was compliant with the GDPR insofar as the information provided to the Complainant was in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

Article 12(1) GDPR obliges controllers communicating information to data subjects under Articles 13 – 22 GDPR to convey it in a “concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language.”

Some of the information provided to the data subject by Airbnb, in response to his access request, was in English even though the original request was made in German. Moreover, the email responding to the access request contained unsorted table columns with incomprehensible column headings. The DPC held that this response was an infringement of Article 12(1) GDPR, as the data provided was not conveyed in a transparent manner. The presentation of the data was difficult to understand and provided in a different language to that of the original request.

Issue 3: Whether Airbnb’s handling of the Complainant’s erasure request was compliant with the GDPR.

Article 17 GDPR establishes the right to the erasure of a data subject’s personal data. The DPC found that the data subject submitted a valid request for erasure on 6 July 2018, but that only 22 months later did Airbnb address the erasure requests (email of 27 May 2020). The DPC reaches no conclusion as to Article 17 GDPR, but considers the delay to the response in issue 4(a) below.

Issue 4(a): Whether Airbnb’s obligation to provide information on action taken in response to the access and erasure requests without undue delay pursuant to Article 12(3) GDPR was suspended until after the verification of the Complainant’s identity by phone call on 31 July 2018.

Article12(3) GDPR provides that requests made to controllers under Articles 15-22 GDPR must be responded to within a month. The data subject submitted both his access and erasure requests on 6 July 2018, the erasure request was undertaken by Airbnb on 29 August 2018, but it was only communicated to the data subject on 27 May 2020. A period of over 22 months had elapsed between the lodging of the erasure request and the date on which Airbnb communicated information to the data subject on the action it had taken in relation to it.

In relation to this, the DPC asked whether Airbnb’s obligation to provide information without undue delay pursuant to Article 12(3) GDPR was suspended for the purposes of Article 12(3) GDPR until after the verification of the Complainant’s identity by phone call on 31 July 2018. The DPC in response to the above question, adopted the EDPB’s position on the matter (EDPB Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access). These guidelines state that the time limit under Article 12(3) starts once the controller has received a request under Article 15 GDPR, but if the controller is uncertain whether the person making the request is the data subject, there is a suspension in the Article 12(3) GDPR time limit until the controller has verified the identity of the person making the request, “provided the controller has asked for additional information without undue delay…” Consequently, the request for further information is subject to the Article 12(3) GDPR time limitations.

The DPC found that the suspension of the Article 12(3) GDPR was applicable in this instance. Nonetheless, Airbnb was in breach of Article 12(3) GDPR regardless, because even after having verified the identity of the data subject, it still surpassed the time limit in communicating the outcome of the data subject’s erasure request.

Issue 4(b): Whether Airbnb had a lawful basis for requesting a copy of the Complainant’s ID, and upon the Complainant’s refusal to provide same, whether Airbnb had a lawful basis to thereafter request a telephone call in order to verify the Complainant’s identity in circumstances where he had submitted a request for access and erasure pursuant to Articles 15 and 17 GDPR.

Article 5(1)(c) GDPR establishes the principle of data minimisation, meaning that data processing must be limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of processing. The DPC found that the initial request to verify the data subject’s identity with a copy of his ID was an infringement of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, as less invasive means of identity verification (ie., telephone call) were available to Airbnb.

The DPC found therefore, that there was no lawful basis for requesting a copy of the data subject’s ID, but found that the telephone call “was a proportionate and appropriate form of contact … to verify the authenticity of the access and erasure requests.”

Remedial Actions Taken

Despite the numerous GDPR infringements, the DPC found that issuing an administrative fine “would not be necessary, proportionate or dissuasive,” and instead issued a reprimand to Airbnb pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17"
"A physician recorded a patient from the hospital he worked at, on his personal telephone, and subsequently posted the video on his Facebook page. The recording took place without the patient’s consent. The physician deleted the video from his Facebook page on the same day as the one he uploaded it.

Following the submission of a complaint to the DPA, an investigation was initiated.

During its investigation, the DPA found that the physician’s recording and subsequent post on his Facebook account revealed the patient’s personal data, including their physical image, voice, name, surname and health status. The post and this information was seen by a large number of people and was also further disclosed on various websites and media channels.","The DPA assessed the GDPR infringements alongside domestic legislation on patient rights. Specifically, it took into consideration Article 20 of Law 46/2023, which establishes that a patient may not be photographed or filmed in a medical unit without his or her consent, except in cases where the images are necessary for the diagnosis of treatment and to avoid suspicion of medical fault.

The DPA found a violation of Article 5 GDPR, Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 9 GDPR. Article 5 GDPR establishes the principles of data processing.

Firstly, Article 5(1)(a) GDPR notes that personal data must be processed ""lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner."" Article 5 GDPR read in line with Article 6 GDPR, establishes that processing may only be lawful if it is conducted on one of the legal bases outlined in Article 6(1) GDPR. Given that the data processing (the filming and posting) had no legal basis under Article 6 GDPR and was also illegal under domestic law, the Romanian DPA found a violation of  Article 5 GDPR and Article 6(1) GDPR.

Secondly, Article 9(2)(a) GDPR establishes that the prohibition against processing sensitive data as outlined in Article 9(1) GDPR is lifted, if the data subject explicitly consents to the processing. Health data is sensitive data under Article 9 GDPR. The physician’s recording revealed the patient’s health status and was filmed without their explicit consent. This amounted to violation of Article 9 GDPR.

As a result of the violations, the physician was fined 9919.2 RON (equivalent to €2000).

The DPA also imposed corrective measures by ordering the physician to ensure compliance with GDPR of his processing operations to ensure that the patients’ personal data was processed with the observance of the GDPR and domestic law governing the processing of patient data in a medical context.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9"
"On the 30th of November 2020, an external phone call notified the controller about a data breach. This was initially not recognised as a security flaw, and therefore was not immediately reported further within the controller organisation.

The controller,the insurance company Moderna Försäkringar (since April 2022 Trygg-Hansa A/S), notified Swedish DPA in December 2020, that a data breach had occurred. As a result, unauthorised access to the personal data of 650,000 customers, including special categories listed in Article 9(1) GDPR, was made possible.

In March 2021, the Swedish DPA initiated an investigation to uncover whether the controller had implemented appropriate safeguards and mitigated risks to the data subject resulting from the data processing, in line with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR.

The data breach notification pertained to16 different document types, that the Swedish DPA subsequently reviewed. The documents contained multiple categories of personal data: names, contact information, health accounts, ID numbers, economic data, etc. The controller had not conducted a data protection impact assessment prior to the processing in question, which would have identified the high risk associated with it.

The investigation revealed that data breach occurred in 4 steps:

1) An existing or potential customer called customer service enquiring about an insurance offer. The customer service representative sent an SMS or email to the customer after the phone call ended.

2) This SMS or email contained a URL to an insurance offer on Trygg-Hansa’s website.

3) Trygg-Hansa's website contained additional links to documents with insurance information.

4) These documents contained URLs that were (able to be changed) on the website browser allowing access to other customers' documents.

Trygg-Hansa's backend database was therefore, accessible without requiring authentication, and anyone could browse private documents from other individuals by modifying in the URL the client ID number.","IMY found the data breach to compromise (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR). The processing operation carried a high risk and would have required equivalent security levels. Appropriate technical and organizational measures (TOMs), as prescribed in Article 32 GDPR, were not implemented.

The long duration of the data breach combined with the very detailed records (including largely descriptive health data) underscores the severity of the incident. Analyses of behavioural patterns in the controller's logs indicated that 202 customers probably were directly affected. This means that their personal data were leaked and made accessible to non-authorised third parties.

IMY stated that data subjects expectations of high degrees of confidentiality are justified, especially in this case, where personal data was collected to make decisions about the insurance of registered individuals. Nevertheless, the controller failed to implement adequate authorisation control, encryption, logging, and access control, to remedy these technical shortcomings. The breach was of such an elementary character, that Trygg-Hansa should have identified and remedied the compromised system before it was implemented.

The investigation established that no routine was in place to verify the identity of persons making data access requests. Lack of pseudonymisation meant that individual accounts were accessible in plain text to a broad audience simply by rendering a few digits of a numeric URL sub-string. Once obtained, these individual records could have easily been distributed.

TOMs were implemented only after IMY contacted the controller about the data breach, and were found not to exceed minimum expectations. As such, they did not positively impact the calculation of the administrative fine.

Because the violation only concerned the Swedish branch of the company, the administrative fine was calculated based on the reported annual turnover of Moderna Försäkringar and not the parent company. The Swedish DPA fined Trygg-Hansa SEK 35 million (around €3 million) for breaching Article 5(1) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 58, Article 83"
"On 3-5 May 2022, as part of the control of marketing and profiling activities conducted by telephone companies, an inspection was directed at Tiscali Italia S.p.A. (the “Controller”).

During the investigation, the Italian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found several issues concerning, among the others, the controller’s disclosure and consent for data processing, the call back service by pop-up, the use of so-called ""soft spam"", the management of denials and objections to processing and the data retention for marketing and profiling purposes.

Following the investigation, on 23 June 2022, the controller sent a note to the DPA explaining the work carried out to address the criticisms raised. Thus, on 14 October 2022, the DPA requested further information and proof of the changes carried out.","Following the documents provided by the controller, the DPA concluded the following on each point of contention:

On the disclosure and consent for data processing: Violation of the principles of fairness and transparency, as stipulated by Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, Article 12(1) GDPR, as well as Article 13(2) GDPR due to the lack of information on the period of data retention for marketing purposes and of the underlying profiling.

Secondly, on the call back service by pop-up: No violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and Article 12(1) GDPR , given that the controller addressed the inconsistencies between the consent acquired through the call-back pop-up and that explained in the information notice.

Thirdly, on the use of so-called ""soft spam"": Violation of Article 130(4) of the Italian Privacy Code since the controller was sending promotional text messages rather than e-mails to customers who had not given consent for marketing purposes.

Fourthly, on the management of denials and objections to processing: Violation of Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24 GDPR as although the controller acknowledged the objections, it did not make alterations to appropriately handle a system listing the changes in the customers´ consent given.

And lastly, on data retention for marketing and profiling purposes: Violation of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR since data retention related to marketing until the withdrawal of consent to processing is also not compliant with Article 7 GDPR, and the controller´s terms of data retention were considered excessively long.

The DPA fined the controller €100,000 under Article 58(2)(i) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24"
"In 2021, the Dutch and French DPAs asked the Irish DPA to provide mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 GDPR in the context of the processing activities undertaken by TikTok, the controller. The Irish DPA was Leading Supervisory Authority (LSA) under Article 56 GDPR.

TikTok allegedly processed personal data of children in lack of sufficient identification mechanisms and implementing user settings that were not private. In particular, TikTok did not identify children under the age of 13 and made social media contents of all minors public-by-default.","National procedure leading to the Irish Draft Decision

First, the Irish DPA assessed whether TikTok’s default settings complied with the principles of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR), integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR) and privacy by design and by default (Article 25 GDPR). These principles should be complied with by means of appropriate technical and organisational measures (Article 24 GDPR).

The Irish DPA noted that new TikTok users were presented with a pop-up window where they could choose between ‘Go Private’ or ‘Skip’. If the user decided to skip, their account was made public by default. The DPA also stressed that TikTok’s privacy policy lacked transparency concerning the processing of minors’ data. Therefore, the controller violated the above-mentioned provisions.

Second, the DPA examined whether age verification mechanisms were sufficient to guarantee compliance with the same provisions mentioned above.

TikTok asked users to confirm their date of birth via an age gate. Children who used a date of birth that showed they were less than 13 were blocked and did not have a second opportunity to create an account. TikTok did not require ID documents (‘hard identifiers’) to be uploaded. However, TikTok declared to have removed children below 13 after reports by other users.

Aware of that fact that no age verification mechanism is sufficient to fully guarantee that children below 13 do not have access to the service, the DPA embraced a risk-based approach. According to the DPA, Tiktok never assessed the existence of these risks in its DPIA. However, the DPA also acknowledged that the controller put in place several measures – most of which are blackened in the text of the decision, but including content moderation – to prevent children below 13 from accessing its services. In light of the above, the DPA initially found no violation with regard to this point.

Third, the DPA found that TikTok did not comply with transparency requirements pursuant to Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, in particular because the privacy policy did not explain the implications of the public-by-default option. However, the DPA did not identify a broader violation of the principle of transparency (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR).

Relevant and reasoned objections by other DPAs and consistency mechanism

The Irish DPA adopted a Draft Decision under Article 60(3) GDPR and other supervisory authorities raised relevant and reasonable objections pursuant paragraph (4) of the same provision. As it was not possible to reach consensus concerning the age verification mechanism, the Irish DPA referred the case to the EDPB in order to apply the consistency mechanism (Article 63 GDPR).

The relevant and reasonable objections concerned the age verification mechanism and the use of dark patterns by TikTok.

Concerning the age verification mechanism, the EDPB stressed that the principle of ‘appropriateness’ is strictly related to the principle of ‘effectiveness’. The EDPB noted how the age verification gate could be easily dodged, as also shown by the high number of TikTok users below 13. According to Article 25(1) GDPR, measures taken by the controller should take into account the ‘state of the art’ of technology at a given time. The EDPB endorsed the Italian DPA’s statement according to which age verification can be effectively performed with the help of a ‘trusted third party’. However, the EDPB considered not to have conclusive information to ascertain the ‘state of the art’ of age verification technologies during the period taken into account by the investigation. Therefore, despite serious doubts about the effectiveness of the measures, the EDPB could not ascertain the existence of a violation concerning this point.

Concerning the use of ‘dark patterns’, the EDPB stressed that the Irish DPA took into account only potential violations of the principle of transparency, ignoring the principle of fairness, which is also established by Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The EDPB found that TikTok violated such a principle by ‘nudging’ users to accept non-private options in several ways.

The EDPB adopted a binding decision and the Irish DPA had to amend its draft decision accordingly.

In light of the above, the Irish DPA ordered TikTok to bring its processing activities in compliance with the GDPR. The DPA also issued a €345 million administrative fine.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 60, Article 63"
"Between 8 March 2019 and 2 September 2022, the Office of the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman (DPA) received numerous complaints concerning the Finnish Business Register, a business search service provided by Suomen Avainsanat Oy (the controller).

The data subject, in particular, claimed that following a request for a call recording, the controller only a summary of the call, that did not fully reflect the previous conversation. Following a repeated request for a call recording, the controller did not provide anything.

The DPA requested clarification from the controller, who explained that it kept the recordings for 2-4 months and that at the time of the submission of the clarification, it no longer kept the recording of the calls with the data subjects.

The DPA then contacted the data subjects concerned, who agreed to close the case if the DPA conducted its own initiative investigation since numerous cases brought against one controller could be considered an indication of an established behaviour of the controller.

An investigation therefore started the scope of which was to assess the controller's general data protection practices.","The DPA concluded the following.

The DPA ruled that the controller's action breached the data subjects’ right of access and right of copy in accordance with Article 12(1) GDPR and Article 15(3) GDPR. The controller provided the data subject with a summary of the telephone call, which was merely a general description of the call. Moreover, it did not indicate which personal data concerning the data subjects were processed. To comply with the right of access of the data subjects, it should have provided a copy of the data it had been processing. Thus, the summary provided could not be considered a copy, and the controller's established practice of exercising the right of access was not in compliance with the GDPR.

In the context of the extended ex officio investigation, the DPA also found a violation of Article 12(6) GDPR and Article 12(2) GDPR on facilitating the exercise of the rights of the data subject and verifying the identity of the data subject. Indeed, the DPA stated that the controller should have allowed data subjects’ access requests to be made electronically, in particular where personal data are processed electronically, and it may request additional information from the data subjects to identify them when it has reasonable grounds to doubt their identity. However, in the present case, the controller required the data subject to submit a written, signed request and to provide a copy of an identity document, even though the controller did not already process information on the signature of the data subjects and did not have a legitimate reason of requesting an identification document for the identification.

The DPA fined the controller €23,000 under Article 58(2)(i) GDPR and Article 83(6) GDPR, as the controller did not provide information on its turnover of 2022, and the sanction was estimated based on the confirmed turnover of 2021.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 58, Article 83"
"The staff of the Danish region of Zealand had access to a health database concerning patients treated by public hospitals. The database contains names, addresses, social security numbers and health data. The Region claimed that the access by staff members was necessary to perform multidisciplinary administrative tasks and improve efficiency. The Region also stressed that staff members were subject to professional secrecy obligations.

The Danish DPA started an ex officio investigation.","The DPA clarified that the Region of Zealand was the controller in the case at issue. According to Article 32 GDPR, the controller shall implement technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks concerning the processing.

The DPA stressed that access to personal data follows the principle of data minimisation and should be limited to those data that are strictly necessary to perform job-related tasks. The DPA did not disregard the argument that efficient health services require extensive processing activities by public administrations. However, the controller had to check that only staff members whose tasks were related to health services had access to the files. In this case, the database was accessible to a large number of people – actually more than 16,000. This was clearly disproportionate in light of Article 32 GDPR.

Moreover, the DPA found that the controller did not keep a record of the log-ins to the database by their employees. Therefore, it was not possible to monitor whether such a broad access was in practice only theoretical or members of the staff made excessive use of the tool. Thus, the controller could not prove compliance with the Regulation.

In light of the above, the DPA reprimanded the controller pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"The controller, the City Hall of Albeni (Gorj county, Romania) had implemented a CCTV system through which all employees of the City Hall were monitored and screened by the City Hall Mayor. The Romanian DPA opened an investigation following a complaint concerning the CCTV system.

During the investigation, it was found that the controller had failed to comply with previous measures imposed by the DPA during the course of its investigation. As a result, the DPA found violations of Articles 13, 14 and 32 GDPR.

In accordance with the provisions of Law 190/2013, in response to GDPR breaches committed by public authorities (such as the case of the City Hall), the Romanian DPA must first issue a record of findings and penalties with respect to the breach, as well as a warning, and submit a remediation plan (entailing correspondent measures and a deadline for remediation). Following the expiry of the remediation term, the Romanian DPA may resume the investigation to verify the fulfillment of the remediation measures imposed. In the current case, the Romanian DPA had submitted a remediation plan to the controller during the course of their investigation.","Following the expiry of the remediation term, it was found that the controller had failed to demonstrate that they had informed their employees (the data subjects) of their rights under the GDPR and failed to adopt the appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure secure processing through the CCTV video system.

"The Irish DPC started an own volition inquiry into processing operations carried out by the Galway County Council (the controller), focusing mainly into the surveillance technologies deployed by state authorities, including the Galway County Council and by the An Garda Síochána (the Irish police).

More specifically, the Galway County Council Officials make use of CCTV systems, body-worn cameras and automated number plate recognition (ANPR) technologies for various purposes including law enforcement purposes. The DPC carried out its assessment both on the basis of the GDPR and of the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) for activities meant to prevent, investigate, detect and prosecute crime or for the execution of criminal penalties.","In its inquiry, the DPC assessed the legitimacy of processing activities by the controller in light of both the GDPR and the Irish Data Protection Act and the LED, as different processing activities pursued different purposes. The DPC held with respect to body-worn cameras and ANPR systems that the GDPR applies to these processing activities as they mainly serve health and safety and traffic management purposes respectively, thus no law enforcement purposes. Making reference to the strict interpretation in CJEU jurisprudence, the DPC held that in order for a processing activity to fall under the scope of the LED, it must be specifically and concretely used for law enforcement purposes and it does not suffice that the data could potentially (emphasis added) be processed for law enforcement purposes.

Firstly, as regards ANPR cameras used for traffic management, the DPC held that the latter enable identification of data subjects within the vehicle and thus constitutes processing of personal data. The legal basis referred to by the Council is Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. The DPC held that processing ex Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, read in light of Article 6(3) GDPR and Recital 41 GDPR requires a legal basis to set out the conditions for processing clearly, precisely and in a foreseeable way. In this case, the DPC held that the use of ANPR cameras does aid to the traffic management function of officials but it may also have significant impacts on the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The DPC concluded that the national provisions relied on by the controller to make use of such cameras are too broad and cannot constitute a legal basis for the Council to deploy APNR cameras for traffic management purposes. Hence, the DPC found the Council had acted in violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

In addition to this, the DPC considered whether the controller complied with its Article 24(1) GDPR obligation to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate GDPR-compliant processing activities, also by means of a data protection policy as per Article 24(2) GDPR. The DPC held that the controller failed to comply with its obligation under Article 24(1) GDPR with respect to the use of ANPR cameras for traffic management purposes as it failed to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.

Further, the DPC also found the controller had failed to comply with its obligation to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment by virtue of Article 35(1) GDPR for the use of APNR cameras for the systematic monitoring, tracking and observing of individuals.

Secondly, the DPC considered the use of a body-worn camera by a Housing Tenacy Officer who had been threatened while conducting official activities. The legal basis relied upon by the Council in this case was Article 6(1)(d) GDPR, which allows for processing activities that are necessary to protect the vital interest of an individual. Further the Council also relied on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR as it is required to comply with health and safety obligations towards its employees set out in two specific Acts. As regards the use of body-worn cameras on the basis of Article 6(1)(d) GDPR, the DPC held that the controller failed to carry out a test for proving the necessity of the use of such cameras before their actual use. Hence, the controller failed to prove that such measure was necessary to protect the vital interest of the officer or to perform a task in the public interest. As for the use of such cameras on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, the DPC held that again the controller did not rely on a clear, precise and foreseeable provision in the law allowing specifically for the body-worn cameras to be used. In this case too, the DPC held that the Council had infringed Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

Lastly, the DPC held that the controller infringed Article 24(1) GDPR to the extent that it failed to raise staff awareness on the principles of data processing, which counts as an organizational measure to be adopted by the controller under Article 24(1) GDPR.

With respect to all the above mentioned violations, the DPC decided to adopt the following corrective powers: it provisionally banned the use of body-worn cameras and APNR cameras until a valid legal basis is identified and issued a reprimand concerning the violation of Article 24 GDPR.

The rest of the activities carried out by the Galway County Council were assessed in light of the provisions of the LED, and the DPC found several violations in that respect too.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 35"

First, the AZOP held that, failing to prove the existence of a legal basis for processing of personal data of the visitors of their websites through the use of cookies, the controllers acted contrary to Article 6(1) GDPR.

In this, the controllers also failed to collect valid consents by the data subjects visiting their web pages.

"The DPA received an anonymous petition stating that EOS Matrix had unauthorized processing of a large number of personal data (of debtors). A USB stick containing 181,641 personal data of natural persons in the structure of first and last name, date of birth and OIB, who had outstanding debts to initial creditors that were purchased by EOS Matrix based on the cession agreement. Likewise, in the petition, it was stated that the database also includes 294 natural persons who were minors at the time.","DPA has concluded:  1. The controller did not take appropriate technical measures to protect the processing of the personal data contained in the storage systems, which is contrary to Article 32 paragraph 1 point b) and paragraph 2 of the GDPR; 2. The controller processed the personal data of respondents who are not in a debtor-creditor relationship in their database without the existence of a legal basis from Article 6, paragraph 1 of the GDPR; 3. The controller processed special category (health data) in its database without the existence of a legal basis from Article 6, paragraph 1, and in connection with this, Article 9, paragraph 2 of the GDPR; 4. The data controller did not inform the data subjects in a transparent and prescribed manner about the processing of their health data in the privacy policies, which is contrary to Article 12 paragraph 1 of the GDPR and, in this regard, to Article 13 paragraphs 1 and 2; 5. For the recording of telephone conversations with data subjects in the period from May 25, 2018 to January 16, 2019, the data controller did not have an established legal basis from Article 6, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, and in this connection there was also a violation of Article 5, paragraph 2; 6. The controller did not inform the data subjects in an understandable and clear way about the processing of personal data in the form of recording telephone conversations, and thus acted contrary to Article 12, paragraph 1 of the GDPR.

Regarding the point 1 it was determined that the data controller did not implement sufficient TOM that could timely recognize in the processing system (the main database in which personal data of about 370,000 data subjects are processed) activities that deviate from the usual ones (e.g. increased number of retrievals data in the database, transfer of data outside the system, compromise of user access, etc.). Precisely because of deficiencies in the security system, the insecure processing of personal data on a large scale number of respondents, and the company lost control over the movement of data and could not explain the causes or methods of data exfiltration.

It was established that EOS Matrix also processed data of data subjects who are not debtors nor legal representative (most often telephone number and first and last name and residential address).

Regarding the processing of health data, it was established that EOS Matrix, after communication with respondents, actively recorded comments related to the debtor's state of health in the internal database. Particularly worrying is the situation where the health condition of the subjects was monitored down to the details of individual diagnoses, which included terminal illnesses, and which almost exposes privacy to the maximum level to persons who are authorized to access the application (database) used by EOS Matrix employees. The arguments of EOS Matrix was that data subject had provided such information. DPA stressed that this does not mean that the same can be actively entered into the database. As a result of the above, it cannot be considered that there is an exception for the processing of health data from Article 9, paragraph 2, point e) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the reference to the legal basis regarding the execution of the contract, as well as the legitimate interest (which was referred to by the company in question) cannot be a legal basis either, since the processing of health data is not necessary to achieve the intended purpose. If the goal is better collection towards the debtor and avoidance of communication due to the health condition, then the same purpose could be achieved by recording a general comment about the need to avoid contact for a certain period of time due to the personal condition of the debtor, without highlighting precise health data.

Also, and related to the processing of health data, it was determined that EOS Matrix defined that it does not and will not process health data. This method resulted in non-transparent processing of data.

Also, in the period from May 25, 2018 to January 16, 2019, the data of 49,850 data subjects were processed, i.e. telephone conversations were recorded without determining the legal basis. The test of legitimate interest was conducted on January 16, 2019.

Furthermore, regarding the recording of telephone conversations, it was established that EOS Matrix since 2014 has been using the functionality of recording telephone conversations with debtors, but indicating that the conversation ""may"" be recorded.

It has not been determined how exactly 181,641 personal data were exfiltrated, and considering that in this specific case it is a question of the possible commission of the criminal offense of unauthorized use of personal data and criminal offenses against computer systems, programs and data, and also under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. The DPA actively cooperates with the Zagreb Police Department and the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney's Office, which conduct investigative activities.

As a result of the above, it was undoubtedly established that the personal data submitted to the DPA via USB stick were excluded from the database of EOS Matrix!",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32"
"In December 2019, the DSB received an anonymous submission claiming that a controller had installed GPS-trackers on its company vehicles, monitoring not only business trips but also private rides of the its employees. Further, the complaint stated that the controller would create an employee profile based on such data.

Accordingly, the DSB started an ex officio investigation under Article 57(1)(h) GDPR and obtained evidence about the following facts: the controller leased 15 company vehicles from a leasing provider and put them at its employees’ disposal for both business and private trips. In 2020, the controller asked a third party company to install a GPS-tracking device on every vehicle. Initially, this was used to determine the current location of the vehicle when asked; from July 2021 onwards, the GPS-system has also been used as a tool for keeping record of working hours, business trips and for calculating travel expenses. The device placed on the vehicles transmits data to a server and is activated by starting the car’s engine and it is deactivated as the engine stops. However, each car also includes a switch allowing the driver to deactivate the device manually. The transmitted data includes: covered distance in km, date and time, starting point, destination and location data of the vehicle (and the actual route covered). The controller has knowledge about some of this data (the address of, arrival and departure from the customers’ premises) thanks to the coordinators who organize business trips and assign them to the employees on a daily basis, hence without the need to access the data collected by the tracking devices. In order to access to the data generated by the tracking devices, one must log into a software app. The only employees who have these credentials are those responsible for payroll accounting and financial management and the coordinators.  Externally, the company that installed the devices, as a processor, also has access to such data.

The controller submitted that it is both under a legal obligation to process real-time location data of some of its employees in accordance with Article 6(1)(c) GDPR and it also has a legitimate interest to do so under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.","The DSB assessed whether the choice of legal bases by the controller was justified.

First, as regards the existence of a legitimate interest, the DSB held that the legitimate interest of the controller must be weighed against the right of the employees to data protection. The DSB considered the controller's interest in using the GPS-tracking device in order to correctly calculate the hours worked, the expenses incurred during a journey etc. that will allow it to compensate its employees accordingly. On top of this, the controller has an economic interest in compensating its employees rationally, and making sure that traffic and longer routes are avoided. Moreover, the controller claimed it has an interest in knowing the real-time location of its employees in case it needs to spontaneously send them to a client in need, with a view to fulfilling its responsibilities towards its clients. Finally, since the controller does not own the cars but is leasing them, it also calimed a legitimate interest in being be able to locate the vehicles in real time to make sure they are not stolen or damaged.

On the other hand, lies the interest of the employees not to be monitored during working hours.

Making reference to the CJEU Judgment in case C-708/18, the DSB recognized that the second requirement for establishing a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is the necessity of processing for realising the controller’s interests, which should be limited to what is strictly necessary. In this, it needs to be ascertained whether the same purpose can be achieved by using less intrusive means.

In light of all this, the DSB held that since the controller could have knowledge of the employees’ location by asking the internal coordinators what client they had been assigned to, it was not necessary for the controller to make use of the GPS-tracking devices in order to access their real-time location. Further, since most of the business trips involved the delivery of single spare parts, the controller could not claim that it would need to know its employees’ current location for spontaneous trips, as employees cannot spontaneously go to another client without the required spare part. In addition to this, the DSB found no valid reason to claim that the use of tracking devices would be necessary in order to substantively facilitate the controller’s administrative duty of recording working hours and calculating travel expenses, as this could easily be carried out without making use of the GPS-trackers. Finally, the controller failed to provide evidence of the need to prevent the leased vehicles from being damaged or stolen. Accordingly, the DSB held that in the present case, lacking the necessity requirement for processing, the controller could not rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for processing personal data of its employees through the use of tracking devices.

As regards the existence of a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, according to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, the DSB held that even where a legal obligation is given, the processing shall still occur in accordance with the principles of processing enshrined in Article 5(1) GDPR. In this case, the controller relied on a provision from the Austrian Law on working time, which obliges employers to keep a precise and complete record of hours worked by its employees, allowing also the use of digital devices. In the controller’s view, using a GPS-tracking device would allow it to obtain more precise, correct and immediate data about the hours worked by its employees. The DSB, however, underlined that the GPS-tracker has only been used for recording working time from July 2021 onwards and before that, everything was noted down manually and the controller did not provide any evidence that this had lead to wrong or imprecise data about working time. As a consequence, the DSB held that the controller could not rely on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR as a legal basis for processing, since the purpose of such processing could also be achieved through less intrusive means in line with the principle of data minimization of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

Hence, the DSB held that, by tracking 15 company vehicles used by its employees without a valid legal basis for processing, the controller acted in violation of the GDPR. The DSB thus ordered the controller to immediately stop all processing operations carried out through the use of the GPS-tracking system in question.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6"
"The DPA opened an investigation against an energy company, Restart Energy One S.A. (the controller), after receiving a complaint regarding a data breach on the company's website.

In particular, it ordered the controller to bring its processing operations into compliance by implementing the appropriate security standards to ensure that data subjects' information is no longer publicly accessible. It also ordered the controller to bring its cookie system into compliance with Law 506/2004.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"In May 2022, the controller, a local business owner, fell victim to a data breach. A file containing the personal data of her clients was stolen from her computer. The stolen data included names, home and email addresses, telephone numbers and national identification numbers of the data subjects.

The controller informed the Polish DPA about this incident but did not reveal any details as to whether the data subjects had been informed about the data breach or whether any risk to their rights and freedoms existed as a result of it. Moreover, the controller contacted the DPA after the 72-hour period prescribed by Article 33(1) GDPR. The DPA requested clarifications but did not receive an answer.

Consequently, in September 2022 the DPA initiated an ex officio investigation regarding the controller's handling of the data breach.","The Polish DPA found that the controller was in breach of Article 33(1) GDPR, Article 33(3) GDPR, Articles 34(1) and 34(2) GDPR, and Article 5(2) GDPR,

Firstly, the Polish DPA held that the controller violated Article 33(1) GDPR as they failed to notify the DPA of the breach within the 72-hour time limit. The controller had also breached Article 33(3) GDPR because the notification did not include all the information required by the provision.

Secondly, the DPA established that the controller had not carried out an assessment as to whether there was a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects as a result of the data breach. Moreover, the controller did not inform the data subjects of the data breach. The DPA noted that, in this context, the assessment of the risk under Article 34 GDPR, should be made through the lens of the data subject rather than the interests of the controller, as data subjects must be sufficiently informed to make their own assessment of whether a data breach is likely to cause negative consequences and decide whether to take the appropriate remedial action. Taking into account the nature of personal data stolen, the DPA concluded that there was indeed a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Hence, they should have been notified of the data breach without undue delay. By not fulfilling this obligation, the controller violated Articles 34(1) and 34(2) GDPR.

Thirdly, the DPA noted that the controller had failed to reply to the requests for clarification and demonstrate that they had carried out of a risk assessment following the data breach. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of the principle of accountability (Article 5(2) GDPR).

As a result, the Polish DPA imposed a €2,640 fine on the controller for the violations of Article 33(1) GDPR, Article 33(3) GDPR, Articles 34(1) and 34(2) GDPR, and Article 5(2) GDPR. Moreover, in line with Articles 34(4) and 58(1)(a) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to properly notify the data subjects of the data breach within 3 days from the date of the DPA's decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 33, Article 34"
"Between November 2019 and January 2021, the French DPA received 31 complaints relating to ‘cold’ calls, a form of sales solicitation by phone from businesses to customers who have never interacted with the business before, and issues with the complainants’ exercise of their rights by GROUPE CANAL+ (the company), which specialises in the publishing of channels and the distribution of pay-TV offerings. Five of these complaints have been upheld in the present proceedings. Specifically, two of the complainants claimed that their right to erasure had not been complied with, and a third complainant stated that his request for an objection to the processing had also been disregarded.

Thus, in January 2021, the DPA held an online inspection of the processing operations carried out by the company, and in March 2023, a rapporteur was appointed to examine the documents.

At the end of the investigation, on 11 May 2023, the company was sent a report detailing the breaches of Article 12 GDPR, Article 13 GDPR, Article 14 GDPR, Article 15 GDPR, Article 28 GDPR, Article 32 GDPR and Article 33 GDPR, as well as of Article L. 34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code (the CPCE). Following this, the company submitted additional observations, and on 14 September 2023, the rapporteur and the company presented oral observations to the DPA.","Following the meeting, the French DPA first found that the company had electronic commercial canvassing operations carried out on its behalf by service providers and was unable to provide proof of validly expressed consent by prospective customers to be ‘cold’ called. The data from these prospects came from the service providers, but the prospective costumers did not validly consent to receive 'cold' calls from the company, as they were not informed of the identity of the canvasser on whose behalf the consent was collected when ticking the box to consent to receive commercial canvassing by electronic means. Additionally, when the company did not collect consent directly from the prospective customers, it was the company's responsibility to obtain such consent before carrying out any canvassing activity. And pursuant to Article 7(1) GDPR, the company must be able to prove that it had such consent. Thus, the company failed to comply with its obligations arising from Article L. 34-5 of the French CPCE and Article 7(1) GDPR, as clarified by Article 4(11) GDPR.

Secondly, the DPA found no breach of Article 13 GDPR as the company's privacy policy was amended and clarified the data retention period. And even if there was no mention of the right to lodge a complaint with the French DPA in the company's privacy policy, this could be understood by the compilation of several documents, accessible from the website.

Moreover, regarding the information provided to prospective customers during ‘cold’ calls, the DPA established a breach of Article 14 GDPR since when the company collected a telephone number from a third party for ‘cold’ calls, it should have informed the person of the purpose of the data processing or the existence of various rights, while the costumers were not always made aware of this.

Fourthly, based on the complaints lodged by three complainants, the DPA considered that the company had failed to comply with its obligations under Article 12 GDPR. The DPA noted that the requests made by the complainants were clear and addressed directly to the company's DPO. However, the company failed to provide the data subjects with information on the measures taken in response to their requests within a maximum period of one month under Article 12(3) GDPR, confirming a breach of Article 12 GDPR. Taking this last consideration, the DPA noted that it was clear from the information gathered that the complainants' requests had been received by the company, meaning that it failed to fulfil its obligations to process the requests, failing to comply with Article 15 GDPR.

Additionally, the DPA addressed the company’s contract with its processor. During the inspections, the DPA found that all the relevant information under Article 28 GDPR was present. However, the document was amended without communicating this to the DPA, and not all the information required under Article 28(3) GDPR was included. The DPA noted that the new documents now contain all the necessary information. Nonetheless, it considered that the past processing operations still failed to comply with Article 28(3) GDPR.

The DPA also found safety obligations issues and a breach of Article 32 GDPR as it noted that the company should have implemented a robust authentication policy as a basic security measure to keep passwords secure and comply with the Articles' obligations. Meanwhile the MD4 algorithm used by the company to store employee passwords at the time of the inspections was obsolete and insufficiently robust to ensure the confidentiality of passwords. According to the DPA, it had been known for years that the MD4 algorithm is subject to vulnerability and is immediately exploitable by attackers.

Lastly, the DPA addressed the company’s failure to comply with the obligation to notify the DPA of a personal data breach. Indeed, on 5 February 2020, the company was informed by subscribers of a data breach as subscribers accessing their account were able to view information relating to other subscribers, such as their postal address and telephone number. The DPA noted that 10,154 people were affected by the breach, not a negligible number, and since the breach was likely to infringe on subscribers' right to privacy, the company should have notified the DPA of the personal data breach. Thus, there had been a breach of Article 33 GDPR.

Due to the numerous breaches committed, some structural and certainly serious while others less severe and taking into consideration as mitigating factors the measures taken by the company, which has brought itself into compliance on certain points, the French DPA fined the company €600,000, on the basis of Article 83 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 28, Article 32, Article 33"
"On 3 April 2023, the applicant requested the local Police Station (the controller) to delete from its website the information concerning her disappearance, as well as from the websites of the media outlets that had picked up the news from the police website.

In a reply dated 6 April 2023, the controller explained that her requests could not be granted because they were not responsible for the content and its deletion from the other online portals.

Thus, the applicant filed a complaint to the Slovenian DPA against the controller, and the DPA then began its proceedings by conducting two calls with the controller.

The controller confirmed to the DPA that it had removed the applicant's data from its website since its publication was no longer necessary for the purpose of the search for this person. It further explained to have ensured compliance, after the proceedings started, by also communicating to all media outlets that still had news of the applicant's disappearance published online that the applicant had requested the deletion of her personal data. In the notification, the controller had explained to the media outlets that this was a submission of an erasure request, which they had to comply with in accordance with the GDPR.","The Slovenian DPA held that the controller violated Article 17(2) GDPR, which regulates the right to be forgotten. In accordance with this provision, upon receiving a deletion request, the controller should have taken reasonable steps to inform the controllers to whom the applicant's personal data had been forwarded that the applicant requested the deletion of her personal data.

In the present case, it was clear that the applicant wished to have her information removed as soon as possible from the internet. Thus, the controller should have complied with Article 17(2) GDPR by sending a notification to every media outlet that published the missing person's details stating that the applicant had requested erasure of the information.

Hence, the DPA found that at the time of the submission of the notification on 6 April 2023, the controller was in breach of Article 17(2) GDPR. However, in the course of the proceedings before the DPA, the controller demonstrated its commitment to ensuring compliance with the GDPR, followed the findings of the DPA and remedied the infringement of Article 17(2) GDPR. Therefore, the DPA decided not to impose additional measures on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 17
"Following a visit to the premises of two public bodies (the joint controllers), the agents of the Luxembourgish DPA found that the controllers applied a geo-localisation system on the companies' service vehicles and construction machines. Even though the system was not connected to the drivers, through the timesheets, which indicated which driver used which vehicle or machine, it was easy to find out which employee used which vehicle on which day.

On 13 December 2022, at the end of the investigation, a statement of objection was published by the rapporteur detailing breaches of Article 13 GDPR, Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. Following this, the joint controllers submitted observations, and on 13 June 2023, the rapporteur and the joint controllers presented oral observations to the DPA.","Regarding the obligation to provide information, pursuant to Article 13 GDPR, the DPA considered that for data processing by an employer to be considered lawful, the data subjects must be informed of the monitoring, in accordance with Article 12 GDPR and Article 13 GDPR.

The joint controller had provided the employees information notes and e-mails in French and German in the vehicles and machines and on the Intranet. However, the DPA found that there had been non-compliance with Article 13 GDPR as the joint controllers did not provide all compulsory information. Namely the identity of the controllers and the DPO, the legal basis, the legitimate interests followed, the appropriate safeguards applied, and the rights of the data subjects to receive a copy and to submit a complaint to the supervisory authority. The information notes also contained the Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer of personal data to the US - even though it was invalidated by the Court of Justice. Moreover, the content of the French and German versions was not identical.

Secondly, in relation to Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, the DPA found that the joint controllers did not comply with the principle of data minimisation. The geolocation system was installed to track staff working in dangerous conditions or alone, to prevent the theft of vehicles and machines and to verify employees' working time. However, the system was used both during and outside working hours and did not have a deactivation button.

In addition, it found that the controllers did not comply with the principle of purpose limitations under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. The joint controllers' reasoning that the materials transported by the machines and vehicles, dirt and rocks, were of a special nature could not justify the use of geolocation.

The DPA issued a fine of €2,500. It took into account the gravity of the violation, its duration (as the tracking system was deactivated during the proceedings) and the number of data subjects concerned (one-third of the employees). It also considered that the violation was not intentional, that interim measures had been taken and that the joint controllers did not financially benefit from the violation.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5

During the investigation, the DPA found that personal data pertaining to a petitioner were sent by e-mail to another individual. The DPA considered that the controller did not adopt sufficient security measures in accordance with Article 32 GDPR, situation which led to the occurrence of a data breach which affected the personal data of the petitioner.  Also, the DPA found that the financial institution failed to notify the respective data breach to the DPA, in violation of Article 33 GDPR.","The DPA imposed a fine of EUR 3,0000 for breach of Article 32 GDPR and a warning for breach of Article 33 GDPR. Also, the DPA imposed corrective measures to the financial institution in order to ensure compliance of data processing operations with GDPR, as follows: (a) to implement technical and organizational security measures appropriate to the specifics of the processing and the risks identified, throughout the data processing cycle, in particular in terms of verifying the accuracy of the processed personal data, establishing appropriate rules related to the drafting and management of files that can be transmitted using electronic means of communication (remote), training of personnel processing personal data on behalf and under the authority of the financial institution, regular verification of compliance with instructions given to said personnel, automation of certain processes to reduce the risks of unlawful or unauthorized processing of personal data; and (b) to adopt internal measures necessary for the rapid detection, management and reporting of personal data breaches (whether or not they require notification to the supervisory authority and/or data subjects), as well as by appropriate and regular training of personnel acting on behalf and under the authority of the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 33"

"The Danish company Mindworking A/S offers an all-in-one platform for the real estate industry, acting as a processor. On 4 November 2021, the real estate agent notified the processor about a security flaw in the platform (dating back to when the platform was launched in 2019), which had been flagged through an anonymous tip by a customer.

Through developer tools, users could view confidential data in the webpage source code, including personal data such as real estate agents' personal notes, names of potential buyers, price offers and contracts. The processor could not rule out that some documents contained social security numbers. To access the data, though, users had to create an account, be logged into the platform and have access to a specific case.

The processor investigated the error and fixed it the same day, on 4 November 2021. It stated that the incident was caused by a security error it was not aware of, which is why no technical or organisational measures had been preventively taken to prevent this issue.

Between 8 and 12 November 2021, the Danish DPA received personal data breach reports from 65 controllers who used the platform provided by the processor. On 11 November, after an initial dialogue with the DPA, the processor itself reported the data breach to the DPA. The DPA then launched an independent investigation.","Considering the facts of the case, the DPA noted that, on the basis of Article 32(1) GDPR, data controllers and processors must identify the risks associated with the processing of personal data and implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security. This means that possible error scenarios should be tested when developing new applications where the personal data of a large number of users is processed. Therefore, the DPA described the security flaw as ""commonly known and elementary"" and pointed out that the processor should have tested the platform better before its launch, which would likely have uncovered the flaw.

"A Danish citizen lodged a complaint with the Danish DPA regarding the Danish Agency for Digital Government's (the controller) processing of his personal data in their Driving Licence app, which he had not registered for or used.

The app is a digital alternative to the physical driving licence and contains information about the licence holder's name, birth data, place of birth, nationality, licence number, passport number, passport photo, social security number, health, and data relating to criminal convictions and offences.

Following the complaint, on 7 September 2022, the DPA started an own-volition investigation of the matter. They found that the controller was processing the personal data of approximately 3.96 million Danish citizens with a driving licence, yet only 1.7 million had registered for the app, while the remaining group had not joined the app.

The controller attributed the excessive processing to technical constraints of the driving licence database, built on an outdated mainframe system, which gave it access to all valid Danish driving licenses. They explained to have initially considered three possible solutions for the app but deemed only the one adopted realistically viable. The one adopted complied with certain operational and performance requirements while allowing for the digital driving licence, updated with the latest information, to be made accessible to citizens. Consequently, they claimed that the processing was in line with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.","The DPA concluded that the controller violated the data minimisation principle of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. The principle should have been complied with despite the system being the only possible solution according to the current technical structure of the driving licence register. It further stated that the accessibility needs described by the controller and the mere fact that it is convenient for citizens to have the Driving Licence app, as they can leave their physical driving licence at home, cannot justify the processing in question. Thus, the DPA concluded that data processing of all holders of a valid Danish driving licence is not justifiable, as the controller was processing data of a very large number of people - approximately 2.26 million people - who had not actively joined the Driving Licence app.

Hence, the DPA issued serious criticism to the controller under Article 58(2)(b) GDPR. In addition, per Article 58(2)(f) GDPR, it banned the storing and processing of personal data about persons who have not actively joined the Driving Licence app.

During the investigation, the DPA found that customer data from the company's own software had been repeatedly accessed by the staff and used in an unauthorised manner. Moreover, the personal data of customers was disclosed for the purpose of obtaining loans in the data subject's name.

As a result of the data breach, personal data pertaining to controller’s customer data including data from the identity card (name, surname, series and number of the identity card, personal numerical code, address, place of birth, photo) and income statements (among the others,  name and surname of the employee, date, signature, income achieved, length of service) were unlawfully accessed and further disclosed for the above mentioned illicit purposes.","The DPA held that the controller was in breach of Articles 32(1)(b), 32(2) and 32(4) GDPR.

Firstly, the DPA held that the controller had breached Article 32(1)(b) GDPR (confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services) and Article 32(4) GDPR since the controller had not taken sufficient measures to ensure that individuals acting under its authority only had access to personal data processes at their request.

Secondly, the DPA found a breach of Article 32(2) GDPR. The controller had not appropriately assessed the risks of processing and had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing, which resulted in their customers' personal data being disclosed and used to obtain loans in the data subjects' name.

According to the Carabinieri station which reported to the DPA on 6th of July 2021, the surveillance system in question was capable of recording the public area in front of the party’s property, including a nearby playground and a public square.

Pursuant to to art. 157 of Legislative Decree no. 196 of 2003, containing the Code regarding the protection of personal data, the DPA opened a preliminary investigation.


During the investigation, carried out on 2 March 2023, the officers noted that the video surveillance system was made up of  two recording devices. First, pan-and-tilt camera that was active and it had the following features: possibility of 360° movement with capability to record images as well as audio and to speak through the microphone. The camera was positioned right above the entrance door. The party controlled the camera through the smartphone application. The second camera was connected but not active, and it was looking over the driveway that leads to the the entrance of the building. The party controlled the camera through the smartphone application.

In relation to the viewing angle of the cameras, the party declared that the system that records external images films the portion of the space in front the entrance and the immediately adjacent areas. She added that the camera which is positioned immediately above the access door, due to its characteristics, could also frame part of the playground, but it was not in her interest to do so. The purpose of the video surveillance was to confront the alleged threats that the party received.

Subsequently, the party took measures to bring the aforementioned processing in compliance with GDPR including replacing the pan-and-tilt camera with a fixed camera model pointed only towards the entrance of her property.","In the outcome of the investigation, the DPA considered whether GDPR applies to the processing of data carried out by Ms. XX. In principle, the use of video surveillance systems by natural persons in their private areas, for domestic purposes, as long as the viewing angle of the cameras is limited only to the areas of their relevance falls outside of the material scope of GDPR. This is provided that the scope of data communication does not exceed the owner's family sphere and the images are not communicated to third parties .

the DPA held that Ms. XX in carrying out processing of personal data did not comply with the relevant regulations on the protection of personal data contained in the GDPR. In particular, the processing of personal data carried out by the party is unlawful as it is carried out in a manner that does not comply with the principles of ""lawfulness"" and “minimization” of data. The party violated Article 5.1 and Article 6.1 GDPR considering the fact that the camera, due to its characteristics, was suitable for also framing part of the playground in front of Mrs. XX's home.

"On 9 November 2021, the DPA ordered the controller (Suomen Asiakastieto Oy, a consumer credit information service provider) to rectify its practices in registering payment default entries based on final decisions and to erase all incorrect payment default entries which had resulted from such practices. The controller was also ordered to submit a report of the measures which it had taken due to the order and to report the number of erased payment default entries to the DPA.

In its first report, the controller stated that it had changed its practice but argued that it was practically impossible for it to find and erase the entries related to disputed cases from its register retrospectively, since it had not been informed by the Legal Register Centre of which decisions had been delivered to it on inaccurate grounds.

In its second report, the controller stated that it had interpreted the DPA's order incorrectly and had now erased all payment default entries based on final decisions from its register. According to the controller, it was unclear whether the order only concerned the erasure of the payment default entries of the data subject who initiated the case or the erasure of all incorrect payment default entries.

The controller argued that it would be impossible to re-read all the decisions handed over to it, to re-evaluate the registration eligibility of each decision, assess whether the matter is possibly registered as a payment default entry and, if necessary, erase the entry after this assessment.","First, the DPA considered that it is clear from the order that the controller must erase all incorrect payment default entries resulting from its general practices. The DPA pointed out that the controller would have had the opportunity, if necessary, to request additional information about the order from the DPA.

Second, the DPA stated that the incorrect payment default entries could have been erased because the Legal Register Centre discloses payment default information based on final judgements to the controller in the format in which they are saved in the register of court decisions.

Third, the DPA held that by not complying with the order, the controller had avoided the costs in its business caused by the amount of work required to comply with the order.

"A Danish citizen brought a complaint to the Danish DPA concerning a picture of themselves being published on the Instagram account of Aarhus University Hospital (AUH). Based on this, on 19 December 2022, the DPA initiated an investigation against the Central Denmark Region (the controller).

During the investigation, the DPA found that the Instagram account regularly published photos and videos of daily life at AUH. It showed pictures of patients, staff and relatives, and the account has been active since June 2015; it had more than 15,000 followers and more than 1,400 posts. A review of the account also revealed that there were posts with pictures and information about patients dating back to 2016. In some cases, these included information on health conditions.

The controller explained that the information on the account is published to inform the outside world about the hospital’s activities and daily life. It further clarified that posts containing information about citizens, including patients, were published on the basis of consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR. Consent was obtained in writing before the publication of the post, and granting it or not did not affect the health treatment offered to the patient. The controller also stated that its processing met the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, as well as the principle of data minimisation pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, since they did not process personal data not necessary for the hospital purposes. To limit this, they also ensured that information such as social security numbers and names were be displayed on monitors, medical records and patient wristbands appearing in the pictures. Lastly, the controller claimed to observe also the principle of storage limitation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR since data subjects could make erasure requests.","The Danish DPA found that the data processed in this case could be considered health data, as the images in question were accompanied, in several cases, by information about the hospital department and what the patient was suffering from or was examined for.

Thus, explicit consent was needed under Article 9(2) GDPR and the conditions for consent pursuant to Article 4(11) GDPR had to be assessed in light of the relevant circumstances in which the consent was obtained. The DPA, hence, found that in situations where a patient is typically in a vulnerable position when hospitalised or being treated at a hospital, there are power asymmetries between the patient and the hospital and hospital staff, which could entail that the patient may have experienced pressure when requesting consent, affecting the patient's free choice. The DPA also clarified that under the GDPR public authorities’ processing of personal data cannot be based on consent due to the inherent unequal relationship between the controller and the citizen.

In light of this, the DPA found that the conditions under Article 4(11) GDPR were not met. Consequently, it found that the controller's processing of personal data in connection with the present investigation was not in accordance with Article 9(2)(a) GDPR and Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. Thus, the Danish DPA held that the processing was also not following the principles of Article 5(1) GDPR.

Against this background, the Danish DPA reprimanded the controller. Additionally, under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, it ordered the controller to delete posts containing health information about patients from the Instagram account within four weeks from the day of the decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 9"
"On 20 January 2022, the Danish DPA received an inquiry from a citizen about the Agency for Digital Government’s (the controller) use of JavaScript, a programming language, in connection with MitID, the Danish digital ID. In general, the inquiry stated that JavaScript is outdated and not safe and that devices can easily be hacked if JavaScript is enabled, as highlighted by leading security experts for many years.

The DPA decided to further investigate the issue and requested the controller to present statements regarding the processing in question. The controller explained that it conducted a risk assessment of MitID and identified relevant risks, including overall risks related to code quality, which JavaScript falls under. However, it stated it did not assess possible risks to the rights of the data subjects when using specifically JavaScript. Nonetheless, it clarified to have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a sufficient level of security to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Regarding this processing, the controller also clarified that many security requirements have been set to ensure that the system is secure and updated at all times. Finally, the controller noted that in 2013 it assessed the usage of JavaScript for NemID (the old eID, replaced by MitID) and found that a JavaScript solution would have always provided high security levels.","The DPA reminded that the GDPR in several provisions requires a data controller to address the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Article 25 GDPR, Article 35 GDPR and Article 36 GDPR, among others, require to consider the risks to the rights of data subjects before initiating processing operations. In addition, the DPA reminded that under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data concerned. It further noted that from both Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24(1) GDPR it follows that a controller must be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. For a supervisory authority to assess whether an adequate level of security has been ensured: the controller must document the identified risks and the mitigating measures taken.

Based on the information provided in the case, the DPA noted that the controller did not specifically assess whether the specific technology JavaScript could bring risks to the rights of the data subjects since it only carried out a risk assessment of MitID. Meanwhile, the DPA stated that the controller should have conducted a separate risk assessment of JavaScript since it was publicly known that the programming language had many issues. The DPA noted that, in this instance, this was crucial also due to the usage of JavaScript in MitID, a national infrastructure. Furthermore, the DPA found insufficient the controller’s referral to an assessment of JavaScript made several years before, the one concerning NemID.

Therefore, the DPA found that the controller did not demonstrate to have identified the risks that the use of JavaScript entails for the data subjects, nor introduced appropriate technical security measures to protect the data subjects. Thus, the DPA reprimanded the controller for processing personal data in violation of Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 24(1) GDPR and Article 32(1) GDPR.

The DPA also requested the controller to carry out a specific assessment of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects that the use of JavaScript could bring, as well as of whether appropriate measures have been taken concerning the publicly known security risks of JavaScript.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32"
"A data subject had tried to deny direct marketing carried out by a telecommunications company (the controller), but there was no direct way to do this in the direct marketing message they had received. The data subject also had difficulties finding the contact information of the data protection officer on the controller's website.

According to the controller, direct marketing could have been denied in two ways: by contacting customer service or by creating an account in the online service. The contact information of the data protection officer, on the other hand, could have been found on the controller's website, layered behind three separate pages. In addition, the data subject could have called the controller's switchboard and asked to be connected to the data protection officer.","The DPA stated that the requirement to sign in to an online service as the only possibility to deny direct marketing does not meet the requirement of ease of refusal according to Section 200(3) of the Finnish Act on Electronic Communication Services. The DPA emphasised that the requirement of Article 12(2) GDPR should also have been taken into account in order to facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights, such as the right to object according to Article 21 GDPR.

Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to ensure that data subjects are given the opportunity to easily deny the use of their contact information for direct marketing purposes in connection with electronic direct marketing messages.

With regard to the contact information of the data protection officer, the DPA considered that when the information provided to the data subject on the website is layered, for example, on different pages, the combined effect of the different pages is of paramount importance in order to ensure that the layered operating model does not increase confusion but reduces it.

Thus, the DPA instructed the controller to ensure that data subjects can easily find the contact information of the data protection officer on the controller's website in accordance with Article 12(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 21, Article 58"
"""NAV"", the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, is a government agency that collaborates with local municipalities to provide a unified access to public labor and welfare services. Its primary functions include promoting employment and ensuring financial and social security. NAV administers a significant portion of the state budget and is one of the country's largest employers with about 22,000 employees. Almost all citizens of Norway are in contact with NAV at some point of their life.

On 1 March 2023, the Norwegian DPA Datatilsynet notified NAV (the controller) of a physical inspection as per Article 57(1)(a) GDPR, Article 57(1)(h) GDPR, cf. Article 58(1)(a) GDPR, Article 58(1)(b) GDPR, Article 58(1)(e) GDPR and Article 58(1)(f) GDPR.

The DPA conducted their inspection on 6 September. They focused on the controller's IT systems for processing personal data related to their government-related services, including technical and organisational measures related to access controls, logging and log control, as per Article 32 GDPR and Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, including if the controller had established an appropriate management system in line with Article 24 GDPR and Article 5(2) GDPR.

The DPA sent the controller the preliminary audit report on 1 November, to which the controller responded on 22 November. The DPA then submitted their final report on 27 November, along with a notification of their intent to impose a fine and issue several orders.

The controller has three weeks to respond to the DPA's preliminary conclusions, after which the DPA will make their final decision.","Overall, the DPA found that many of the controller's employees work on cases from across the country, in several service areas, with broad access rights. Despite this, there isn't systematic control over how they use systems; this relies instead on trust. The employees also lack the necessary tools to manage this trust and the responsibility they're given, due to a lack of routines and supervision.

Following the audit, the DPA draws two main conclusions. First, the controller's management system is not suited to ensuring adequate security for protecting personal data. Second, confidentiality in their systems, in practice, is not adequate. This resulted in 12 violations:

* Violation 1: The controller has not established an adequate management system to provide adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that processing personal data is done in line with Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24(1) GDPR and Article 24(2) GDPR.
* Violation 2: The controller's governing documentation for access controls fails to incorporate adequate technical and organisational measures, necessary for ensuring and demonstrating compliance with Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR, see also Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24(1) GDPR and Article 24(2) GDPR.
* Violation 3: The controller does not regularly review its governing documentation for access controls, as required by Article 32(1)(d) GDPR.
* Violation 4: The controller has not implemented sufficient organisational measures to ensure that risk assessments are done as per Article 32(2) GDPR, when establishing and developing IT systems.
* Violation 5: Access to meta data of documents in one system is too general and broad, violating the confidentiality principle of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and the security requirements set out in Article 32(1) GDPR.
* Violation 6: The controller has not implemented sufficient organisational measures for training identity control administrators, violating Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(4) GDPR.
* Violation 7: The routines for granting accesses are out of date and fail to provide guidance for discretionary assessments, violating Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(4) GDPR.
* Violation 8: Access to personal data only processed for archive purposes in historical cases is too general and broad, violating the confidentiality principle of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and the security requirements set out in Article 32(1) GDPR.
* Violation 9: The controller has chosed to organise their access controls in a way that allows a significant number of users access to systems with no real work-related need for it. Combined with an inadequate system for access controls, this violates the confidentiality principle of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and the security requirements set out in Article 32(1) GDPR.
* Violation 10: The controller has inadequate technical and organisational measures for safeguarding personal data of certain categories of data subjects (own employees, people with secret addresses etc.), violating Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR.
* Violation 11: The controller has inadequate routines for controlling unit leaders' yearly revision of accesses, violating Article 32(1)(d) GDPR.
* Violation 12: The controller has not established a systematic access log control. Combined with the fact that a significant number of employees have broad accesses (see violation 9), this violates the requirement to implement sufficient technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing of personal data is done in line with the GDPR, thus violating Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR, see also Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 24(1) GDPR and Article 24(2) GDPR, as well as the requirements for periodic control as per Article 32(1)(d) GDPR.

First, the DPA intends to order the controller to rectify the 12 violations. This includes establishing a comprehensive and suitable systematic approach for organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, including necessary routines. Further, the controller must establish technical and organisational measures for access controls and access control logs to ensure confidentiality in their processing of personal data, including limiting access to what's necessary.

Second, the DPA intends to fine the controller €1,754,678 (NOK 20 million) for violating Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 32(1) GDPR, Article 32(2) GDPR, Article 32(4) GDPR, as well as Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 24(1) GDPR and Article 24(2) GDPR.

"The Icelandic DPA initiated an ex officio investigation aimed at assessing the use of Google cloud solutions and Google Workspace for education in elementary schools in five municipalities in Iceland. This summary refers to the inquiry into the use of Google’s systems in primary schools of the city of R.
On 25 February 2022, the DPA sent a questionnaire to the city of R., and carried out its assessment based on the answers and following documents produced by the city of R:
A so-called “processing file”, containing all relevant information about the data being processed in Google’s student system. Among others, almost every service included students’ names and e-mail addresses and additional information about their parents or social security numbers that can be added by the students. 
Secondly, this included a data protection impact assessment, dated 13 June 2022. In the DPIA, the city of R stated that the goal of using Google’s systems in schools was that of supporting the academic progress of students, meet their needs, allowing them to participate in school activities remotely, making project collaboration possible and others. The DPIA also clarifies that processing that falls outside the scope of the core processing activities would be omitted as far as possible. Further, it specifies that Google processes service data in the operation and management of the cloud solution including payments, settings, technical details and direct communications. With respects to data retention and deletion of personal data, the DPIA states that most data is retained for the whole school year and that teachers are encouraged to delete data. With respect to the relationship with Google, the DPIA specifies that a processing agreement was in place and it contained instructions in compliance with Article 28(3) GDPR. It could thus be concluded from the DPIA that the City of R had taken adequate measures to mitigate the risks to rights and freedoms of primary school students. The DPIA was then updated in September 2022, addressing also risks related to the transfer of personal data to third countries.
Thirdly, the City of R attached the data processing agreement among the documents. The agreement between the city of R and Google stipulated that the city of R is the controller and Google the processor. In some instances, however, the city could also be the processor and Google the sub-processor, when ….
The agreement also states that the controller instructs the processor on the processing of personal data, but this is limited to certain cases. Further, it contains provisions on the security of processing, transfers of personal data and other obligations. 
Google’s terms specify the information that google is provided with by the controller and information that google collects itself, either information that is added by users or device, log and location information based on the use of its services. They also state that google processes users’ information collected when using its services only to provide those services and this is processed in accordance with Google’s privacy policy. 
Google’s privacy policy differentiates between customer data and service data: customer data relates to information that the City of Reykjavík or the users of Google’s student system transmit to Google through the system and it is covered by the processing agreement; whereas service data is data collected or generated by google during the provision and administration of its cloud services, which is processed in accordance with its privacy policy. 
Lastly, in its comments, the City of R submitted that the systems are used approximately by 8.500 students and it claimed that it has done everything it could in order to ensure compliance with the GDPR. 
After requests to provide further information and an exchange of comments, the DPA issued a report detailing the results of its assessment. After hearing explanations and viewpoints of the city of R on the DPA’s assessment, the DPA published its final decision.","On the basis of all the above, the DPA first of all clarified that it considers customer data, including data that relates to projects, tests, and any other data registered by the students should always be considered personal data under the GDPR if it can be linked to specific students and that the same applies to service data which can be linked to them. 
As a preliminary observation, the DPA stressed the fact that it is of utmost importance to ensure that personal data of children in an educational context is processed in accordance with the GDPR, in particular with the principles of proportionality and data minimization. Also, the DPA held, this implies that the purpose of processing of such personal data must be defined narrowly.  
Firstly, as regards the liability of processing, the DPA found that since the city of R decided to make use of Google systems in elementary schools, it should be considered a controller under the GDPR. However, in light of the comments and explanations provided by the city of R, the DPA agrees that R cannot be considered a controller with respect to the processing of service data by Google, as it is Google that determines the purposes and scope of processing and is a controller in that case. Still, the DPA considered that because it is the Municipality of R that decided to make use of Google’s services, this does not release completely the municipality from its responsibility. As a matter of fact, controllers are responsible for ensuring that processing activities always comply with the principles of processing of Article 5 GDPR and it is responsible for taking the appropriate measures to ensure this under Article 24 GDPR. Further, when someone is entrusted with processing on behalf of the controller, it is the controller who is obliged to only choose processors that provide sufficient guarantees for the processing, as per Article 28(1) GDPR. The DPA clarified, making reference to EDPB Guidelines 7/2020, that when entrusting processing to a service provider, the controller “should carefully assess whether the service provider enables it to fulfill its responsibility in an adequate manner, with respect to the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and taking into account possible risks associated with the processing for the registered.” Further, the controller should be responsible for stipulating adequate processing agreements and to ensure that the principle of purpose limitation is ensured. 
Hence, the DPA found that when a service provider uses personal data to which it has gained access on the basis of a processing agreement with a controller and uses such data for its own purposes, it should be considered a controller, but such processing should also be considered in violation of the GDPR. In conclusion, the DPA held that the city of R should have ensured that the personal data would only be processed for the purposes specified by it. Since the processing of service data was not included in the processing agreement, thus the city of R could not assess the necessity of such processing, the city of R failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 5(1) GDPR, Article 24(1) GDPR and Article 28(1) GDPR.
Secondly, the DPA found that, since the data processing agreement did not preclude Google from further processing of personal data the agreement is to be considered in violation of article 28(3)(a) GDPR. 
Thirdly, as regards the lawfulness of processing, the city of R claims that the processing of personal data of students via Google systems is necessary for performance of a task in the public interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The DPA held that in this case the personal data being processed must be necessary for a specific purpose and must reflect the principle of proportionality, taking also into account the fact that personal data of children deserves special protection. With regard to customer data, the DPA concluded that the personal data of students is processed for specified purposes and may be considered necessary for the school to carry out its task in the public interest. However, as regards the processing of service data by google, the DPA reiterated the obligation of the controller to make sure that the students’ data is not used for purposes other than those specified for the processing, as per Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. Since Google’s privacy policy specifies that google may use service data for further purposes and that the city of R failed to take a position on such processing, the city of R acted in violation of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR and Article 6(4) GDPR.
Fourth, as regards the requirements of privacy by design and by default, the DPA concluded that the City of R failed to adopt the necessary organizational measures to enforce such principles.  complied with such requirements. Also, with respect to the principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR, the DPA found that the city of R retains data in respect of this principle but it is not clear from Google’s privacy policy for cloud services how long it stores personal data. The DPA thus held that it is the responsibility of the City of R to obtain relevant information about this and take a position in this regard. 
Fifth, the DPA held that the DPIA carried out by the City of R could not be considered complete as it did not include all minimum requirements of Article 35(7) GDPR. In particular it failed to include the processing operations on service data by Google in the description of processing under point (a); it failed to assess the necessity of processing under point (b) and it also did not adequately assess the risks to rights and freedoms of individuals under point (c). 
Lastly, the DPA held that the controller also failed to ensure a safe transfer of personal data to the US and thus violated Article 44 GDPR. 
In light of all this, the DPA first ordered the City of R to bring its processing operations into compliance with the GDPR under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR. In addition to this, given the entity, nature and gravity of the infringements, the fact that they relate to personal data of children and may potentially include sensitive personal data, the DPA imposed an administrative fine in the amount of 2,000,000 ISK on the controller under Article 83(2)(a) GDPR and Article 83(2)(g) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 35, Article 44, Article 58, Article 83"

"Following a general check carried out by the DPA on all Luxembourgish municipalities in the summer of 2022, at a meeting on 9 December 2022, the Luxembourgish DPA decided to open an investigation on the Municipal Administration of Leudelange (the controller) to assess its compliance with the GDPR.

Specifically, the controller aimed to evaluate the controller’s conformity with its obligation to appoint a DPO and whether it communicated the DPO's contact details to the DPA, as provided by Articles 37(1)(a) GDPR and Article 37(7) GDPR. 

At the end of the investigation, the appointed head of the investigation flagged to the DPA a breach of Article 37 GDPR. Thus, on 4 July 2023, the DPA held a meeting with both the head of the investigation and the controller.","The DPA noted that pursuant to the entry into force of the GDPR, public bodies were obliged to designate a DPO no later than 25 May 2018. Meanwhile, on the date the investigation was opened, and after consulting the register of DPOs, no DPO had been identified for the controller. It was also acknowledged that the controller appointed a DPO only on 10 March 2023, after the opening of the investigation. Thus, the DPA found undisputable that on the date the investigation was opened, on 9 December 2022, the controller had not yet appointed a DPO. Thus, the controller violated Article 37(1)(a) GDPR.

"The Belgian DPA started an investigation into the usage of a tool called 'MeldJeAan' by the city of Antwerp.

The tool in question could be used by parents to claim a spot for their children in a school. To use the tool, specific personal data had to be provided, such as contact details, personal details of the child, and information on the parents. By logging in, schools could download the list of all the information of their students. However, due to a flaw in the system, the lists could be accessed directly without logging in. It had been noted that there had been a data breach as there was at least one confirmed download by an unauthorised party through this way.

Following the investigation, a report was produced, which  flagged several breaches by the city of Antwerp. On 23 June 2023, the DPA held a hearing on the matter.","The DPA started by assessing the role of the city of Antwerp in the situation at hand. Since the purposes of the tool were decided by several parties, including the city of Antwerp, and Antwerp partly financed the usage of the tool, the DPA concluded that there was joint-controllership according to Article 26 GDPR.

The DPA noted that a controller has an obligation to take measures to ensure an appropriate level of security and compliance with the GDPR, as well as demonstrate the measures taken, according to Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 24(1) GDPR and Article 25(1) GDPR. In light of this, the DPA stated that the city of Antwerp did not provide any documentation showcasing compliance and regarding measures and decisions that were taken for the security of the processing of personal data, breaching the above-mentioned articles. Furthermore, after reviewing the documentation produced regarding the data breach, the DPA found the documentation abstract and lacking in follow-up planning, as well as non-compliant with Articles 32(1) and 32(2) GDPR.

The DPA also identified a breach of Article 35(1), Article 35(2), Article 35(3) and Article 35(7) GDPR since, even though the tool predated the GDPR, the city of Antwerp should have proactively assessed if the processing aligned with the GDPR and adapted their processing if necessary, including conducting a correct DPIA. Meanwhile, the DPA noted that in the DPIA provided to it by the city of Antwerp, the latter was wrongfully designated as a processor.

Lastly, the DPA found that although the DPO was involved in the data breach, it was not involved in a timely manner to ensure adequate security of processing according to Article 32(1) GDPR. The DPA stated that as soon as the city of Antwerp became a joint-controller, the DPO should have become involved, not only after the data breach was discovered. As such, the DPA found a breach of Article 38(1) GDPR and Article 39(1) GDPR.

"On 14 March 2023, the DPA had notified the controller (Lääkärikeskus Gyneko Oy, a healthcare provider) of its previous decision regarding electronic healthcare appointment booking systems. At the same time, the controller had been asked to explain how its online appointment booking system works.

According to the controller, a person had to provide their name and personal identity code in order to book an appointment online. No abuse of the system had been detected and efforts had been made to detect it by monitoring the number of logins and failed login attempts. It would also have been possible to set a password for the system, but the controller had not implemented such an arrangement.","The DPA pointed out that only requesting a name and personal identity code when booking an appointment online does not verify the person's identity. The personal identity code is not intended to be used as a means of identification, like a password, but to distinguish one person from another.

The DPA considered that the controller's appointment booking system enabled an unknown third party to book an appointment if they knew the name and personal identity code of the data subject. Such misuse may cause a variety of damage to the data subject in the form of false invoices or identity theft. The DPA also emphasised that healthcare appointment information is data concerning health according to Article 9(1) GDPR and must be protected with particular care.

The DPA held that the security level of personal data processing carried out by the controller could not be considered appropriate in accordance with Article 31(1)(b) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR.

Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to identify the data subject in a reliable way, such as by implementing a password or switching to electronic identification in the appointment booking system.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 32, Article 58"
"The Finnish DPA had asked the controller (Kesko Oyj, Finland's largest retail chain) to explain how it processed and stored personal data in connection with its loyalty program.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it processed basic customer information, such as the person's name and contact information, and purchasing behaviour data. Purchasing behaviour data indicates customers' detailed and product-specific purchase data. Depending on the situation, the information related to the customer was erased at the end of the customer relationship or anonymised no later than 25 months after the end of the customer relationship.

The controller also stated that it processes purchase data for business development, the provision of benefits and services, and the implementation and targeting of marketing. The controller emphasised that unjustifiably prohibiting or restricting the collection and processing of data that benefits the customer would undermine data-driven innovations and product development.","The DPA stated that tying the storage period of purchase data to the duration of the customer relationship had resulted in the data being stored in a form that enables identification of the data subject for potentially very long periods, even decades. A storage period based on the duration of the customer relationship could therefore lead to very long storage of the purchase data, even for the lifetime of the data subject.

Moreover, according to the DPA, some of the purchase data could be used to infer detailed information about the person's life situation, lifestyle and movements. Purchase data may also indirectly reveal personal data belonging to the special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR. For example, customers had the opportunity to collect loyalty points by using certain healthcare services. The risk associated with the processing of such data increases the more extensive data is collected and the longer it is stored.

Hence, the DPA considered that the controller should have defined the storage period for purchase data on a purpose-specific basis and assessed it separately from the storage period of other personal data needed to manage the customer relationship. The controller should have determined the storage period for purchase data already before engaging in any personal data processing activities since data subjects must be informed of the storage period when collecting personal data in accordance with Article 13(2)(a) GDPR.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 5(1)(e) GDPR, Article 25(1) GDPR and Article 25(2) GDPR, as the storage period of purchase data tied to the duration of the customer relationship was not necessary for the purposes for which the controller processed the personal data. Furthermore, the DPA stressed that in compliance with data protection by default, the controller should have ensured that a data subject would have the opportunity to influence the level of collection of their personal data from the beginning, for example, by choosing in the registration form the level of data collection they want.

As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR. Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA also ordered the controller to define a storage period for purchase data according to the purpose of use and to erase or anonymise purchase data older than the defined storage period.

In addition to the reprimand and the order, the Sanctions Board of the DPA assessed the necessity of imposing an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 GDPR. The Board concluded that several factors would have justified the imposition of a fine. The infringement concerned 3.49 million data subjects, and the amount of data collected for each data subject had been significant. However, the Sanctions Board considered that tying the storage period of purchase data to the duration of the customer relationship had not yet led to such long storage periods to the extent that an administrative fine should be imposed.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 13, Article 25, Article 58, Article 83"
"The data subject is a former customer (tenant) of the controller (Gavanova de immobles, S.L.).

On 29 July 2020 the data subject signed the reservation document for the property, then on 4 September 2020 the lease agreement / contract was signed. After approximately two years the lease was terminated on 31 January 2022.

On 30 June 2022 the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) received a complaint from the data subject stating, that they didn’t feel that their data was protected by the controller. The data subject suspected that their personal data had been used to enter into a contract with a third party (a cleaning company) without their knowledge. When the data subject went on the real estate´s website, the Privacy Policy page was blank. The data subject also found out that the contract and lease resolution made between the two parties, contained data protection law which was not up to date with the current law.

Following the complaint lodged by the data subject, the Spanish DPA accessed the website of the controller on 27 July 2022 and confirmed that the Privacy Policy section was in fact blank. As a result, the DPA asked the controller to explain themselves. The reason for that step was, that the controller could proceed with the analysis and inform the DPA within one month of actions carried out to adapt to the requirements set out in the data protection regulations. This was carried out in accordance with Spanish Public Administration Law (Common Administrative Procedure for Public Administrations) by electronic means. However, the controller did not take up the required steps and it was understood to have rejected them. Nevertheless, a copy was sent via post which was notified on 31 August 2022. In this notification, the controller was reminded to interact electronically and that from now on they would be notified exclusively by electronic means. The controller did not reply.

On 20 September 2022 the complaint was admitted for processing.

Shortly after, the Spanish DPA accessed the website again to check if any changes have been made. The DPA proved that the Private Policy page was last updated on 29 September 2022.

As a result, the director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the controller for the infringement of Article 13 GDPR as defined in Article 83(5)(b) GDPR. This initiation agreement was notified and delivered to the controller on 16 December 2022.

The controller responded with a written statement in due time and form on the 21 December 2022. The controller mentioned that the data subject had authorised them to process their data including the possible transfer to other companies (in this case a cleaning company). The data subject had agreed with the landlady that the cleaning of the flat would be deducted from their deposit.

Therefore, the controller argued that the complainant authorised them to process their data. Moreover, there was no significant proof of any exchange of data between the controller and the cleaning company. In addition, the controller information given to the complainant was only out of date and since then has been updated the Privacy Policy and Legal Notice have been modified. -The controller even invoked the mitigating factor that they complied with the DPA and with the procedure. They contacted a consultancy firm to advise them on compliance with the rules.  They noted that no benefits have been claimed from the commission of the offence and no rights of minors have been harmed.

On the 31 January 2023 the DPA agreed to open a period of evidence. The complaint by the data subject and the controller´s allegations to the initiation agreement and the accompanying documentation were already incorporated. The controller was required to provide a copy of the new contract they make with tenants, landlords and third-party companies.

Subsequently on 13 February 2023 the controller replied by sending the requested documents called “Lease contract” and “Termination of contract” with an annex “Information on Personal Data Protection”.","As a response to the allegations made by the controller, the DPA pointed out that the cooperation has been considered, when setting the fine imposed according to Article 83(2) GDPR. However, the DPA also stressed, the principle of accountability according to Article 5(2) GDPR.

Relating to the measures adopted the DPA said that the website lacked the following mandatory sections: purpose, legitimisation, or period of conservation of personal data.

In addition, the DPA wanted to point out that the adoption of the measures by the controller did not remedy the infringement of Article 13 GDPR. After all, the controller did not comply with their obligation to correctly inform the data subject, prior to the initiation of the sanctioning procedure.

The claims of the controller were dismissed by the DPA. In addition, the processing of data had to be according to Article 5 GDPR and Recital 60.

Regarding the Privacy Policy however, it was clear that it didn’t inform users of all the points listed in Article 13 GDPR.

Due to the known facts the DPA attributed the infringement to the controller for violation of Article 13 GDPR.

After balancing the circumstances, the DPA has concluded that a fine of €2,000 be set for the infringement of Article 13 GDPR as defined in Article 83(5) GDPR. Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR the Spanish DPA ordered the controller to accredit that it has completed the information contained in the section Privacy Policy on their website within ten working days of being notified.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 58, Article 83"
"In 2019, the Finnish DPA had asked a healthcare provider (the controller) to explain how its online appointment booking system worked.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that a user had to log in to the booking system with their name and personal identity code. The system had compared the information provided by the user against the information stored in the controller's patient information system. The user had been instructed to check the login information if it did not match the information in the patient information system.

The controller acknowledged that, under certain conditions, the online appointment booking service could have been used to determine the complete personal identity of a data subject code by using brute force technique. The controller considered that this could have been prevented by limiting the retries of incorrectly entered login information.

The controller also stated that it was able to investigate possible misuse by examining the log data collected from the service. The controller was aware that the personal identity code may often be known to people other than the data subject. However, the controller had assessed the overall risks to be low or moderate in terms of likelihood and severity.

In 2020, the controller had submitted a data breach notification to the DPA, according to which the controller's online appointment booking system had been targeted by phishing. The phishing had come to light as a result of a blackmail message received by the controller, which revealed that a third party had obtained personal identity codes through the system. Following the breach, the controller had switched to strong electronic identification in its system.","The DPA stated that the controller had failed to ensure the continuous confidentiality of the online appointment booking system. It had been possible to use the system to determine the complete personal identity code and a third party had also gained access to personal identity codes as a result of a data breach. The vulnerability of the system could have been remedied on the basis on the explanation provided by the controller.

The DPA considered that the personal identity code is not information belonging to the special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9(1) GDPR. However, the personal identity codes that have come into the possession of a third party can be widely disseminated and repeatedly misused, for example for fraud and harassment purposes. Such misuse may cause both material and non-material damage to the data subjects. The amount of damage may be increased by the fact that it may take time to detect a data breach, leaving data subjects unable to protect themselves from the misuse as soon as the breach occurs.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller and the level of security of personal data processing could not be considered appropriate in accordance with Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR regarding the online appointment booking system. As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 32, Article 58"
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a healthcare provider (the controller) charged a fee for handing over copies of magnetic resonance images (MRI) when data subjects requested access to their personal data in accordance with Article 15 GDPR.

The DPA had asked the controller to explain how it facilitated the exercise of data subject rights under Article 15 GDPR in situations where a data subject would request their MRIs without explicitly referring to their right under the GDPR.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it provided the MRIs free of charge when a patient made an access request in accordance with Article 15 GDPR. The controller also stated that it provided patients with medical records once a year free of charge when they invoked the right of access under the GDPR. However, the controller considered that when a patient requested a recording of their MRI examination directly from the MRI scanning, the right of access was not invoked, and the recording was chargeable.

The controller also stated that in its price list, it was mentioned that the provision of material related to the right of access would be free of charge if the request was made using an access request form or from the controller's registry office and that in other cases, a fee was charged for the request. It added that when the patient requested access to their personal data, the controller did not separately ask whether it was a request regarding the right of access under the GDPR.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA stated that data subjects do not need to know how to invoke a specific provision of the GDPR in order to obtain their personal data free of charge under the right of access. Instead, the controller has an obligation to facilitate the exercise of the right of access and to inform the data subjects of the possibility of obtaining a copy of their personal data free of charge pursuant to Article 15 GDPR.

The DPA considered that the data subject cannot, therefore, be required to familiarise themselves with, for example, the price list in order to be able to submit an access request. Also, by default, the controller may not charge a fee for the provision of MRIs to the data subject directly from the MRI scanning.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 12(2) GDPR by not facilitating the exercise of the right of access under Article 15 GDPR. As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR. Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA also ordered the controller to bring its processing operations into compliance with the aforementioned provisions of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 58"
"The CNIL commenced an investigation into the data controller to verify compliance with the GDPR, including an online check of the website www.new.neosurf.com and an on-the-spot check of the data controller’s premises. The data controller was an electronic money distributor that facilitates online payments. The rapporteur undertaking these investigations found that when creating a user account on the www.neosurf.com website, the surname, first name, date of birth, postal address, email address, telephone number and, if applicable, bank details were collected, as well as personal documents, such as proof of identity and residence. While the data controller specified a retention period of ten years of this data from the last transaction carried out on the account, in fact, no purge had been carried out in the databases since the beginning of its activity in 2005. An estimated 70,049 accounts had been inactive for more than ten years, but not deleted or anonymised. Additionally, 51,735 accounts were kept for no purpose, insofar as they were ""unconfirmed"", i.e. the email address had not been confirmed when the account was created.

Furthermore, the information provided by the company on the website www.neosurf.com and on its mobile application via the privacy policy was incomplete, not up-to-date and only in English.

The data controller also allowed users to create account passwords comprised of six-characters or more, composed of three categories of characters (uppercase, lowercase and numbers) and that no access restrictions in the event of authentication failure were implemented. 49,214 passwords were entered in clear text in the company's database and associated with their email address and identifier.

Additionally, thirteen cookies were deposited before any action, including consent, could be taken by the user upon arrival on the home page of the website www.neosurf.com. The Google reCaptcha module, to block robots on the registration and connection page to the neosurf website and mobile application, was also used without asking for user consent.

The data controller argued that the proposed administrative fine was disproportionate to the alleged breaches and its conduct since it had implemented several corrective measures, in particular, the effective application of its policy on the retention of user account data, the implementation of a password policy with an adequate level of security, the use of a state-of-the-art password hashing algorithm and the collection of consent to the deposit of cookies and tracers when required.","Article 5(1)(e) GDPR:

Recalling the CNIL decision of 8 September 2022, No. SAN-2022-018 the CNIL noted that the retention period of personal data must be determined according to the purpose pursued by the processing. When they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected, the data must either be deleted or subject to intermediate archiving when their retention is necessary for compliance with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or contentious purposes. Beyond these retention periods in intermediate archive, personal data must, with some exceptions, be deleted or anonymized.

Since the 51,735 ‘unconfirmed’ accounts were subject to a retention policy of 1 year before deletion, the data controller was not in breach of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. However, the data controller had breached this article in respect of the 70,049 inactive accounts as no deletion or anonymisation had occurred following the end of the 10 year retention period. Rather, the accounts had been kept for an indefinite period.

Articles 12 and 13 GDPR:

Since the information on data processing was provided by means of a privacy policy only in English, despite targeting a French-speaking public, data subjects were not able to assess in advance the scope and consequences of the processing. The data controller therefore was not complying with the transparency requirements of information set by Article 12 GDPR.

Furthermore, the privacy policy did not mention the data retention period or the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL. Given the information being processed, including bank details, this information was necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing within the meaning of Article 13(2) GDPR. The coexistence of incomplete versions of the privacy policy was also likely to create confusion among data subjects as to their data protection rights. These findings were also applicable to the mobile application.

[[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]]

The controller is required to ensure that the automated data processing he implements is sufficiently secure. The sufficiency of the security measures is assessed, on the one hand, with regard to the characteristics of the processing and the risks it entails, on the other hand, taking into account the state of knowledge and the cost of the measures. The data controller’s password rules were considered too permissive, leading to insufficiently robust passwords susceptible to brute force attacks and thereby could not provide for the security of the data processed. Nor did the clear storage of users' passwords, associated with their identifiers and email address, guarantee the security and confidentiality of personal data. Together with the use of an outdated hashing system by was of further password protection, the data controller had breached Article 32 GDPR. However, while there was initial concern of a further breach by too many people being able to access the customer database, the data controller was able to prove that access was restricted to only two people. In this instance, Article 32 GDPR was not breached.

Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act:

Regarding placing cookies without user consent, the data controller argued that the Google Analytics cookie was an audience measurement tool for internal use exempt from the collection of consent. However, Article 82 Data Protection Act provides that operations to access or register information in a user's terminal can only take place after the latter has expressed his consent, only cookies whose exclusive purpose is to allow or facilitate communication by electronic means or those strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user being exempt from this obligation. After considering the available Google documentation, the CNIL held that the deposit of these cookies is subject to the prior collection of the user's consent, since they do not have the exclusive purpose of allowing or facilitating communication by electronic means and are also not strictly necessary for the provision of a service expressly requested by the user. By failing to grant users a choice regarding the deposit of tracers, together with a choice about using Google ReCaptch, the data controller had breached Article 82. Additionally, the data controller was not justified in arguing that it would be unfair to impose on GOOGLE's customers, of which it is a part, breaches of Article 82 Data Protection Act, by citing the lack of transparency and accessibility of GOOGLE's contractual conditions.

Fines:

The CNIL issued a fine of €90,000 for breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 12, 13 and 32 GDPR, and an additional €15,000 for the data controller’s breach of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act. Factors which informed the fines included: - the fundamental nature of the GDPR principles breached, which concerned over 700,000 people; - the negligence of the data controller in deactivating accounts in stead of deleting or anonymising the data; - the failure to meet the requirement to provide complete and transparent information to data subjects, as an essential prerequisite for this type of processing of personal data; - the number of breaches found with the basic security obligations, namely, the use of an insufficiently robust password for user accounts containing for some bank details and the hashing of passwords by means of an obsolete function; and - the significant number of people not asked for consent concerning cookie acceptance.

While the CNIL took into account the data controller’s new measures following the notification of the sanction report, these actions do not exempt it from its responsibility for past breaches.

Given the seriousness of the breaches and the number of persons affected, the CNIL did not agree with the data controller’s arguments that the decision be kept confidential due to the need to protect business secrets (which are kept confidential by the CNIL in any event).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32"
"The Finnish DPA had asked the controller (OP-Henkivakuutus Oy, a life insurance company) to explain on which legal basis and for what purpose it processed data subjects' health data requested from the health care. The controller was also asked to explain how it processed personal data before the execution of an insurance contract.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the processing was based on Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, according to which insurance institutions may, despite the general prohibition in Article 9(1) GDPR, process the health data of the insured party and the claimant, which is necessary to determine the liability of the insurance institution. The controller considered that it had the right to process health data at all stages of the life insurance customer relationship: when applying for insurance, during the insurance period and after an insured event has occurred.

The controller also stated that it requested all data subjects applying for life insurance for their consent to that the controller may, if necessary, request health data from health care units in order to process the insurance application and possible compensation case, and to ensure the accuracy of the health data. The controller considered it necessary that the consent given by data subjects was valid for the entire duration of the insurance contract.

The controller claimed that a situation where the data subject withdraws their consent or does not give it in the first place, but the controller must still issue life insurance and keep it valid, is impossible. In the controller's view, the data subject could have terminated the insurance at any time if they did not want the controller to receive their health data from the health care.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA emphasised that Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, which is based on Article 9(2)(g) GDPR, applies only to the processing of the personal data of insured parties and claimants. The DPA considered that the insurance contract has not yet been concluded at the insurance application stage, and the provisions of the Finnish Data Protection Act cannot be extended to a data subject applying for insurance. Therefore, Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act cannot be applied to the processing of health data of insurance applicants and to requesting their health data from health care units.

The DPA stated that the consent requested by the controller concerned an unspecified set of health data stored in the patient information systems of various health care units. The data subjects could not control whether their personal data was processed or not or for what purposes it was processed. Thus, the consent requested by the controller was not sufficient to fulfil the requirements for the processing of special categories of personal data according to Article 9(2)(a) GDPR.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 9 GDPR. As a result, and in accordance with Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to bring its processing operations into compliance with the provisions of Article 9 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 58"
"Following a series of reports and complaints against ICS, a subsidiary of ABN AMRO, as a controller, the Dutch DPA (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, AP) decided to start an ex officio investigation into the processing operations carried out by the controller. The AP mainly received complaints concerning the controller's process of re-identifying its customers online by means of a new identification and verification tool, ID&V. The AP found that the controller never conducted a DPIA in 2018, prior to the introduction of its identification system, and asked the controller to provide its submissions on this.

The controller claimed in this respect that it did not need to carry out a DPIA, since the same identification system was used by ABN AMRO before, and ABN AMRO had previously carried out a risk assessment of its own authentication app. Moreover, the controller argued that when ID&V was introduced, there were no risks of potential misuse of personal data, and strict security measures were in place. Also, the controller argued that the only criterion that suggested the need to carry out a DPIA, according to Article 35 GDPR, was the fact that the processing was large-scale, but no other criteria were given that would make its processing activities ""high risk"". Lastly, the controller claimed that it does not process any special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR.","The AP first of all assessed whether the controller’s processing operations presented a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The AP made this assessment in light of Article 29 Working Party Guidelines 248 rev.01 on “Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is ‘likely to result in a high risk’ for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679” and Article 35 GDPR and it stated that in order for processing operations to be considered “high risk”, at least two of the criteria set out in Article 35(3) GDPR must be met. In the case at hand, the AP considered that the processing operations carried out by the controller meet two of these criteria, namely, processing of sensitive data and large-scale processing. As a matter of fact, the controller processes several data about its customers, including ID number and photograph and the controller has around 1,5 million customers, who have all been required to re-identify using ID&V.

In light of this, the AP considered that the controller should have carried out a DPIA. With respect to the claim of the controller that its parent company, ABN AMRO, already assessed the risk of its authentication app and this exempted the controller to carry out its own DPIA, the AP again referred to the Article 29 WP Guidelines. The Guidelines foresee that a DPIA needs to comply with the minimum requirements of Article 35(7) GDPR. The AP evaluated the assessment carried out by ABN AMRO and found that it mainly concerned risks related to fraud and money laundering and only three data protection related risks were included. However, the assessment did not contain any description of processing, nor a proportionality and necessity assessment, nor did it refer to the measures adopted to address the risks. Hence, the AP concluded that the controller’s evaluation of data protection risks in conjunction with ABN AMRO’s assessment cannot be considered to be equivalent to a DPIA under Article 35 GDPR. For this reason, the AP held that the controller violated Article 35(1) GDPR.

In this, the AP considered it appropriate to impose a fine on the controller, in accordance with Article 83 GDPR. The AP made reference to the National Fine Policy of 2019 and to EDPB Guidelines 04/22 when calculating the amount of the fine to be imposed. In its considerations, the AP gave importance to the fact that not conducting a DPIA constitutes a GDPR violation in itself, but it also increases the likelihood of further GDPR violations, as there is no understanding of the risks. Last, taking into account the annual global turnover of the whole ABN AMRO group, the AP decided to impose a fine in the amount of €150,000 on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 35
"On 2 June 2021, the French DPA (“CNIL”) informed a French municipality (“the controller”)  that they had not named a DPO. The municipality did not respond, therefore on 25 April 2022, the CNIL gave formal notice to the municipality to designate a DPO within four months of this notice. The controller neither replied to the DPA, nor complied with its requests.

This article applies to the municipality and the DPA reiterated the importance of a DPO in order to ensure compliance with said article, especially within public authorities who process large amounts of personal data, some of which is sensitive data. The CNIL found that the municipality did not designate a DPO and therefore failed to comply with Article 37(1)(a) GDPR.

Secondly, Article 31 GDPR states that the controller should cooperate within the DPA in the performance of its tasks. The CNIL noted that the municipality did not respond to the different letters, formal notices and decisions addressed to it by the DPA, thus failing to comply with Article 31 GDPR.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it processed data subjects' health data for the performance of an insurance contract in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. In addition, the processing was based on Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, according to which insurance institutions may, despite the general prohibition in Article 9(1) GDPR, process the health data of the insured party and the claimant, which is necessary to determine the liability of the insurance institution.

The controller stated that it requested all data subjects applying for life insurance for their consent to that the controller may, if necessary, request health data from health care units in order to determine the scope of the insurance coverage and the amount of the insurance premium, as well as whether the insurance can be granted.

The controller also stated that it only requested health data necessary for the execution of the insurance contract. The necessity of the health data depends on the insurance product and is generally requested for the five years preceding the insurance application.

The DPA considered that it was against the principles of fairness, data minimisation and data protection by default that the controller requested health care units to disclose all the health data concerning the data subject. Therefore, the controller must be able to demonstrate that it only requests such health data that is necessary for determining its liability.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, Article 9 GDPR and Article 25(2) GDPR. As a result, and in accordance with Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to assess the time period for which it is necessary to request health data and to bring its processing operations into compliance with the provisions of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 25, Article 58"
"In November 2019, the French DPA (""CNIL"") carried out inspections on the premises of Amazon France Logistique (“controller”) to apprehend the processing of employee's personal data via scanners and video surveillance.

The CNIL discovered that when an employee was assigned to a direct task, they were equipped with a scanner, enabling them to identify themselves, receive instructions, scan labels of the items they were processing etc. This allowed the controller to continuously collect data relating to the activity of employees assigned to direct tasks making it possible to measure the employee’s activity, in particular by counting the number of units they process over a given period.

Inactivity indicators were reported in real time for each employee. One of the indicators named Stow Gun Machine allowed the controller to monitor each gesture performed by the employee in each direct task assigned to them, by associating with it an error indicator each time their speed was less than 1,25 seconds. These indicators were stored for 31 days and could be consulted both via raw data and in the form of statistics. Weekly performance reports were drawn up for each employee on the basis of the indicators collected, and contained weekly, daily and hourly statistics on compliance with quality procedures and productivity.

Following the on-site inspections, numerous exchanges took place between the CNIL and the controller, from November 2019 to January 2021. The CNIL started a sanctioning procedure against the controller on 28 January 2021.","Preliminarily, the CNIL established that Amazon France Logistique was the controller under Article 4(7) GDPR. The DPA considered that the determination of processing was linked to Amazon’s French human resources management. Although the employee management process is based on a common framework for the entities of Amazon group, they are subject to local adaptations decided autonomously by the local branches of the controller.  The CNIL considered that Amazon France Logistique was free to adapt the criteria developed at a group level to assess the performance of employees working and to install video surveillance cameras in its warehouses and was therefore the controller.

The processing was not cross-border meaning that the French DPA did not have to invoke Article 60 GDPR and were competent to decide the decision on their own. The French DPA considered themselves competent because (i) the processing of employees’ personal data was carried out in the context of the activities of the activities of the controller, which has its registered office in France and (ii) the processing in question was carried out in the context of the controller's activities and it affects or is likely to affect only employees working in the company's warehouses located in France.

Firstly, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR establishes that processing is lawful if it is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The CNIL noted that given the nature of the processing in question the legal bases provided by Article 6(1)(a) to (e) GDPR could not apply. Consent could not apply in this case because of the imbalance in the employer-employee relationship. Therefore, the DPA indicated that the data processing could only be based on legitimate interest, as long as it did not disproportionately affect the rights, freedoms and interests of employees.

The CNIL noted that the Stow Gun Machine indicator processing was likely to have moral repercussions on the employees and the inactivity indicators were linked to the identity of each employee which, in practice, forced employees to be able to justify any time considered to be non-productive. The DPA considered that these measures were highly intrusive and therefore could not be based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

Secondly, Article 5(1)(c) GDPR indicates that personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary regarding the purposes (data minimisation). The CNIL also noted that the processing failed to comply with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR regarding the processing of quality and productivity indicators for the purposes of reassigning and coaching employees in real time, the processing carried out for week planning purposes and the processing for the purpose of employee assessments.  The CNIL considered that keeping and accessing all this raw data used for these purposes was not necessary.

Thirdly, the controller had violated the informational requirements contained in Article 12 GDPR and Article 13 GDPR. The CNIL noted that until April 2020, temporary workers were not given the privacy policy applicable in human resources, nor were they invited to familiarize themselves with it on the intranet. The DPA considered that putting the information regarding processing on the intranet for employees working in warehouses who were not intended to work on an office computer did not constitute a satisfactory means of information.

Fourthly, the CNIL considered that the data controller failed to comply with Article 13 GDPR regarding video surveillance since the controller did not provide an indication of how long the data would be kept, the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL and the contact details of the DPO.

Furthermore, Article 32 GDPR states that the controller must ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Regarding video surveillance, the CNIL considered that the lack of access traceability due to the use of a shared account complicated investigation work in the event of a fraudulent access, deterioration or deletion of images. The DPA added that the password for accessing the video surveillance software was insufficiently robust and could lead to attacks by unauthorized parties. The CNIL also noted that the authentication of authorized persons to an individual Windows account prior to their connection to the video surveillance software was not sufficient to compensate for the vulnerabilities resulting from the access to the software from a shared account and using an insufficiently robust password. Consequently, the CNIL considered these facts to constitute a breach of Article 32 GDPR.

In view of all the violations, the CNIL decided to impose an administrative fine of €32 million.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32"
"AULA is Denmark's school communication platform. AULA therefore, processes personal data, including confidential and sensitive personal data, about vulnerable data subjects, including children. The users of the system are often persons who do not work primarily with data protection (including teachers, staff as well as pupils and parents) and so high security measures under Article 32 GDPR and Article 25 GDPR are required.

The Danish DPA observed a number of personal data breaches in connection with the processing of personal data in AULA within Danish municipalities. A large proportion of the notifications of personal data breaches in AULA concern personal data being sent to one or more incorrect recipients in AULA. For example, where a message or secure file about a child has been sent to another child's parents, or where a message has been sent by mistake to a group of recipients instead of a specific recipient.

The DPA therefore, decided to conducted inspections into the processing of data in the AULA IT system across six municipalities. The investigations focused on the security of technical and organisational measures.

The DPA decided to inspect these municipalities collectively. Since all muncipalites used the same IT systems the same general data protection law issues would arise. The investigation included Esbjerg Municipality, Frederikshavn Municipality, Hillerød Municipality, Copenhagen Municipality, Lolland Municipality and Randers Municipality, which were selected with the aim of gaining a broad and representative insight into the municipalities' considerations in relation to the security of processing when using AULA.

The Danish DPA decided in five of the six cases. The investigation case with the City of Copenhagen contained some additional elements, which is why the Danish DPA has not yet made a decision in this case. Overall. the inspections revealed concerns about personal data breaches, especially regarding the inadvertent transmission of sensitive information to unintended recipients within AULA.","The Danish DPA reprimanded all five municipalities for failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures under Article 32 GDPR and failing to mitigate risks under Article 25 GDPR.

The municipalities handled the task of documenting their assessments of the security of processing in different ways. Three municipalities prepared risk assessments. The Danish DPA reviewed these and assessed that none of them fulfill all the minimum requirements. The other two did not prepare them and were ordered by the DPA to prepare them within three months.

Upon reviewing the impact and risk assesments. the DPA  highlighted several general observations:

Clarification of Data Responsibility: the Danish DPA stressed the importance of clearly defining data responsibility (such as who is the relevant controller), especially in collaborative systems like AULA, to ensure proper risk and impact assessments.

Documentation of Assessments: The DPA found variations in how municipalities documented their risk assessments, emphasising the need for a coherent documentation style to ensure GDPR compliance. Some of the municipalities' risk assessments even state that the processing of personal data in AULA did not involve high risks. A risk assessment under Article 32 GDPR, in the opinion of the DPA, should include an assessment of the consequence (e.g. high, medium, low) for the data subjects in case of loss of confidentiality, availability and integrity. The risk assessment should then identify the threats to loss of confidentiality, availability and integrity and the likelihood (e.g. high, medium, low) of the threat being realized. Finally, the risk assessment must map the existing security measures and their contribution to reducing the risk.

Risk of Error Transmission: A significant number of reported breaches involved the incorrect transmission of personal data within AULA. The DPA recommended exploring technical solutions to mitigate this risk. For example, AULA's message module is designed in such a way that it will send a message to the wrong recipient. Suggestions for recipients are automatically made when the user starts typing in the recipient field ""To"". In this connection, employees, children and parents are suggested as recipients. In the opinion of the DPA, this entails a risk that users select one or more incorrect recipients in the list of suggested recipients

Rights Management and Access Control: The DPA emphasized the need for robust access controls and periodic audits to prevent unauthorised access to personal data. Article 32(1)(d) GDPR states that, where appropriate, procedures shall be established for periodic testing, assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure security of processing. The controller should at a minimum, continuously check whether access to systems and physical material containing personal data is limited to those users who have a legitimate need for access to the information. It is not sufficient that user access to AULA is simply added and removed locally in the individual institutions and locally at the schools without a subsequent periodic check of whether the users in question still need the access they have been granted.

The DPA also issued recommendations:

Joint Impact Assessment and Code of Conduct: It suggested that municipalities consider preparing joint impact assessments and a code of conduct to streamline data protection efforts, especially when using shared systems like AULA.

Managing the Risk of Error Transmission: It recommended that municipalities explore technical measures to reduce the risk of error transmission within AULA's messaging function by changing its messaging features.

The DPA informed all Danish municipalities, including those that were not selected for the inspection. The purpose was to encourage all municipalities to consider the implementation of additional security measures in relation to their processing of personal data in AULA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 32, Article 25"
"Between March 2022 and October 2022, the French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out on-site inspections of TAGADAMEDIA (“controller”), as well as online inspections of their website. The CNIL discovered that the controller collected data (first name, surname, date of birth, postal address, e-mail address, phone number) from prospects through forms when offering them to participate in competitions or product testing on its website.

The controller used two forms to do so: before 2017, the controller used a single-button form – below the fields allowing data subjects to enter their details, there was a single “I VALIDATE” button with a green background and an arrow. Above the button, a text in a much smaller font stated that by clicking on the button, the user accepted that the data collected would be used to send offers from the controller’s partners and hyperlinks provided access to the data protection policy. The end of the text indicated that if the data subject wished to continue without receiving offers from the company’s partners, they could click on a link in the text (“I click here”), allowing the data subject to accept, or refuse that their personal data be sent to the controller’s partners.

The second form implemented from 2017 until the notification of the sanction report in 2023 was a two-button form with an “I VALIDATE” button written in white on a red background and an “I REFUSE” button written in black on a grey background, in a font smaller than the first button. Above these buttons, a text written in a font much smaller than that used for the buttons specified that by clicking on the ""I VALIDATE"" button, the user accepted that the data collected would be used to send offers from the company's partners.

The CNIL initiated a sanctioning procedure against the controller on 22 June 2023. During this procedure, the controller proposed a new form composed of an “I ACCEPT” button and a “NEXT STEP” button, both written in white on a red background and having a text in a much smaller font specifying that by clicking on the “I ACCEPT” button, the data subject accepted that the data would be used to send them offers from the controller’s partners, whereas the “NEXT STEP” button allowed them to continue without receiving offers from partners.","Firstly, the controller based its processing on consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The DPA reiterated that it is necessary to ensure that data subjects have given their unambiguous, specific, free and informed consent.

Regarding the one-button form, the CNIL considered that the form did not allow data subjects to make a valid choice reflecting their preferences regarding the transmission of data for commercial purposes. The CNIL emphasized on the fact that the “I VALIDATE” button had a size and colour that made it stand out from the other information provided, whereas the hyperlink which enabled the data subject to take part in the game without agreeing to the transmission of their data was presented in the body of the text and in much smaller characters.

Regarding the two-button form, the CNIL noted that there was no mention of the consequences of clicking on the “I REFUSE” button and that as designed, the form did not make it possible to obtain unambiguous and free consent from the user under Article 4(11) GDPR.

Regarding the new form, the CNIL considered that although the two buttons were identical in size, font and colour, the “NEXT STEP” button suggested that there was a sequence between these two buttons. Therefore, the choices in design did not compensate for the risk that the data subject may consent without measuring the consequences.

Thus, the CNIL considered that the forms did not sufficiently inform the data subjects that they were consenting to the transmission of their data for commercial prospecting purposes and that the controller did not have valid consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 4(11) GDPR.

Secondly, the CNIL discovered that the phone number and postal address of data subjects who refused to have their data transmitted to the controller’s partners were nonetheless transmitted for another purpose (the performance of technical and qualification operations) and on another legal basis (legitimate interest). The CNIL considered that in order to transmit this data to its partners, and insofar as it had chosen the legal basis of consent for this processing, the controller should have obtained the consent of the data subjects, therefore breaching Article 6 GDPR, as well as Article 5(1)(b) GDPR.

Thirdly, Article 30 GDPR stipulates that the controller must keep a register of processing activities. The CNIL noted that the controller shared a register of processing activities with another company but did not specify which one of the companies was acting as the controller for each processing. The DPA concluded that given the amount of data processed in its activity, the controller should have ensured that its register was exhaustive, accurate and up to date. Therefore, the controller failed to comply with Article 30 GDPR but did update its register during the sanctioning procedure.

Fourthly, Article 32(1) GDPR provides that the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk. The CNIL considered that despite the use of a single administration account to access the database, the controller required a connection to a VPN using individual authentication keys which allowed access and actions carried out within the database to be attributed, given the small number of people accessing the administration account. Therefore, the DPA established that there was no infringement of Article 32 GDPR.

The CNIL imposed a €75,000 fine for the infringements to Article 6 GDPR and Article 30 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 30"
"The Italian DPA, received the news about a new AI-driven surveillance system implemented by the municipality of Trento, the controller, with the support of FBK, a research foundation. In the context of this social experiment, the controller allowed the deployment of three projects, “Marvel” and “Protector”, concluded by now, and “Precrisis” still to be activated, using AI systems that were developed by the foundation in order to collect data from public areas in the municipality by means of videocameras and microphones that could serve the aim of preventing potential situations of danger to the public.

Upon learning about these facts, the DPA initiated an investigation into the processing operations related to the above mentioned projects by the controller and asked it to provide further information.

Among other things, the controller specified that the projects were EU-funded and provided details about the technical functioning of each of them. In particular, “Marvel” is aimed at developing an automated system analysing real-time audiovisual scenes in order to detect urban security issues. The foundation has access to the recordings of the public cameras in the municipality, which are instantly anonymized and analysed in the workstations of the foundation. The “Protector” project instead is aimed at improving security around places of worship, especially against the risk of hate crimes and terror attacks. The platform acquires video data from cameras present in the areas around places of worship and textual data derived from social media hate comments which are then elaborated by an AI system in order to detect possible relevant risks. Here too, the foundation has real-time access to the recordings which are instantly anonymized. Lastly, as regards the “Precrisis” project, the controller submitted that this has not been implemented yet but will be activated soon, upon adopting the necessary measures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.

Further, the controller submitted, with regard to all three projects, that the legal basis for such processing is Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and the controller referred to an Italian law that grants competence to municipalities to adopt video-surveillance systems to improve urban security. Further, the controller claimed that since the projects are still in their development stage, the provisions of the GDPR would only start applying when these are activated. Moreover, the controller added that such research projects would also be carried out in line with the provision in Article 89 GDPR. Last, the controller submitted that it nominated the foundation as a processor under Article 28 GDPR for the future processing of personal data that will take place once the projects are activated.

The DPA responded to these and further submissions by the controller stating that it would start proceedings aimed at the adoption of corrective measures against the controller for unlawful processing activities.","Following an extensive investigation, the DPA came to its conclusions regarding the processing of personal data by the controller.

The DPA found, with respect to the first two projects, that the controller was carrying out processing of personal data relating to criminal conviction and offences under Article 10 GDPR, as they were specifically aimed at ensuring public safety, which might include the processing of crimes. In addition, the DPA held that the cameras were already present in the territory of the municipality with the aim of detecting and documenting criminal activity and the algorithms used by the processor were trained to recognize potential situations of risk to the public. Further, the DPA did not believe that the controller could claim in good faith that no actual processing was being carried out, as the controller itself indicated the roles, purposes and legal basis for such processing. The DPA also did not accept other arguments that the controller brought in its defence denying its role as controller with relation to certain activities. On the contrary, the DPA confirmed its role and the fact that it may be subject to the imposition of a fine, even if certain activities were carried out by a processor on its behalf, making reference to C-683/21.

The DPA then assessed the anonymization techniques in place. The controller submitted that it adopted anonymization techniques right after collecting the data: the alteration of voice sounds in the voice recordings and the blurring of people’s faces in the videos. The DPA found these techniques to be inadequate as they did not guarantee a full anonymization of the personal data collected. Also, with respect to the data collected from social media platforms, the data were merely pseudonymysed and did not anonymized, as the controller claimed, hence their processing had to be compliant with the GDPR.

Furthermore, the DPA found that the data was being processed contrary to the principles of legality, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

As regards the principle of legality, the DPA considered that the national and local law granting the municipality generic competence on the development of social, cultural and economic projects identified by the controller cannot constitute a valid legal basis in line with Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, Article 6(2) and (3) GDPR nor with Article 9(2)(g) GDPR. Making reference to case law of the CJEU and of the ECtHR and taking into account Article 52(1) CFREU, the DPA held that, for processing to be based on a law, the law itself must provide for specific rules on the scope and limits to the processing operations and the processing must be reasonably expected by the data subjects. Similarly, the DPA held that the controller could not justify the processing on the basis of the law on “urban security” which allows the use of cameras for the sole purpose of contrasting and preventing crime and could not be used for further processing. Also with respect to the controller’s defence that the processing could also be based on Article 89 GDPR, the DPA held that the controller as a municipality failed to prove that it is to be considered a research institute. In light of this, the DPA also considered that the sharing of poorly anonymized or pseudonymized personal data to the processor occurred in violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and lacked a legal basis. Hence, so the DPA, the controller acted in violation of Articles 5, 6, 9 and 10 GDPR.

As regards transparency, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 13(1)(c) and (e) GDPR, Article 13(2)(a), (b) and (d) and Article 14 GDPR as it failed to properly provide information about the processing operations.

Lastly, the DPA also held that the controller violated Article 35 GDPR as it failed to properly carry out a DPIA and it should have also considered consulting the DPA prior to processing according to Article 36 GDPR, as the case involved large scale public surveillance.

In light of the above findings and considering the provision in Article 83(2) and (3) GDPR, the DPA held that it was appropriate to impose a fine in the amount of €50,000 on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 10, Article 13, Article 14, Article 35, Article 83"
"Following four previous decisions by the Danish DPA into the usage of Google Chromebooks and Workspace for Education by the municipality of Helsingor, the DPA began its investigation into 53 Danish municipalities, between 8 September and 24 October 2022,  regarding their use of Google Chromebooks and Workspace for Education.

The DPA requested the municipalities for further clarifications and also asked them to carry out a data protection impact assessment. On 12 September 2022, the DPA was informed by the KL (Local Government Denmark) to be representing the municipalities and that it would submit a joint response on behalf of all affected municipalities. On 30 June 2023, the KL provided the DPA with a complete response containing documentation by all municipalities.","The DPA stressed that processing of personal data is lawful if done on the basis of Article 6(1) GDPR. Specifically, public authorities can process personal data to carry out a task in the public interest under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, as in the present instance.

Indeed, the DPA noted that under section 2(1) and section 18(1) Folkeskoleloven (The Public School Act), the municipalities, as part of their responsibility for primary and lower secondary schools, have the power to organise the teaching environment, such as select teaching and working methods, teaching materials, etc.

However, during the investigation, the DPA found that from the students' usage of Google Chromebooks and Workspace for Education, Google received and processed for its own purposes data about the individual student's use of the tools, including information about the computer's settings, about the use of the tools, applications, and Chrome browser.

Consequently, the DPA stated that the municipalities could not, under section 2(1) and section 18(1) of the Public School Act, in conjunction with Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, share the students’ personal data for purposes related to maintain and improve Google Workspace for Education, ChromeOS and Chrome browser, and measure performance and develop new functions and services in ChromeOS and Chrome browser. Indeed, these purposes did not only cover the development of the specific teaching and learning resources purchased by the municipalities but also the general development of Google's products. Meanwhile, according to the Public School Act, the municipalities could not disclose personal data about students to the supplier of teaching and learning resources for the purpose of the supplier's general further development of its IT products using this information.

Therefore, the DPA established that the municipalities breached Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and  ordered all 53 municipalities to bring their processing in line with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, Article 6(1) GDPR, by ensuring they have a legal basis for all processing activities, and be able to demonstrate this in line with Article 5(2) GDPR.

The DPA also suggested three ways of achieving compliance, although only as examples since it is up to the municipalities, as the controllers, to determine and decide how to comply with the DPA's order. Two of these cases necessarily involve the intervention of another entity:

* Stop sharing personal data with Google for purposes where they lack a legal basis;
* For Google to stop processing personal data for these purposes;
* For the Danish Parliament to create a legal basis for the processing.

The municipalities have until 1 March to report their solution to the DPA and must ensure that their processing is compliant before 1 August.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 58"
"On 23 March 2023, an employee of the controller consulted an extract of the data subject's personal data stored in the Belgian National Register, which refers to the information processing system that records, memorizes and communicates information relating to the identification of Belgian citizens.

After that, the data subjectfiled an access request with the controller, requesting clarification into who accessed their data and for what purpose.  Due to not receiving any response regarding the access request, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA on 14 June 2023.

On 7 August 2023, the controller replied to the access request, acknowledging that it consulted the National Register records of the data subject and that the processing was performed by a professional with specific authorization. However, due to professional secrecy, the controller could not disclose the professional's identity or assess whether the consultation complied with legal and ethical obligations.","The Belgian DPA stressed that the controller, in its capacity, must comply with a request made by a data subject pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR, in compliance with the conditions set out in Article 12 GDPR, and to provide the data subject with information on the measures taken, as soon as possible and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.

Furthermore, the DPA noted that pursuant to Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24 GDPR, the controller should be able to demonstrate its compliance with the data protection principles.

In light of the facts of the case, considering that the complainant clearly exercised their right to access under Article 15 GDPR, that on 14 June 2023, the data subject complained to have not received any answer and that the controller only replied on 7 August 2023, the controller exceeded the deadline established in Article 12(3) and (4) GDPR.

Therefore, the Belgian DPA found the controller to have breached Article 15 GDPR in conjunction with Article 12(3) and (4) GDPR, and it mandated the controller to comply with the data subject's access request within 30 days from the notification of the decision. Additionally, the controller was ordered to inform the DPA about the actions taken in response to the decision within the same timeframe.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 15, Article 24"

By decisions of the Local Council, it was established how the inhabitants of Sector 1 could submit the necessary documents to benefit from the financial incentives of the programme: in physical format or via e-mail. However, the controller had made available also an online platform for data collection that had been purchased before the decision was approved by the Local Council.","During the investigation, the controller failed to respond to the Romanian DPA's repeated requests for information in accordance with the provisions of Article 58(1)(a) and (e) GDPR, which led to the DPA issuing a warning to the controller.

"The Italian DPA conducted an investigation into the compliance of the Municipality of Syracuse with Article 37(7) GDPR. During the investigation, it was discovered that the Municipality had failed to fulfil its obligation to designate a DPO and communicate their contact details to the DPA, as required by Article 37 GDPR.

Also the “Guidelines on Data Protection Officers”, adopted by the Article 29 Working Party outline the requirements for designating a DPO and communicating their contact details to the DPA. The Italian DPA even established in the ""Documento di indirizzo su designazione, posizione e compiti del Responsabile della protezione dei dati (RPD) in ambito pubblico"" a dedicated online procedure for entities to use in communicating the DPO's contact details. This procedure served as the sole authorised channel for such communications and was designed to ensure the efficient and secure transfer of information between entities and the DPA.

"Société Particulier à Particulier - Editions Neressis (""controller"") provides individuals with a set of publications and services allowing them to conclude real estate transactions without intermediaries. The CNIL conducted an online investigation of their website, www.pap.fr, to verify the methods of informing people about their rights as data subjects, and whether the procedure for creating a user account was sufficiently secure and confidential.

The on-site investigation focused on the verification of the retention periods applied to user account data, the legality of data processor agreements in place and the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the data collected through the website.

During its investigations, the CNIL found that the controller defined a systematic retention period of ten years from the acceptance of an order on the website. The CNIL also discovered that the controller did not include the right to lodge a complaint with the DPA, the legal basis for each processing as well as the recipients and categories of recipients in their privacy policy.

The CNIL initiated a sanctioning procedure against the controller on 6 February 2023.","Firstly, regarding the retention periods, the CNIL considered that a retention period of ten years from the date of acceptance of the order was justified by its legal obligations resulting from French law, in particular Articles L.213-1, D.213-1 and D.213-2 Consumer Code, for contracts worth more than €120. Therefore, the CNIL considered that for contracts that were less than €120, the 10 year retention period was excessive and therefore breaches Article 5(1)(e) GDPR.

Additionally, while the CNIL agreed that a 5 year retention period commencing from the date of last connection to the user account was justified for legal proceedings and anti-fraud purposes, more than 2 million user accounts of between 5 and 10 years old had been retained, as well as more than 700,000 accounts more than 10 years old. The retention of data beyond what was necessary for the announced purpose constituted a breach of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR.

Secondly, the CNIL indicated that the controller breached Article 13 GDPR by failing to include the right to lodge a complaint to the CNIL, together with inaccurate data retention period information, in the privacy policy. The CNIL noted that this information helps users to control the processing of their data, and thereby ensures fair and transparent processing.

Thirdly, the CNIL found that the controller had breached Article 28(3) GDPR where it had tried to retroactively amend one of its data processor agreements to include all requirements of this Article. The CNIL held that the retroactive nature of the amendment cannot cover the breach for the past.

Finally, the CNIL considered that the controller breached Article 32 GDPR in several ways. Firstly, users were not required to provide strong passwords when creating an account, accounts were not locked after a certain number of failed access attempts, and part of a reference code used instead of an account (if the user did not wish to create one) was made publicly available by forming part of the ad reference number. The CNIL found that the above measures, given the current state of the art, were not sufficient to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the data being processed. Secondly, the controller failed to intermediately archive inactive customer data (kept for 10 years) and inactive user account data (kept for 5 years). The CNIL found that the mixing of inactive data in an active database, which the controller explained was for daily anti-fraud checks, did not ensure adequate data security. A large number of employees could access the data, and some of the retained data was not needed for anti-fraud checks (such as advertising details and billing addresses).

For breaching Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 28 and 32 GDPR the CNIL imposed a €100,000 to the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 28, Article 32"
"The Italian DPA was informed that a general practitioner (the controller) was processing the personal data of his patients in breach of the principles of integrity and confidentiality.

On the exterior wall of the controller’s office, there was a mailbox and a metal box without any names, and on the box, there was the indication ""only medical prescriptions"" with a key inserted in the lock. This box was freely accessible to the public and was located on a public square. Inside the box, there were numerous medical prescriptions, not placed inside closed envelopes, issued to different subjects.

This practice was corroborated by other seven patients of the controller, who confirmed that this system had begun during the COVID-19 pandemic and was kept afterwards.

Considering that the described conduct was not found to conform to the relevant data protection rules, the DPA notified the controller of the opening of the procedure pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR.","To begin, the DPA noted that the data in question fell within the scope of Article 4(15) GDPR as data concerning health, which require more data protection since their processing could cause severe risks to the data subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms, as noted in Recital 51 GDPR.

The DPA further observed that pursuant to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, the controller should have respected the principles of integrity and confidentiality. Thus, the controller should have adopted technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk under Article 32 GDPR.

Considering that the data in question fell within Article 9 GDPR, the DPA stated that health data could be shared with third parties only based on an appropriate legal basis or at the request of the data subject. Furthermore, Article 2-septies(8) of the Italian Privacy Code also expressly prohibits the dissemination of data that may reveal the state of health of data subjects.

Referring to its own press releases from 2014 and 2015, the DPA stated that to avoid third parties from accessing sensitive data such as health data: it is essential that prescriptions are delivered in a sealed envelope. Moreover, the DPA indicated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the electronic prescription number had been envisaged with the aim of preventing patients from going to a general practitioner’s office to withdraw a prescription. Alternative that the controller should have used.

Consequently, considering that the controller violated Article 5 GDPR, Article 9 GDPR and Article 32 GDPR, as well as Article 2-septies(8) of the Italian Privacy Code and that the controller’s responsibility was high, the DPA fined the controller €20,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 32"
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a municipality-run educational institution (the controller) processed the personal data of its students for the marketing of courses offered by a third party without the consent of its students. The DPA asked the controller to explain the purpose of the personal data processing.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that a teacher had sent the students an email in which the teacher advertised their own course in another organisation. The controller emphasised that sending the email in question was not related to the activities of the controller.

The controller claimed that the email in question had been sent against the controller's instructions. According to the controller's privacy notice, personal data was not disclosed to third parties for direct marketing.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the email sent from the controller's information system was promoting services offered by another organisation and that such use of the personal data was comparable to disclosure.

The DPA emphasised that in accordance with Article 32(4) GDPR, the controller must ensure that its employees have sufficient understanding and competence regarding the processing of personal data and data protection.

The DPA stated that the controller must also comply with Section 16(3) of the Finnish Act on the Openness of Government Activities, according to which the disclosure of personal data for direct marketing requires the data subject's consent. Since there was no legal basis to disclose the students' personal data, the controller processed the personal data in violation of the lawfulness principle.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, as the processing of personal data was not related to the activities of the controller and there were no legal grounds for the processing. The controller's purpose in collecting the personal data was for processing related to college operations. As the advertisement for another organisation did not relate to college operations, the DPA also found a violation of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR.

As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 58"
"Following several compaints, the DPA launched an ""ex officio"" investigation. The controller (Client 1, Pitagorasz Oktatási Stúdió Kft) organises preparation courses for entry exams to secondary schools. It sent letters to students of different age (who are probably interested in applying for an entry exam), addressed to the students but mentioning that they are destined (also) to their caretakers. The addresses were received from the official government register, quoting as purpose market research. There is a law enabling this, but since 2019, this is not possible for direct marketing in respect of private individuals. The letters were sent after the registration to the courses was closed. Parents were informed about the source of the data at the bottom of the letters, and that the use of the data was terminated when the letter was forwarded. The information on the letter and in the legal basis could give the impression that this was an official communication and based on a legal obligation. The letter itself did not contain a market research questionnaire and could not be returned by mail. It hinted to an on line questionnaire which could be filled in. The privacy statement was not provided, it was only mentioned that it is available on the homepage of the controller (not a specific link to the statement itself). The information on the privacy statement mixed the processing of addresses used for sending the letters, the processing of registrations and of responses to the on line questionnaire. Different pieces of information (registration form, privacy statement etc.) contained differing information as to the legal basis of processing. The information given for consent was incomplete. The DPA acquired information from the provider of a mailing software and database used. It was established that this provider did not have access to the personal data, was neither controller, nor processor. The DPA investigated the database and found data of different groups of data subjects in it, including those who filled in the on line questionnaire, registrants and even lecturers. Not all data were collected on line, some were entered into the database manually. The fact of consent was not indicated at all data subjects whose data were processed based on consent. An assessment of interest was not conducted for the processing based on legitimate interest. Data of data subjects who meanwhile withdrew consent (were inactive) were not removed in time and were found in the database. Controller also enabled registrations to a newsletter and to send information about course organisation but did not separate the consent to these two different purposes.","The controller infringed the principles of - accountability as it did not prove the existence of legitimate interest in processing the data of the addressees of the mailing - lawfulness as the legal basis of the mailings was not proven - purpose limitation in respect of some mailings as the purpose was different from what was stated - fairness as it stated a wrong reason for requesting the data from the official register - lawfulness in respect of sending the newsletters  - transparency as it did not provide appropriate information to the registrants - the rights of the data subjects by not deleting their data when consent was withdrawn. The DPA ordered the controller to permanently delete the data stored in its database of the data subjects who unsubscribed from the newsletter, or whose contact information was unsuccessful, in a documented manner, levied a fine and ordered to publish the decision. Alleviating circumstances were mainly that during the investigation, the practice was already discontinued and that the reason of the infringement was negligent and not intentional.

"The Finnish DPA was notified that a school (the controller) had requested the guardians of all its students to provide the students' bank account numbers for the payment of a possible scholarship. The DPA had asked the controller to explain for what purpose it processed the bank account numbers of all its students.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that scholarships were normally physically awarded to the recipients at the end of the semester. Due to the pandemic, it was decided to pay the scholarship directly to the student's bank account. The controller also stated that it did not want to reveal in advance which students will receive the scholarships. Thus, to speed up the process, the controller had requested the bank account numbers of all its students.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that personal data may not be processed and stored only for the sake of certainty and for future use. The controller had unnecessarily processed the bank account numbers of all its students for the purpose of awarding the scholarships, even though they are only awarded to certain students. The DPA emphasised that it would have been possible for the controller to award the scholarships in a less intrusive manner.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(c) GDPR by processing the bank account numbers of all its students. As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.

"A healthcare provider (the controller) had submitted a data breach notification to the Finnish DPA, according to which the CEO had left their bag outside without supervision and the bag had been stolen. Inside the bag was a laptop, external hard drives and paper documents containing, among other things, patients' health data.

The controller stated that the laptop was turned off and the login was protected with a password, but the laptop's mass storage or the personal data it contained had not been encrypted. The external hard drives contained backups of the controller's system, which were likely encrypted.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the password protection used by the controller had been a clearly inadequate method to protect the personal data stored on the laptop. If a third party gains a physical access to the device, the password does not prevent transferring the mass storage to another device and reading the content of the unencrypted mass storage on this other device.

The DPA emphasised that accessing data on external hard drives may be even easier, for example by connecting the drive to a third-party device and viewing its contents. For this reason, especially high-risk personal data must be adequately protected and the devices containing that data must be stored carefully.

The DPA stated that when paper documents end up in the possession of a third party, it has direct access to the information contained in the documents. Paper documents must be handled in such a way that they are not accessible to third parties, and they must not be taken outside without proper protection and supervision.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR by failing to comply with its obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as encryption, to prevent unauthorised access to personal data. The personal data could have been encrypted with various encryption software, the use of which would not have required disproportionate effort or resources from the controller.

"In 2023, as part of a wider initiative led by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA) like the majority of the members of the EDPB, jointly undertook the examination of the topic ""The definition and position of the data protection officer"". To facilitate this examination, the EDPB developed a unified questionnaire, which the Hellenic DPA adopted. Later on May 3, 2023, the Hellenic DPA exercising its investigative powers sent the questionnaire to 31 public bodies in Greece, including the Municipality of Athens (hereinafter ""Controller""), with a deadline for submission via the EUsurvey link until May 19, 2023.

The DPO of the Controller (hereinafter “DPO"") failed to respond to the questionnaire within the set deadline. The Hellenic DPA re-sent the questionnaire on May 26, 2023, with a new deadline of May 31, 2023. Once again, the DPO failed to respond in time. The DPO, after the deadline expired, attempted to complete the form without success as the above link had been deactivated by the Hellenic DPA. Upon DPO’s communication with Hellenic DPA, the link was reactivated, and the data controller was informed of a new deadline for submission until June 21, 2023. Once again, the DPO failed to submit the questionnaire in time.

The controller was then summoned by the Hellenic DPA to appear before the plenary on Tuesday, December 19, 2023. The DPO contacted the DPA by telephone and informed that he had inadvertently failed to respond due to technical issues and undertook to complete and submit it immediately. After which, the Hellenic DPA reactivated the submission link to the questionnaire, and the controller finally submitted the questionnaire on December 18, 2023. At the plenary meeting, which was held in person, the DPO stated once again that the reason for the delayed response was technical issues with the website where the questionnaire was held, which prevented submission even after several attempts.","The Hellenic DPA noted that the controller had an obligation to cooperate with the DPA under Article 31 GDPR and Article 66 Greek Law 4624/2019, as well as the obligation to designate the DPO under Article 37 GDPR and Article 6 Greek Law 4624/2019. Additionally, the position of the DPO under Article 38 GDPR and the tasks of the DPO under Article 39 GDPR.

After the investigation, the Hellenic DPA held that the controller did not submit the questionnaire in due time and that the allegations of technical issues were not valid as the link was operational and was deactivated only after the deadline for submission of the questionnaire had expired. It was subsequently reactivated in order to allow the questionnaire to be resubmitted to the controller, but again, no response was received.

The Hellenic DPA determined that the controller's actions constitute a breach of their obligations.

"On 03.05.2023 the HDPA sent a single questionnaire to be completed on the designation and position of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) to selected public bodies, such as the Ministry of Rural Development and Food. The deadline for submission of the questionnaire was set for 19 May 2023. The Ministry of Rural Development and Food did not submit the questionnaire on time and a new closing date of 31.05.2023 was set. Despite being urged by the authority, the questionnaire was not submitted.

On 28.11.2023, the authority sent a summons to the Ministry of Rural Development and Food to be heard on 19.12.2023. The Ministry of Rural Development and Food in a memorandum clarified that the contract of the DPO of the Ministry had expired on 04. 08.2022, while a new DPO was appointed on 20.06.2023; in the interim period, during which there was no designated DPO, it was stated that a personal data protection and security plan was in place and that the data subjects did not suffer any harm. Further, they claimed that an employee of the Directorate of Administrative Organization and Supervision of Legal Entities of the Ministry after receiving the second letter on 26.05.2023 immediately proceeded to complete and submit the questionnaire, which could not be done due to a technical error.","The HDPA assessed the above facts and the late submission of the questionnaire, but also the failure to inform the authority about the technical problem faced by the Ministry, as claimed.

"The controller, Klarna Bank AB, commonly referred to as Klarna, is a Swedish fintech company that provides online financial services. The company provides payment processing services for the e-commerce industry, managing store claims and customer payments. The company is a ""buy now, pay later"" service provider.

A Klarna Bank AB customer in Germany contacted the controller in June 2020 to rectify their registered email address as per Article 16 GDPR.

The controller’s customer service initially replied to the data subject that changing the email address was technically impossible as it was associated with the their credit card. The controller encouraged them to create a new Klarna account to change their email address. A new Klarna account would however influence the claimant’s credit standing. Klarna stated that email addresses were used as personal identifiers, and as part of a verification proces. This is why, if the data subject wanted to update their email address, a new Klarna account, which would be associated new email, would have to be created.

In July 2020, the claimant requested the deletion of their personal data including the destruction of the Klarna account. As the data subject still had open invoices on their Klarna account, the controller deleted the account and added his new e-mail as an internal reference for the unpaid invoices.

The data subject complained to a German supervisory authority about the inadequate fulfilment of their right to rectification in Article 16 GDPR. On the basis of Article 56 GDPR the complaint was passed on to Swedish DPA ('IMY') as the LSA.","The Swedish DPA held that the controller processed personal data in violation of:

1) Article 12(2) GDPR, by not enabling the data subject to exercise their right to rectification stated in Article 16 GDPR. Article 12(2) GDPR thus includes an obligation for the controller to to proactively design solutions that make it easy for the data subject to exercise their rights. Klarna instead had a system which would force the data subject to create a new account. This would adversly affect his credit score with his bank. The excercise of his right as envisaged by the controller would result in a negative consequence to the data subject.

2) Article 16 GDPR, by not enabling the data subject to change their email address as requested. The controller had a system where data linked to an already issued card could be changed. This meant that data could not be rectified, even when it was outdated or incorrect. A controller cannot use the design of its own systems as an excuse to derogate from its obligations under the GDPR.

The Swedish DPA decided to reprimand Klarna Bank AB based on Article 58(2)(b) GDPR and Recital 148 for a minor infringement. The infringement was ruled as a minor because it only impacted one person.

"On 20 September 2021, following the Taliban's ascent to power, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) sent an email to a list of individuals eligible for evacuation from Afghanistan using the ‘To’ field rather than the ‘blind carbon copy’ (‘Bcc’) field. Following this incident, the MoD identified that two similar incidents involving the staff in charge of the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy had already occurred.  Overall, 265 unique email addresses were disclosed.

The UK DPA (Information Commissioner's Office, ICO) started and investigation and found that the email addresses could be seen by all recipients, with 55 people having thumbnail pictures on their email profiles. Additionally, MoD confirmed that two people ‘replied all’ to the entire list of recipients, with one of them providing their location.","The ICO’s investigation found that the MoD infringed Article 5(1)(f) (UK) GDPR by failing to have appropriate technical and organization measures in place compromising the security of personal data. This Article is substantially equivalent to the duty of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

The ICO determined that, at the time of the infringement, the MoD did not have operation procedures in place to ensure group emails were sent securely to individuals seeking relocation from Afghanistan. Instead, the staff in charge had to rely on the MoD's broader email policy and were not given specific guidance about the security risks of sending group emails when communicating sensitive information. The ICO noted that this human error led to the potential for unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, putting the individuals’ lives at risk. Due to the risk of Taliban reprisals against supporters of Western forces, ICO emphasized that the personal data were highly sensitive and required careful handling.

Accordingly, the ICO imposed the fine on the MoD in the amount of €409,080 (GBP 350,000). The ICO explained that the fine was reduced from an initial amount of €1,168,700 (GBP 1,000,000) to €818,090 (GBP 700,000) in recognition of the unusual and urgent circumstances of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the data subject had been treated at the controller's premises by a surgeon from another company, which is an independent controller of its patient records. The controller does not have access to that company's patient records.

The controller stated its patients may access their personal data by visiting the controller's premises and that the personal data is not sent by email.

The DPA had asked the controller to explain how it facilitated the exercise of data subject rights. In addition, the DPA also asked the controller to clarify how long it retained personal data.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it could not confirm the identity of the data subject because the access request had been submitted by email, which only contained the name and email address of the data subject.

Firstly, EDF failed to comply with its obligation to obtain the consent of the persons concerned for the implementation of commercial prospecting by electronic means as prescribed in Article 7(1) of GDPR. This was due to the fact that EDF was unable to provide proof of validly expressed consent by prospects whose data stems from data brokers prior to canvassing. In particular, the data broker was merely able to produce the standard form, as opposed forms completed individually by each prospect.

Secondly, the company failed to comply with its obligation to inform individuals as established in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR. There were shortcomings in the charter on personal data protection that appeared on the website of the company—no legal basis was mentioned and the periods of data retention were not sufficiently precise to ensure fair and transparent processing of the personal data.

Thirdly, the company did not comply with its obligations related to the exercise of individual rights. CNIL found a breach of the obligation of transparency, as prescribed in Article 12 of the GDPR—the company did not provide a written response containing correct information within the prescribed time limit in regards to referrals made by data subjects. The Commission also held that EDF violated its obligations under Article 15 of the GDPR, as it provided erroneous information on the source of the data collected as part of the request made by data subjects to invoke their right to access. Additionally, CNIL found that the company failed to take into account oppositions made to the processing of personal data, thereby failing to comply with its obligations under Article 21 of the GDPR.

Fourthly, EDF breached its obligation to guarantee data security as prescribed in Article 32 of the GDPR. In particular, the implemented hash function did not apply to a significant amount of accounts—as a result, such data was not stored securely. These concerns were exacerbated as the company did not systematically use a salt in the transformation of passwords, thus failing to guarantee both the security and confidentiality of the personal data of its customers.

The Commission therefore imposed a fine and sought an injunction, and publicized its declaration based on Article 83 of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 21, Article 32"
"On 23 September 2021, the French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out an inspection on Foriou’s premises (“controller”), in particular regarding the legal basis of the processing and the security measures taken. The controller was in the business of marketing and managing loyalty programs and cards. In order to promote its programs, until 2021, the controller carried out telephone canvassing campaigns using prospect files purchased with several data suppliers who collected the data via entry forms for online competitions. The personal data collected was the following: surname, first name, title, email address, date of birth and postal address.

During its investigations, the CNIL discovered that the data suppliers all had similar forms on their websites: there were fields which enabled the data subject to enter their contact details. Underneath these fields were a “Validate”, “I validate” or “I answer questions to apply” button. Above or below this button, a text specified that by clicking on it, the user declared that they read the data supplier’s data protection policy and accepts that the data collected would be used to send them offers from the company’s partners. Hyperlinks were provided to access the data protection policy as well as the list of partners concerned. However, the list did not mention the controller. At the end of the text it was specified that if the user wished to continue without receiving offers from the data supplier’s partners, they could click a link in the text (“click here”).

Therefore, data subjects could either click on the “Validate” button and accept that their data would be used to send them offers from the data supplier’s partners or on the “click here” link to continue without receiving these offers.

The controller also submitted 2 other forms in its observations. These forms contained “Validate my coordinates” and “Continue” buttons to validate participation in the game and transmit data to partners. The “click here” button remained unchanged and was still presented in the body of the text.

Regarding security measures, the CNIL found that the controller indicated that they would keep customer data for a period of 5 years from the date of the end of the contract in an active database with no intermediate archiving mechanism implemented.","Firstly, the CNIL indicated that Article 6(1) GDPR establishes the legal bases of processing. The DPA also pointed out that commercial prospecting by telephone can be carried out on the legal basis of the controller’s legitimate interest or on the basis of consent.

Regarding the controller’s legitimate interest, the CNIL added that the controller must ensure that the processing does not infringe the rights and interests of the data subject, taking into account their reasonable expectations. The CNIL held that regarding the fact that the controller was not listed as a partner from the data supplier, the controller could not rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to justify its commercial canvassing operations by telephone, as the protection of the interests, freedoms and fundamental rights of the data subjects took precedence over the legitimate interests of the controller.

Regarding consent, the CNIL stressed that concerning commercial canvassing operations, when the data subject’s data has not been collected directly from them by the canvassing organization, consent may be obtained by the initial collector on behalf of the organization that will carry out subsequent canvassing operations. If this is not the case, it is up to the prospecting organization to obtain such consent before proceeding with the processing. The CNIL considered that the design of the forms on the data supplier’s website did not allow data subject’s to express a valid choice as the interfaces particularly highlight the “Validate”, “I validate” or “I answer questions to apply” button, whose size and color make it stand out from the other information provided. The words used also suggested the conclusion of the data subject’s registration process rather than the transmission of data to partners and the location of the button on the form gave the impression that it must be clicked to complete the registration and take part in the competition. The CNIL also found that the hyperlink text which allowed data subjects to partake in the competition without agreeing to the transmission of their data to partners was presented in the body of the text in characters much smaller in size than those used for the buttons and without any particular emphasis. The CNIL also found that the forms submitted by the controller in its observations did not sufficiently inform the data subjects either. Therefore, the CNIL considered that the consent was not unambiguous and free as per required under Article 4(11) GDPR.

In the absence of a legal basis enabling the controller to base its commercial canvassing operations by telephone, the CNIL considered that a breach of Article 6 GDPR was constituted.

Secondly, the CNIL also pointed out that a simple contractual commitment by a data broker to comply with the GDPR as well as the rules applicable to commercial prospecting do not constitute a sufficient measure (see CNIL, SAN-2022-021). Thus, the DPA considered that the contractual obligations that the controller imposed on its suppliers did not exonerate the controller from its liability, despite the possible existence of liability on part of suppliers.

Finally, the CNIL noted that during the phase of current use, which corresponds to the time required to achieve the purpose of the processing, the data is kept in an “active base” and is accessible to all departments responsible for implementing and processing. At the end of this phase, when the data is no longer used to achieve the set objective, but is still of administrative use to the controller (for example the management of a possible dispute), it must be possible to consult only on an ad hoc basis and for a specific reason, by specially authorized people. With regards to this case, the CNIL held that the information they found did not make it possible to establish that persons would have access to the data without having a need to know. Therefore, the DPA concluded that there was no breach of Article 32 GDPR.

Thus, the CNIL imposed a €310,000 fine on the controller for breaching Article 6 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6, Article 32"
"On 22 October 2018, UniCredit S.p.A. (""controller"") notified the Italian DPA of a personal data breach that occurred on 21 October 2018. The breach occurred due to a cyberattack on the controller’s mobile banking portal for customers. Third parties tried to access customer accounts by attempting automatically-generated simple PINs.

The mobile banking portal had two vulnerabilities that facilitated the breach. First, the portal made customers’ personal data (first name, surname, tax code, and internal bank identification code) available in HTML responses to authentication attempts, including where attempts were unsuccessful. Second, the controller did not limit the use of simple PINs, making accounts vulnerable to cyberattacks aimed at identifying customer login information (brute force attacks).

Due to the HTML response vulnerability, every login attempt gave cyber attackers access to the names, tax codes, and internal bank identification codes of 777,765 present and former customers. In the case of 6,959 of those customers, the cyber attackers also successfully identified the portal PINs. The controller subsequently blocked the identified PINs. The breach did not include the data subjects’ banking data.

The controller did not consider the breach high-risk pursuant to Article 34 GDPR. It posted a general notice on its website and gave direct notice only to the 6,959 data subjects whose passwords were identified. The DPA disagreed, finding the breach likely to present a high risk to data subject rights after a preliminary investigation. On 13 December 2018, it enjoined the controller to communicate the personal data breach to all data subjects. The controller subsequently prepared differentiated notices, which the DPA found complied with Article 34(2) GDPR.

In a defense brief, the controller argued that it took preventive measures and mitigating controls which exceeded market standards at the time of the breach. Additionally, the controller argued that the breach occurred as a result of its data processor’s negligence. The processor was charged with carrying out vulnerability tests on the controller’s mobile webpage and application. Though it became aware of the mobile portal’s vulnerabilities on 19 October 2018 and identified them as high-level, the processor did not report these to the controller until 22 October 2018.","The DPA rejected the controller’s defense and found that it infringed Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1) and 32(2) GDPR. First, it noted that making personal data available to anyone attempting authentication regardless of success is intrinsically risky in the banking sector, where identified customers may be targeted in phishing attempts or similar attacks. Second, the DPA found that the controller’s failure to prevent simple PINs was a high-risk oversight given the frequency of simple brute force cyberattacks in the financial system. The DPA did not consider the processor’s actions in determining that the controller violated Article 5(1)(f), 32(1), and 32(2) GDPR.

The DPA issued a € 2,800,000 fine. In doing so, it balanced the large number of data subjects, previous DPA measures resulting from a prior data breach by the controller, and the loss of confidentiality with the controller’s cooperation during the DPA’s investigation, the exclusion of bank data from the breach, and the steps taken to mitigate the breach.

The DPA did not issue other corrective measures, taking into account the controller’s mitigations immediately after the breach and the lack of consumer complaints pursuant to Article 77 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 34"
"The Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs ('Minister') informed the DPA that the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland ('Consulate') sent, at the request of the District Court of Kraków ('Court'), correspondence through a postal operator to an addressee.

The addressee informed the Consulate that a delivered parcel was damaged, additionally wrapped and was incomplete. The infringement covered a various categories of personal data, namely first and last names, ID numbers, addresses of residence, dates of birth, bank account numbers, photographs. Personal data of two children were also breached.

The DPA identified the court as a controller of the data affected by the breach. It invited the Court to indicate whether a risk analysis had been done to assess whether a data protection breach required notifying the DPA and the affected individuals under Articles 33 and 34 GDPR. In its defence, the court referred to Article 175dd of the Law on the Common Court System, stating that the District Court of Kraków, under the President of the Court of Appeal in Krakow, is responsible for overseeing data processing in court proceedings and legal protection tasks.

As a response, the DPA clarified that it was the competent authority to investigate the infringement in question.

However, the Court reiterated its stance, referencing various articles of the Law on the System of Common Courts and a decision by the CJEU from March 24, 2022 (Case C-245/20). The Court emphasized that the protection of judicial independence is paramount, stating that judicial functions should be exercised independently without external interference or pressure. They asserted that the administration of justice encompasses all operations related to judicial activities, including informing parties about court proceedings.  Additionally, the Court referenced a decision by the DPA (no. ZSOŚS.440.109.2018) regarding the authority's reluctance to interfere with documents collected in court proceedings. Consequently, they argued that the DPA lacks the authority to control courts in matters related to adjudicatory activities.","In investigating the incident, the DPA assessed whether the reported event constituted a breach of personal data protection and whether the DPA was the competent authority to verify compliance with GDPR by the controller (the court) involved in the incident.

Referencing Article 4(12) GDPR, the DPA found that the event reported by the Minister, involving the delivery of damaged correspondence to the addressee, was considered a breach of personal data protection, as it compromised data confidentiality and availability. The Court did not disprove the occurrence of this event during the proceedings.

The DPA, as the competent supervisory authority, determined that the delivery of correspondence did not constitute judicial or legal protection by the Court but rather a technical administrative task. Therefore, the DPA was acting within its powers to assess the infringement. As Article 55(3) GDPR specifies that supervisory authorities cannot supervise processing operations carried out by courts in the administration of justice, the opposite applies to administrative activities of the court, such as the delivery of correspondence.

The Court's reference to C-245/20 was deemed unjustified as it pertained to the provision of information by a court in its judicial capacity, not while performing administrative activities. The DPA's intervention did not impinge on judicial independence but focused on rectifying data protection irregularities, aligning processing operations with GDPR provisions. These remedial actions did not interfere with pending proceedings or judicial competence but addressed administrative aspects of the court's activities.

The Court's reference to the previous decision of the DPA was also not applicable.

Furthermore, the Court of Appeal in Kraków could be considered the supervisory body for the notification of the breach in this case. According to Article 175dd of the Law on the Common Court System, judicial supervisory bodies are not authorized to receive notifications of personal data protection violations or assess high-risk situations resulting from such breaches.

Consequently, the DPA assessed the incident as a breach of confidentiality, regardless of the postal operator's fault. The assessment focused on the failure to report the breach and notify data subjects, which falls within the DPA's jurisdiction without interfering with court decisions.

The DPA found a breach of Article 33 GDPR and Article 34(1) and (2) GDPR resulting in a fine of €2,324.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 33, Article 34, Article 55"
"The Medtronic Diabetes is a medical technology firm focused on innovation of diabetes solutions such as developing the MiniMed Mobile app which displays insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring data. The app offers a direct connection with patient's healthcare provider through a 'CareLink' Personal software.

The team member of the firm emailed users of the MiniMed Mobile app in different countries within and outside the EU. The purpose was to notify them about a server maintenance update and the steps needed to regain access to the 'CareLink' Personal software as part of this update.

The member of the team included the recipients’ e-mail addresses in the ‘To’ field instead of the ‘Bcc’ field which stands for ‘Blind Carbon Copy’. As a result, around 5,000 email addresses of MiniMed Mobile app users worldwide were exposed, including 732 in Italy.

The email notification didn't contain personal data, but recipients' email addresses were visible. Medtronic swiftly notified the breach to the Italian DPA, attempting to recall all emails and instructing affected users to delete them. After the incident, the controller re-trained staff on email notification procedures and started implementing an automated tool to prevent such incidents in the future.

These email addresses were in some cases made up of a combination of first name and surname of the data subject, which made it possible to identify the person in question, thus indirectly disclosing data relating to their health within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR. The controller stressed that the content of the e-mail did not include any personal data but revealed that the recipients were users of the MiniMed Mobile app.

Based on this notification of the incident, the DPA requested further preliminary information.","In this case, the DPA scrutinized the company's actions regarding the sharing of personal health data via email notifications to a large number of recipients. The DPA concluded that the company failed to uphold the obligation to implement adequate security measures to protect personal data as per Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR. According to the DPA, the technical and organizational measures adopted by the Company were not suitable to guarantee a level of security adequate to the risk. This is the case in view of the personal data breach notified by the data controller as such and in view of the significant number of email addresses contained in a single notification.

Additionally, they found a breach of Article 9 GDPR, which concerns the processing of special categories of personal data, such as health data. In this case, the unauthorized disclosure of email addresses of individuals likely experiencing diabetic conditions constituted a breach due to inadequate security measures by the company.

Lastly, The DPA found a breach of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and Article 12 GDPR and Article 13 GDPR regarding the sharing of patient clinical data through the ""Health Partner Share"" feature which allowed the patient to link their account with that of their healthcare professional.  The violation stemmed from the company's failure to provide clear and transparent information regarding the processing of personal data during the linking of personal data. Specifically, the company's privacy policy lacked clarity regarding the legal basis for processing personal data, including health data, in the context of the feature.

For the aforementioned violations, the DPA imposed a fine of €300,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32"
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the controller (Verkkokauppa.com Oyj, an IT retailer) required customers to create a customer account in order to make online purchases. The DPA then asked the controller to explain why it required the creation of a customer account and for what purposes and for how long it stored the personal data of its customers.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the processing of customers' personal data was necessary for the provision of services and for the performance of a customer contract. The controller argued that it was able to reliably identify the data subject, demonstrate its accountability and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights through the customer account.

The controller explained that it sells long-life devices that may have very long warranty and defect liability periods. Therefore, it was in the customers' interest to have access to information and receipts regarding their online purchases through the customer account throughout the customer relationship.

The controller emphasised that if it allowed its customers to make online purchases without a customer account, it would have to process and store the personal data required for the placing and delivery of the order on an order-by-order basis, which would not be appropriate from a data security perspective and would not be in line with the principle of data minimisation.

The controller also stated that the contractual relationship was for an indefinite period, the duration of which was determined by the customer. Thus, the controller stored personal data until the customer account was deleted at the request of the data subject. The controller claimed that it was not in a position to assess on behalf of the customer how long the customer relationship should last.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the processing of personal data related to a single online purchase did not require the creation of a customer account, as it resulted in personal data being stored for longer than necessary. Therefore, the processing of personal data for the creation and maintenance of a customer account could not be considered necessary for the performance of an online purchase contract.

The DPA noted that the provisions on warranty and liability for defects are defined in the Finnish Consumer Protection Act, according to which the product has a defect for which the seller is responsible if the product lasts for a shorter period of time than reasonably expected. Thus, the duration of liability for defects is determined on a case-by-case basis based on the expected lifespan of the product.

The DPA stated that the consumer's right to seek remedies for the lack of conformity does not depend on whether the consumer has provided their personal data to the seller. Accordingly, the seller's obligation to remedy the lack of conformity is not affected by whether the seller has access to the consumer's personal data.

The DPA found that the controller had intentionally left the storage period of the personal data it processed for customer accounts completely undetermined, leaving the limitation of the storage period to the responsibility of the customer. As a result, the erasure of the personal data had to be requested by the data subject in accordance with Article 17 GDPR.

The DPA emphasised that the controller may not transfer the responsibility for the protection of personal data to the data subject. The storage of personal data cannot be justified by the fact that the data subject may later exercise their rights, such as requesting the erasure of their data.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(e) GDPR and Article 25(2) GDPR. As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR. Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA also ordered the controller to define a reasonable storage period for its customer data and to stop requiring its customers to create a customer account in order to make online purchases.

In addition to the reprimand and the order, the Sanctions Board of the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €856,000 on the controller under Article 83 GDPR, for failing to determine the storage period for its customer data. The Board considered that the controller's practice was intentional, long-lasting and affected a large number of data subjects.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 58, Article 83"
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the Finnish Motor Insurers' Centre (the controller) had requested unnecessary patient information from healthcare providers in order to settle claims. The DPA then asked the controller to explain how it processed patient information disclosed by healthcare providers for the purposes of settling claims.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that, according to Section 82 of the Finnish Motor Liability Insurance Act, it has the right, notwithstanding the obligation of confidentiality or other restrictions on access to information, to obtain statements made by healthcare providers and other information concerning the patients' medical records, health status, ability to work, treatment and rehabilitation.

The controller stated that it was impossible to process the claim without the claimants' medical records. The controller processed the patients' healthcare appointment data to determine whether the healthcare provider had charged for visits that were not related to the examination or treatment of injuries sustained in a traffic accident.

The controller emphasised that it followed the principle of data minimisation and that the patients’ healthcare appointment data were not requested unnecessarily. The controller also noted that it had to request a large amount of information in case the healthcare providers had omitted information necessary for claims handling.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that Section 82 of the Finnish Motor Liability Insurance Act does not give the controller the right to directly access all patient records, but that the information requested must be necessary for the settlement of the claim. As a general rule, insurance companies may not request all information about customers' healthcare appointments, but this information must be limited and specified on a case-by-case basis.

The DPA emphasised that, in addition to the necessity requirement under the Finnish Motor Liability Insurance Act, the controller must also comply with the data minimisation principle as well as data protection by design and default when receiving personal data. Accordingly, the controller should have reasonably limited the information requested, erased unnecessary information disclosed to it and ensured that it processed only personal data necessary for the purposes of the processing.

The DPA found that the processing of all information about the patients' healthcare appointments also failed to meet the fairness requirements for the processing of personal data, as the data subjects have a justified reason to expect that the insurance companies will only process the information necessary to settle the claim.

The DPA also noted that although it is the healthcare provider's responsibility to sort the information to be disclosed, insurance companies must still review all the information they receive and erase any unnecessary personal data. However, billing issues between healthcare providers and insurance companies must be resolved by means other than the systematic and large-scale collection of patient information.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and Article 25(2) GDPR. As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR. Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA also ordered the controller to comply with the principles of fairness and data minimisation as well as data protection by design and default when processing the patient information.

In addition to the reprimand and the order, the Sanctions Board of the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €52,000 on the controller pursuant to Article 83 GDPR.

"The National Council of Notaries (""the Council"") requested the DPA to investigate regarding the proper classification of the relationships between banks and notaries when, in the process of loan stipulation, certain lending banks utilize the services of a third-party company named ""Euro Servizi per i Notai S.r.l."" (""ESpN"") for managing document exchange with notaries through a platform known as PIGNA.

PIGNA is a service provided exclusively to banks by ESpN which is a computing service provider. It enabled banks and notaries, who handle tasks related to loan contracts and associated guarantees, to share required documents. This sharing occurred both before and after the contract was signed, except for a copy of the contract in enforceable form. Essentially, PIGNA facilitated the efficient exchange of necessary paperwork between these parties involved in the loan process.

Several concerns arose from the situation described. Firstly, the Council recommended an investigation with regards to the roles and responsibilities in the processing of personal data within the PIGNA platform. This includes notaries, banks, and ESpN. The concern revolved around the processing of personal data of borrowers, related third parties (like property sellers), and data concerning the notaries themselves.

Secondly, the relationship between PIGNA and individual notaries was unclear since notaries accessed the platform with authentication credentials provided by ESpN.

Thirdly, there were issues with the level of information provided to notaries and the sequence of notifications sent by PIGNA. It was highlighted that notaries receive a range of notifications via both the portal and email. In some instances, these notifications arrive unexpectedly, directly from the lending bank selected by the borrower. For instance, they may receive notice granting them authority to issue a mortgage loan, which is not necessarily communicated by the borrower's chosen lending bank.

Specifically, certain communications originating from platform accounts aim to offer notaries period report of borrower's personal data. These communications are accompanied by a table or Excel sheet detailing various deeds under scrutiny or completed, all linked to the same notary, concerning different banks. They include an internal reference code within the portal and identify the relevant party (the borrower).

Upon this request, the DPA conducted an investigation.","The DPA’s investigation regarding the roles assigned for the data management revealed the following.

To begin with, the banks operate as data controllers within the framework of outsourcing contracts which are accompanied by special data protection agreements.

Next, the banks designate ESpN as the processor under Article 28 GDPR. All processing activities carried out by ESpN regarding the portal are predetermined by banks and made available to notaries for mortgage procedures.

Additionally, the notaries use the PIGNA portal in the interest and on behalf of the respective bank. After receiving an assignment from the bank, ESpN creates an account for the notary and provides the notary with initial authentication credentials. The ESpN sends the credentials to the notary’s official e-mail address found on the professional register of Notaries.

In this phase, ESpN acts as a data controller for the creation and maintenance of the notary’s account, as well as linking it to the specific areas designated for use by each individual bank. For this reason, the ESpN provides the notaries with the privacy policy which is published on the PIGNA portal and where legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is identified as legal basis.

The DPA observed that ESpN, although not directly carrying out the identification of the notary availed itself of the identification carried out by a third party, i.e. the National Council of Notaries. This is because registration on PIGNA is carried out by using the e-mail address, assigned to the notary by the Council and published in the relevant register, which is collected by ESpN from the bank or directly from the Council. This reliance on third-party identification raised concerns because if ESpN lacks sufficient elements to guarantee the registrants' identity, it should conduct its own checks to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to PIGNA. Therefore, by not independently verifying the identity of registrants, ESpN risks breaching the principle of integrity outlined in Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR.

Moreover, the DPA found that relying on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as legal basis for processing notaries' data does not hold for the registration phase and generation of authentication credentials. The processing of personal data in this context should fall under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, namely a contractual relationship between ESpN and notaries. If the legal basis was legitimate interest, notaries would have a right to object. However, the right to object does not apply, as it would hinder the verification process of notaries' identities, necessary for accessing the portal. A contract between ESpN and notaries does not exist. Consequently, ESpN's handling of personal data related to notary registration and authentication credentials breached the principles of lawfulness and fairness.

Additionally, PIGNA sent a periodic report to notaries with with respect to all the banks including borrower's personal data. The DPA discovered that such processing was carried out by the ESpN in complete autonomy and outside the instructions received as per Article 28 GDPR from the banks which have never explicitly requested ESpN to send such reports. Further, ESpN privacy policy makes no mention of such periodic reporting.

It should be noted that pursuant to Article 28(10) GDPR, where a controller determines the purposes and means of the processing, he must be 'regarded as a controller of the processing in question'. Since ESpN lacked consent and failed to inform data subject of such processing, the DPA found a breach of the principles set out in Articles 5(1)(a) GPDR, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, Article 13 GDPR and Article 14 GDPR.

For reasons stated above the DPA determined fine for ESpN in the amount of €5,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 14, Article 32"
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a hospital had sent test results to its patients by SMS, including the patient's personal identification number. The DPA then asked the controller to explain the purpose of including personal identification numbers in text messages.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that its mobile service automatically sent test results, treatment instructions and a proposal for the next monitoring date to patients via SMS, for example, as follows: “[Patient ID]: [Test X] score is [Y] and everything is fine. Your next checkup is on [date]”. The controller stated that the inclusion of the personal identification number in the SMS ensured that the patient information was not inadvertently disclosed to the wrong persons with the same name.

The controller considered that in a service where the personal identification number is transmitted as a text message to the patient's own mobile phone, the risk related to the processing of the personal identification number is estimated to be low. On the other hand, if the SMS is targeted to the wrong person, the risks for the data subject can be considerably high.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA noted that the purpose of Section 29 of the Finnish Data Protection Act is to protect the personal identification number and to prevent its unnecessary processing. In addition, according to Section 29(4) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, the personal identification number should not be unnecessarily included in documents printed or created on the basis of a filing system. The DPA was of the opinion that SMS should be considered as such a document.

The DPA emphasised that, in accordance with Article 87 GDPR, member states may determine specific conditions for the processing of a national identification number and in that case, the national identification number shall be used only under appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The DPA noted that the personal identification number is a unique and virtually permanent identifier, the access to which by third parties may cause significant harm to the data subject, such as identity theft. Furthermore, the SMS messaging system does not provide for the encryption of message content or traffic data.

In light of this, the DPA considered that the inclusion of the personal identification number in the SMS does not in fact guarantee that the SMS is addressed to the right person. The DPA stated that the controller should not process personal identification numbers for the sole purpose of facilitating its operations. Therefore, the controller should not have unnecessarily included the personal identity number in the SMS.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, Article 25(2) GDPR and Section 29(4) of the Finnish Data Protection Act. As a result, and in accordance with Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to bring its processing operations into compliance with the aforementioned provisions.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 58, Article 87"
"The controller is the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration.

The Norwegian DPA (“Datatilsynet”) audited the controller to check whether the controller ensured confidentiality in the management system used to process personal data to provide services. The audit was limited to the technical and organisational measures related to access management, logs and log control under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR. The audit also checked whether the controller established an appropriate management system under Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24 GDPR.","The DPA found a number of breaches that showed structural and organisational weakness and a lack of management and understanding of the importance of data protection and the imposed requirements. The DPA identified 12 offences relating to the fact that the controller, having a large number of employees all over the country, lacked systematic control of employees’ use of the specialised systems.

The DPA found that the controller had organised itself in a way that a significant group of employees had broad access for official purposes. In combination with an inadequate system for log control, the DPA held that this was not compatible with the principle of confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and the requirements for organisational measures pursuant to Article 32 GDPR.

Moreover, the DPA found that no routine risk assessments were made and that therefore also the necessary “links” between risk level and access level were not routinely made. New ID administrators, who are in charge of granting accesses, received training that was very person-dependent and only described how accesses should be granted and not on what terms.

The DPA also found that employees had access to information about the entire population by default. Although the controller argued that it was for efficient case processing in order to provide good guidance and equal treatment and to process cases within a reasonable time, the DPA found that it was not in line with the confidentiality and the data minimisation principles (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR) and security requirements under Article 32(1) GDPR. The DPA held that there were other alternative options that would take into account both efficiency in case processing and the GDPR requirements to safeguard the data subjects' privacy through technical and organisational security measures.

Based on the findings of the audit, the DPA gave 3 orders to the controller:

(1) The DPA ordered the controller to establish a comprehensive and suitable system for organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 24 GDPR and Article 32 GDPR;

(2) the DPA ordered the controller to establish technical and organisational measures related to access management that provide satisfactory confidentiality protection of personal data under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32(1) GDPR;

(3) the DPA ordered the controller to establish technical and organisational measures related to log control that provide satisfactory confidentiality protection of personal data under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32(1) GDPR.

Therefore, the DPA imposed a fine of €1,720,425.16 (NOK 20,000,000) under Article 83 GDPR. The DPA took into account that the controller made special categories of personal data available for a long time and about a large number of people, without the necessary security mechanisms being established.  Moreover, the DPA also took into account that the previous orders issued by the DPA during audits and evaluations throughout the years did not proof to be sufficiently effective.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 83"
"The Worldcoin Foundation (the controller) used a phone application and in-person sites to engage in large-scale processing of biometric data, particularly irises, eyes and faces. The data was subsequently processed for various purposes including the creation of a digital identity profile (World ID).

On 10 August 2023, the Portuguese DPA (CNPD) initiated an investigation. The CNPD found that the controller had collected the biometric data of over 300,000 data subjects within Portugal. It noted in particular that the controller (1) collected biometric data of minors, (2) made it impossible to exercise the right to erasure of the collected data, (3) made it impossible to revoke consent, and (4) provided deficient information to data subjects.

The controller collected data initially through a phone application through which data subjects could create a World ID in order to use Worldcoin cryptocurrency. In order to ‘verify’ the World ID, data subjects were encouraged to visit the controller’s in-person stores so that a device called an ‘Orb’ could capture high-resolution images of their irises, eyes, and faces. The controller alleged that this ‘verification process’ was necessary to establish ‘proof of personhood’ and prevent duplication of World IDs. Orb operators were taught to encourage data subjects to consent to the storage and use of the biometric data. The controller offered tokens to encourage data subjects to provide their biometric data via the Orb, and offered financial rewards for them to invite others to have their biometric data collected.

In February and March 2024, the CNPD received reports from data subjects concerning mass collection of minors’ biometric information, the impossibility of exercising rights to erasure, and inadequate disclosure concerning risks of processing at the time of collection. The CNPD observed that there were no measures in place to verify data subjects’ ages. It noted that the controller’s consent forms expressly mentioned the impossibility of erasure and of revoking consent. Finally, it also considered that the declaration of consent was partially provided only in English.","The CNPD noted its competence to decide the case due to processing in the national territory pursuant to Article 56 GDPR. It concluded that the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a), 7(3), 9(1), and 13(2)(c), and 17(1) GDPR. It imposed a temporary ban on processing for three months pursuant to Article 58(2)(f) GDPR.

The CNPD found that the only possible basis for lawful processing under Article 9(2) GDPR in this case was consent. Given the nature of the data, the CNDP emphasized that consent must be ensured with greater care to guarantee that it is freely given, informed, unequivocal, and explicit. It concluded that this standard was not met in this case. The controller violated Articles 5(1)(a)and 13 GDPR by only making reference to documents without providing direct information on biometric data processing and by providing some information only in English. The CNDP thus concluded that there was insufficient information provided for the data subjects to freely consent to the processing of their biometric data. The CNPD further noted that transparency and consent concerns were exacerbated in the case of minors, who lack capacity to give consent.

The controller also violated Articles 7(3) and 17(1) GDPR because it made it impossible to exercise the right to erasure or to revoke consent.

Given the high risk to the fundamental right of data protection, the CNPD concluded that urgent intervention was justified. In particular, the known collection and processing of minors’ biometric data under nontransparent conditions, in exchange for currency, and without the possibility to erase the data or revoke consent increased the need for urgent action to prevent further violations. Further, these violations, the CNPD noted, would be difficult or impossible to remedy, and could not be prevented by less restrictive measures. The CNPD thus invoked its power to temporarily restrict processing pursuant to Article 58(2)(f) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 7, Article 9, Article 13, Article 17, Article 58"
"The controller, a housing association, installed 38 (active) video cameras and three dummy cameras at a residential complex after an increased number of break-ins in the basement. The cameras monitored the general areas, including entrance areas and bicycle/trash rooms. The apartment entrance doors and residents’ personal spaces were excluded from the cameras’ scope and/or rendered unrecognisable. The data subjects, the residents, were informed about this in a newsletter and on the notice board at the complex.

On 03 November 2022, the Austrian DPA (‘Datenschutzbehörde’) was anonymously informed about the video surveillance system. The DPA then conducted a data protection review in accordance with Article 57(1)(h) GDPR.

The controller argued that the video surveillance system was in the interest of protecting property against theft, damage, and other disruptions (in accordance with Austrian national law, Section 28 WEG) and preserving evidence thereof.  The recordings were stored for a maximum of 72 hours.

The controller further argued that although the data subjects had not given their consent, it was not necessary because the legitimate interest of the controller overrode the interests of the data subjects. The proper fulfilment of a contract was also present because the data subjects reported break-ins at the complex. The controller had an obligation to take preventative measures in order to avoid damage.","The DPA explained that under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and as reiterated by the CJEU, video surveillance operated to protect property is considered a legitimate interest. However, any data processing must comply with the principles for processing set out in Article 5(1) GDPR, particularly the principle of confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

As the controller argued, the controller was also fulfilling their contractual obligations in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. However, the DPA held that the data processing must, nevertheless, comply with the conditions prescribed in Article 5(1) GDPR. In particular, the DPA assessed whether these operations complied with the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. This principle sets out three requirements: adequacy, relevance and limitations to what is necessary. The DPA therefore examined whether the implemented video camera system is sufficient to achieve the purpose is the least intrusive means of achieving the purpose.

Regarding the recording of areas that cover the entrance, lift, staircase and corridor areas, the purpose of these video cameras is to keep strangers out of the building and have the additional purpose of preventing theft. However, the DPA noted that the first purpose was already achieved by the simultaneous installation of electronic access system. Regarding the additional purpose of preventing theft, the DPA found that this could be attained by restricting the recording area. Therefore, the DPA held that the cameras recording areas such entrance, elevator, stairs and corridors did not comply with the data minimisation principle. Moreover, the DPA held that when balancing the interests, the confidentiality interests of the data subjects prevailed due to the lack of necessity for the data processing in this case. The DPA found that the complete surveillance of the lift, staircase, corridor and entrance areas represents a disproportionately serious interference with the fundamental right to privacy of the data subjects and their visitors.

Regarding the monitoring garbage rooms, bicycle, and stroller storage rooms, the DPA found that the controller had a legitimate and justified interest in protecting the property of those responsible.

Regarding the cameras covering the garage entrance area, the DPA held that the controller pursued the legitimate interests of those responsible and third parties (i.e. other residents) who park in the garage.

The DPA concluded that the controller violated Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. The DPA found the processing of areas that cover the entrance, lift, staircase and corridor areas unlawful and therefore fully prohibited the monitoring. The DPA ordered the controller to limit the recording area of certain cameras within two weeks.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5
"At the end of 2021, the Hellenic DPA (HDPA) became aware of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum's (the controller) development and deployment of the ""Centaurus"" and ""Hyperion"" Programmes Closed Control Facility Centres for third country nationals on the Aegean islands (Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos). The HDPA also received requests for an investigation and opinion from the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament, as well as from civil society organisations, on the use of the systems in the asylum facilities.

The Centaurus project is reportedly an integrated digital system for the management of electronic and physical security around and within the facilities. The controller uses CCTV systems, artificial intelligence behavioral analytics (AI) algorithms and unmanned aerial vehicles to process images and personal data. The Hyperion programme is described as an integrated entry/exit control system, with the purpose of monitoring the entry and exit of the guests and certified members NGOs through the processing of personal data, in particular biometric data.

In response to the HDPA's request for explanations of the programmes and their data processing, the controller stated that the legal basis for the Centaurus project's video surveillance was the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority pursuant to Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. It argued that prior alternative protection measures, such as fencing of the property and patrols, were not as effective as video surveillance in dealing with illegal activities. With regard to the use of drone surveillance, the controller stated that they are only used in cases of emergency, such as fire or unrest. It claimed that the retention period of Centaurus system data is 15 days unless an incident is detected, in which case it is kept for up to 1-3 months  and that access to data subjects' data is restricted to authorised police users; if copies of footage need to be provided, persons are blurred so as to minimise data. Information was provided to data subjects with notifications and warning signs on CCTV systems. Further, anti-malware software, passwords, system maintenance and software-level security policies were cited as security measures.

In the case of the Hyperion programme, the controller seems to have argued that no biometric data was not used to identify data subjects, but nonetheless citing Article 6(1)(e) GDPR as the legal basis for such processing if it does occur. Where any processing of special categories of data (namely fingerprints and biometric data) occurred for identification purposes, the controller cited Article 9(2)(b), (c), (g) and (j) GDPR as its legal basis. In a later communication, it clarified that its primary legal basis in this regard was based on substantial public interest pursuant to Article 9(2)(g) GDPR. Regarding consent, data subjects entering the accommodation facility were prompted to fill out a personal data recording form which included a consent request. Finally, the controller noted that a partial Data Protection Impact Assessment was carried out for both the Centaurus and Hyperion programmes.

The controller also claimed that there was no processing of personal data by either programme that extracted special categories of data - as a result, it found that Article 9 GDPR did not apply.","The HDPA imposed a fine of € 175,000, concluding that the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1), 12, 13, 14, 15(e), 25, 30, 35, 58(1)(e).

First, the HDPA considered it ambiguous which and when legal bases may apply to the processing of data carried out by the 'Hyperion' and 'Centaurus' systems. In particular, the HDPA considered that Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is expressly excluded from provisions of the GDPR discussing processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions. It also observed that there was no specification of legal basis according to the category of data subjects (workers, vulnerable groups, minors, NGO workers, etc.). With regard to the processing of data, the HDPA found no evidence for the controller's claims that special categories of data were not processed. It considered that the Centaurus system's surveillance could process religious beliefs, racial or ethnic origin, or other special categories of data. It thus found that the controller should have articulated an appropriate legal basis for such processing under Article 9 GDPR.

Second, the HDPA also found a violation of the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1a) of the GDPR. It found that the information provided to the data subjects was inadequate, as it was clear from the file that the data subjects did not understand Greek or English. Thus, the information did not comply with transparency requirements in violation of Articles 12, 13, and 14 GDPR.

The HDPA also considered the controller's lack of cooperation. In particular, it noted that the controller failed to submit data protection contracts had been concluded with data processors because it claimed they were confidential. As a result, the HDPA found a violation of Articles 15(e) and 58(1)(e) GDPR, which permit supervisory authorities to obtain all information necessary for the performance of its tasks. The vague, incomplete, confusing and contradictory information provided also resulted in a violation of Article 31 GDPR.

Fourth, the HDPA noted the controllers failure to complete the record of activities prior to the start of the programmes. Accordingly, it found a violation of Article 30(1) GDPR.

Fifth, as noted by the controller, the data protection impact assessments were limited and was not carried out prior to the start of each processing operation. The HDPA thus found a violation of Article 35(1), (2) and (3) GDPR.  It also found that this failure to carry out a comprehensive and coherent data protection impact assessment by default and prior to processing violated Article 25(1) and (2) concerning data protection by design and default.

Finally, the HDPA noted that the interconnections of the systems with other government data systems were not explained and these potential risks were not assessed. Such failure to comply with the principle of accountability by not providing complete, accurate and clear information or adequately documenting the lawfulness processing constituted a violation of Article 31 GDPR.

The Greek DPA imposed a fine of € 175,000 for this violation and instructed the controller bring processing into compliance within 3 months.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 22, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 30, Article 31, Article 35, Article 37, Article 38, Article 39, Article 55, Article 83"
"An investigation was carried out by the Guardia di Finanza (financial police) in which fines were imposed on four companies and databases were confiscated as they related to illegally conducted telemarketing calls from 2015 to 2022. The calls aimed at promoting services of companies in the electricity and gas sector. One of these companies was Enel Energia ('the controller').

Further investigation of the databases revealed that Enel Energia acquired as many as 978 contracts from the four companies, even though the companies did directly not belong to Enel Energia's sales network. The agreements reached by these companies with potential customers were sent to the Enel Energia’s customer relationship management ('CRM') system, which actually concluded the contracts on behalf on Enel Energia.

An additional investigation was launched by the Italian DPA ('Garante'), which revealed that these marketing activities were carried out using illicitly acquired lists of customers which contained addresses, telephone numbers, municipality of customer residences, and the customer's relevant energy company. The four companies which were never officially designated by Enel nor any of its sales agencies as data processors, nor was Enel fully aware of these irregularities. However, the processing activities were performed on Enel's behalf and with economic profit for the latter.

The DPA investigated in particular the lack of security measures in the access to the CRM system. The Garante noted how it was extremely easy for external companies - even in lack of any direct contractual relationship with Enel - to obtain the credentials necessary to use the system and ""upload"" contracts in violation of the law.

As a response to the allegations made by the Garante, Enel Energia highlighted procedural irregularities. They contested the  proceedings, among other things, by claiming that the Garante infringed the principle of ne bis in idem as the objections overlapped with previous measures against Enel. In particular, the Tribunal of Rima by ruling No. 443/2021 had already annulled the Garante’s fine against Enel Energia.","The DPA found the following infringements.

Enel Energia violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR where it failed to carry out an adequate assessment of the risks connected to its CRM system and failed to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee the correct use of access credentials and avoid the sharing of credentials. The Garante stated that this allowed the introduction of contract proposals acquired by employees of the agencies not authorised to access and process personal data within Enel Energia's contractual system.

The Garante also held that Enel Energia violated Articles 5(2), 24(1) and 25 GDPR. These articles relate to the duties of accountability and privacy by design which were in this case breached for not effectively counteracting the improper conduct of those agencies that intended to procure contracts for Enel Energia. Enel Energia's inability to demonstrate an exercise of its powers and control over functionality and security of its systems, is thus evident.

Lastly, the Garante decided that Enel Energia violated Article 28 GDPR because the contracts it concluded with its sales agencies did not reflect the actual and accurate handling of personal data. These contracts did not include terms about the controller's responsibilities or ensured the sales agencies were eligible to conclude legal agreements with external parties. This led to the situation at hand, where unauthorized telemarketing companies illicitly accessed Enel's credentials and unlawfully processed personal data in favour of the company.

Regarding the Enel Energia’s argument concerning the breach of ne bis in idem procedure, the DPA highlighted the distinction between the previous measure taken by the Garante (No. 443) and the current objections raised against Enel Energia.

The previous measure covered a wide range of activities conducted by Enel Energia, including telemarketing without consent, violations of opposition register rules, delays in responding to data subject rights requests, among others. It also addressed Enel Energia's efforts to prevent the misuse of its services by customers. On the other hand, security measures and monitoring of critical events in the CRM were not part of the previous examination. In this sense, the Garante adopted corrective measures addressing a different violation.

As a result, the DPA imposed a fine in the amount of €79,107,101 making it the highest sanction ever imposed by the Italian DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32"
"HUBSIDE.STORE (“controller”) has stores in France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy. In France, the controller carried out canvassing campaigns by telephone and SMS from prospect files purchased from two main data brokers, in order to promote the products it sold. The French DPA (“CNIL”) carried out an inspection at the controller’s premises in order to verify compliance with the GDPR and French Data Protection Act.

During this inspection, the CNIL discovered that, regarding commercial prospecting by SMS, the controller carried out these operations using prospect files purchased from data suppliers. These data suppliers collected the data of the persons concerned via entry forms for online competitions, in order to enable their partners to use them in their commercial prospecting.

The CNIL indicated that the forms accessible on the websites of the data suppliers were similar: beneath the fields enabling the person to enter their contact details was a “VALIDATE”, “I VALIDATE” or “I ANSWER QUESTIONS TO APPLY” button. Above or below this button, a text specified that by clicking on the button, the data subject declares that they have read the controller’s privacy policy and accepts that the data collected will be used to send them offers from the company’s partners. Hyperlinks were provided to access the privacy policy and the list of partners concerned. At the end of the text, it specified that if the data subject wishes to continue without receiving offers from the controller’s partners, they can click on a link in the text (“click here”).

The CNIL also pointed out that the form contains a hypertext link to a nominative lust of partners and not to categories of partners. However, the list did not mention HUBSIDE.STORE.

The controller also provided the CNIL with recordings of canvassing calls that they sent to Belgium in order to promote its stores there. The CNIL found that during these calls, the data subjects were only informed that the call had been recorded and that they could register with Bloctel.

The CNIL issued a decision regarding the legal basis for the commercial prospecting by SMS, by telephone, concerning the information delivered to the data subjects, and finally regarding the security measures implemented by the controller.","Preliminarily, regarding the cooperation mechanism, the CNIL considered that although the commercial canvassing operations were carried out exclusively from France, targeting French nationals, the controller transmitted recordings of canvassing calls to Belgium in order to promote its stores there. The CNIL added that the controller’s customer database contained all the customer data for HUBSIDE.STORE in Europe. Therefore, the CNIL found that the controller carried out cross-border processing and communicated the relevant information to the supervisory authorities concerned under Article 60(3) GDPR. None of the authorities raised any relevant and reasoned objection to the draft decision sent. Thus, under Article 60(6) GDPR they were deemed to have approved it.

Firstly, regarding the obligation to obtain consent from data subjects for commercial prospecting by electronic means (SMS), French national law, in particular Article L. 34-5 of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code (“CPCE”) establishes that consent is necessary for commercial prospecting by electronic means. Read in conjunction with Article 4(11) GDPR, an organization carrying out commercial canvassing by electronic means must collect the unambiguous, specific, free and informed consent of the data subject.

The CNIL added that that the forms used by the data suppliers did not allow data subjects to express a valid choice reflecting their preferences regarding the transmission of data for commercial prospecting purposes. The DPA found that the “VALIDATE”, “I VALIDATE” or “I ANSWER QUESTIONS TO APPLY’ button was highlighted by their size and color, which made it stand out from other information provided. The CNIL pointed out that the text used suggested the conclusion of the data subject’s journey rather than the transmission of data to partners. The location of the button also gave the impression that it must be clicked to complete the registration and take part in the competition.

On the other hand, the hypertext link which enabled data subjects to take part in the game without agreeing to the transmission of their data to partners was presented in the body of the text and in characters of a much smaller size. Therefore, it did not appear intuitive that it was possible to take part in the competition without clicking on one of the aforementioned buttons. Thus, the CNIL considered that the consent obtained was not unambiguous and free, violating Article L.34-5 CPCE and Article 4 GDPR.

Secondly, regarding the legal basis for the telephone canvassing, the CNIL considered legitimate interest and consent. On legitimate interest, the CNIL indicated that non-electronic commercial canvassing may be carried out in the basis of the controller’s legitimate interest if the processing does not infringe the rights and interests of the data subject. The controller must also take into account their reasonable expectations.

In the present case, the controller considered that the competition forms used did not enable the data subject to reasonably expect to receive commercial prospecting offers. The CNIL held that as the controller did not appear on the nominative list of partners to which the hyperlink in the form sent to, this exceeded the reasonable expectations of the data subjects. Therefore, the controller could not rely on legitimate interest.

On consent, the CNIL found that the forms implemented by the data suppliers did not enable valid consent to be obtained. Therefore, the CNIL considered that the controller did not obtain valid consent, and that there was no legal basis to the commercial canvassing operations by telephone.

Thirdly, regarding transparent information, the CNIL considered that in the present case, Article 14 GDPR applied to the controller as the data has not been collected by the controller itself. The CNIL held that the controller did not provide all the information required by Article 14 GDPR and did not offer the possibility to the data subject to obtain more complete information. Thus, the CNIL concluded that there was a breach of Article 14 GDPR.

Finally, regarding the security of processing, the CNIL indicated that under Article 32 GDPR, the controller must implement appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of data and prevent it from being processed unlawfully. The CNIL noted that the controller kept its customers’ personal data after the end of the contractual relationship without any intermediate archiving measures. However, the DPA decided that nothing established that persons would have access to said data without having a need to know. Therefore, the CNIL indicated that there was no breach of Article 32 GDPR.

The CNIL imposed a total fine of €525,000 on the controller: €200,000 for the infringement of Article L. 34-5 CPCE and €325,000 for the violation of Articles 6 and 14 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6, Article 14"
"A public middle school (the controller) had four cameras on its property: one in front of the school entrance, one in front of a computer space, one in front of the teacher’s lounge and management area, and one near the escape stairs. According to the controller, the purpose of the video surveillance was to protect persons from theft or attacks. The use of video cameras is signaled at the school's entrance. The controller maintained video records for 48 hours.

In response to the Austrian DPA's (DSB) investigation, the controller noted that preventing pupils from being endangered by other pupils during school is part of the duty of supervision assigned to teachers and schools. It relied on legitimate interests as a legal basis pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process personal data via the video surveillance cameras. The controller cited a DSB ruling that video surveillance of public bodies in the context of private sector activities for the purpose of self-protection or responsibility may be permissible even without express legal authorisation if carried out in response to specific dangerous situations and consistent with the principle of proportionality. As such, it argued that the use of technical surveillance measures in this context were authorised under national law (§ 1 para. 2 DSG).","The DSB concluded that video surveillance in the school was impermissible during hours of operation, ordering a restriction on processing from all cameras during school hours.

The DSB distinguished between the controller's behavior during school hours and outside of school hours. During school hours, the controller is behaving as a public entity. As a result, the controller cannot rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for its usage of video surveillance during school hours. The DSB thus ordered that no recordings be taken by any of the cameras during school operations, or else that the cameras be decommissioned.

On the other hand, the DSB considered that when the controller was using video surveillance outside of school hours for the purpose of protection of property, it was behaving in a private function. As a result, processing via video surveillance could be based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR when limited to the period outside of school operations.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 6
"On 7 December 2022, a data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD against Caixabank (the controller). The controller required new clients to sign a contract for provision of services, which included a clause stating that data subjects consent to their data being requested from the General Treasury of Social Security. For existing clients, the same clause was included in a declaration or modification contract. The provision cited Law 10/2010, a Spanish law on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, stating that it required the collection of such data. For both new and existing clients, the contract did not give an option to refuse consent – instead, consent was pre-established by the clause. 3,026,247 new clients signed the contract, and 3,401,052 existing clients signed the modification contract.

The data subject claimed that, after they expressed their disagreement, the controller stated that failure to sign the form with these clauses would result in the bank account being blocked.

On 30 January 2023, the AEPD informed the controller of the complaint. In its defense brief, the controller stated that it is required by Law 10/2010. In particular, it pointed to Article 11, which obliges financial institutions to guarantee that they are engaging with professional or business activities of the client. The controller interpreted this to mean that the identification of the client was necessary, as well as the collection of information concerning the client’s professional or business activities.","The AEPD concluded that consent was improperly obtained in this case and the controller thus lacked a legal basis for processing. The AEPD proposed a fine of €2,000,000. The controller acknowledged responsibility of the violations and paid a portion of proposed fine; thus, the fine was reduced 40% to €1,200,000.

The AEPD acknowledged that Law 10/2010 requires banks to verify professional and business activities of its clients. However, it noted that the law does not specify how a bank is to assess this data; instead, the controller decides on the form of verification, and it should do so in a way that complies with data protection regulations. The Convention established between the General Treasury for Social Security and the Spanish Association of Financial Entities, which guides financial institutions on compliance with Law 10/2010, also does not establish an obligation to verify personal data with the General Treasury of Social Security.

There was thus no legal obligation requiring the controller to collect its clients’ personal data from the General Treasury of Social Security. However, insofar as this was the method chosen by a controller to comply with Law 10/2010, the AEPD noted that the sixth clause of Annex III of the Convention explicitly requires data subject consent in order for the controller to verify their personal data with the General Treasury of Social Security.

The AEPD found that consent was not properly obtained in this case. As a result, the controller lacked a legal basis for processing pursuant to Article 6(1) GDPR. The AEPD emphasized that consent is not free when the data subject cannot refuse consent without suffering any damage, or when the fulfillment of a contract or provision of service is dependent on consent even when it is not necessary for the service. In this case, consent was not free because it was included as a non-negotiable aspect of the controller’s contract. Additionally, the controller failed to obtain specific consent in each case where data was being processed for different purposes -- instead, it combined consent to processing for the provision of banking services with consent to processing of the data subject’s data from the General Treasury of Social Security. Finally, consent was not informed because it was presented as a requirement rather than an option within the contract, and because the clause falsely stated that the controller was obligated to process the personal data under national law.

Given these violations, the AEPD resolved to initiate sanction proceedings against the controller and recommended a sanction of € 2,000,000.

Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €1,200,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 6"
"On 15 March 2022, I-DE Redes Eléctricas Inteligentes, S.A.U. (the controller) detected an attack on its GEA management portal (GEA portal), which is a web portal that manages service connections between the electric distribution network. At that point, the controller had yet to detect any effect on personal data.

The following day (16 March), a brute force attack was made against the same webpage, resulting in a general slowdown. The controller adopted security measures in order to repel the attack. The controller analysed the attack’s activity and concluded that it has extracted the personal data of 1.35 million clients. The breached data included names, surnames, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, national identification card numbers and client codes. On 18 March 2022, the controller notified the breach to the AEPD.

The controller is Iberdrola's energy distribution brand. Spanish law concerning the electricity sector requires that regulated activities (such as distribution of electricity) and unregulated activities (such as marketing) be unbundled. In accordance with such law, the controller stated that it could only access the personal data of users of its electric service. It thus claims that it does not have access to the data of data subjects managed by other distribution companies.

Despite this separation, the controller communicated the breach to other companies of the Iberdrola group on 28 March 2022, noting that it could have affected information referring to clients of these companies. The controller included internal codes corresponding to the affected clients so that the companies could verify if those clients’ data had been compromised. Two companies, Iberdrola Clientes, S.A. and Curenergía Comercializador de Ultimo Recurso SA, subsequently reported to the AEPD that personal data of 92,550 and 1,515,000 clients was affected, respectively. Due to the numerous companies affected, the AEPD initiated investigations into four entities.

The controller requested that its case be joined with the AEPD’s investigation of Iberdrola (EXP202305587). It noted that the attack on its GEA portal was the common security incident that prompted both cases. With regard to the data breach and its security measures, the controller stated that had adopted the totality of security measures established by Iberdrola. It also argued that there had been no harm to the data subjects as a result of the breach.","The AEPD found that the controller violated Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR, imposing a fine of €3,500,000.

It began by rejecting the controller’s request for joinder, finding that even though there was a common security incident, the cases involve distinct breaches of different sets of personal data.

With regard to the violation of Article 32 GDPR, the AEPD considered that the vulnerability resulting in the data breach was foreseeable and avoidable. The controller failed to carry out an appropriate assessment of the risks of harms to data subjects that were inherent in its processing, and it did not account for risks to confidentiality, availability or integrity of the data. Furthermore, the AEPD noted that there were vulnerabilities in the portal that could have been detected prior to the cyberattack, including an inadequate password policy and a failure to limit access to the portal from suspicious IP addresses. The precise details of the vulnerabilities are redacted in the decision, but the AEPD noted that the shortcomings were exploited in the cyberattack and resulted in the breach. It further stated that the vulnerability could have been identified in security assessments, but that the controller had not conducted a security review of its critical applications since 2019 – over two years before the incident. Due to the shortcomings in security measures that resulted in oversights of the GEA portal’s vulnerabilities, the AEPD found the controller violated Article 32 GDPR.

The AEPD also found that the controller violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. It focused in particular on the failure to protect confidentiality of the personal data affected. In addition to lacking the security measures discussed above, the controller also did not have technical measures in place, such as pseudonymisation, that corresponded to the detail of the personal data it was regularly processing. The AEPD rejected the argument that none of the data subjects were adversely affected by the breach, emphasizing that the loss of confidentiality is, in of itself, a harm to the fundamental right to data protection.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"The Hellenic Data Protection Authority undertook an investigation following numerous complaints regarding unsolicited spam calls originating from companies acting as call centres (hereinafter “processor”) on behalf of ELPEDISON A.E. (hereinafter ""controller""), aimed at promoting the controller's products and services. In Greece, individuals have the option to register under Article 11 of Greek Law 3471/2006 (hereinafter ""register-list"") to opt out of unsolicited communications. During the investigation, complaints that did not meet validity criteria (e.g., complainants not registered on the register-list or failing to raise objections under [[Article 21 GDPR|Article 21 GDPR]]) were rejected by the HDPA. The remaining 40 potentially valid complaints, two of which were still under investigation, were categorised into four categories. Category A: six complaints where the controller acknowledged a violation might had occurred. Category B: three complaints where the controller disputed the occurrence of a violation. Category C: twenty-nine complaints where the controller claimed to had fulfilled its obligation but the processor failed. Therefore, in addition to the controller, the investigation was extended to include five processors. These processors included BEFON (3 complaints), Call Experts (11 complaints), Televise (1 complaint), Zitatel (8 complaints), and Plegmanet (7 complaints). Category D: two complaints that were still under investigation at the time.

The controller had failed in many cases to provide a correct, up-to-date register-list on time, pointing out the complex process that involves receiving the register-list from various providers, which it then needs to combine and send to the processors. The processor pointed out that delays in the register-list update were due to the 11 million phone numbers that required reformatting before they could be imported and the long time required to upload them into the relevant systems. Both the controller and its processors blame human and systemic errors, claiming they were isolated incidents and not intentional.","The Hellenic DPA noted that Article 11, Paragraph 1 of Greek Law 3471/2006, the automated unsolicited electronic communications for direct marketing or advertising purposes is only permissible if the recipient has given explicit prior consent and Paragraph 2 specifies that unsolicited communications involving human intervention for such purposes are prohibited if the recipient is listed on the opt-out register-list of the provider. Advertisers conducting telephone promotions with human intervention are required to obtain an updated register-list from all providers to exclude those who have opted out. Additionally, according to Article 4(1) GDPR and the opinion 4/2007 of the Article 29 Working Party of the EU, a person's telephone number constitutes personal data, as it can be an be an indirect identifier of the data subject. And lastly, it should also be noted that under [[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]], both the controller and the processor have an obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security against risks.

The Hellenic DPA found that the controller had breached Article 11 of Greek Law 3471/2006 In six cases, alongside violations of [[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]], this is this is attributable to the absence of sufficient security measures to oversee the data processed by processors. Call Experts was found in violation of [[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]] in ten cases due to inadequate security measures. Similarly, Plegma Net was found to be in violation of [[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]] in ten cases. Meanwhile, Zitatel was found to be in violation of Article 5(1) GDPR and [[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]] in two cases.

For these reasons, the Hellenic DPA:
A) imposed a fine of €127,709 on Elpedison the “controller” for violation of [[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]] and instructed the controller to, within six months, develop a procedure for monitoring call centre companies. This procedure should involve conducting comprehensive or random checks on a significant volume of outgoing calls from each collaborating company at least once a year.
B) imposed a fine of €10,000 on Call Experts the “processor” for violation of [[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]] and imposed a prohibition on keeping an internal register-list of objections.
C) imposed a fine of total €11,000 on ΣΤ & Σια Ε.Ε. (Zitatel) the “processors”, fine of €6,000 imposed for violation of [[Article 32 GDPR|Article 32 GDPR]] and a fine of €5,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. Additionally instructed the erasure of personal data obtained by Zitatel as controller from the website https://fthinorevma.gr for the purpose of promoting products and services of Elpedison.

"The Finnish DPA was notified that Jamk University of Applied Sciences (the controller) unnecessarily processed the location data of its employees. The DPA then asked the controller to explain the purpose for which it processed the location data of its employees.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it used a third-party mobile application that allowed remote employees to record their working hours. The controller explained that the use of the app also required location data to be enabled by default. The controller emphasised that it did not actively use the location data, but only processed it for system technical reasons.

The controller also stated that the use of the app was voluntary. If the employee had chosen to use the app, the processing was based on the data subject's consent. The controller noted that the use of the app was also in compliance with [https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20040759#L2P3 Section 3 of the Finnish Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life], according to which the employer may only process personal data that is directly necessary for the employee's employment relationship.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the mere fact that the app does not allow the recording of working hours without processing location data did not make the processing necessary. The DPA noted that it was possible to record working hours without processing location data. The DPA also emphasised that according to [https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20040759#L2P3 Section 3 of the Finnish Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life], no exceptions to the necessity requirement can be made, even with the consent of the employee.

The DPA found that consent does not override the necessity requirement under the Finnish Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life. Therefore, the data subject's consent cannot serve as a legal basis for collecting unnecessary personal data. Since there was no legal basis to process the employees' location data, the controller processed the personal data in violation of the principles of lawfulness and data minimisation.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated [[Article 5 GDPR#1a|Article 5(1)(a) GDPR]], [[Article 5 GDPR#1c|Article 5(1)(c) GDPR]], [[Article 6 GDPR]] and [https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20040759#L2P3 Section 3 of the Finnish Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life]. As a result, and in accordance with [[Article 58 GDPR#2f|Article 58(2)(f) GDPR]], the DPA imposed a ban on processing on the controller, covering all processing related to location data that is or has been collected with the app.

In addition to the ban on processing, the Sanctions Board of the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €25,000 on the controller in accordance with [[Article 83 GDPR]]. The fact that the main purpose of the controller's activities was not to make a profit, but to provide higher education in accordance with the law, was considered a mitigating factor that significantly reduced the amount of the fine.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 58, Article 83"
"Two controllers that offered gambling and betting activities online included cookie banners on their websites. The banners did not distinguish different purposes for processing, making a single request for consent. The controllers' privacy policies also lacked information about the legal basis for processing, the types of cookies used, the purpose of each cookie and the cookie storage periods. In addition, one of the controllers processed personal data prior to obtaining data subjects' consent.","The Croatian DPA (AZOP) found that the controllers lacked a legal basis for processing in violation of Article 6(1) GDPR and failed to inform data subjects pursuant to Article 13 GDPR. In addition, one of the controllers violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR after it began processing data before obtaining consent from data subjects. The AZOP imposed fines of €15,000 and €20,000, respectively, on the controllers.

Where processing is based on consent and has multiple purposes, cookie banners must indicate the purposes in a clear and understandable manner. They also must clearly distinguish the purposes from each other. In this case, the controllers did not distinguish different purposes for processing in obtaining user consent. Such consent, the AZOP found, did not meet the GDPR's requirements. As a result, consent was not a valid legal basis in this case and the controllers violated Article 6(1) GDPR.

The AZOP also found that the controllers failed to properly inform data subjects of the processing pursuant to Article 13(1) and (2) GDPR. In particular, their privacy policies did not contain information about the legal basis for processing, types of cookies, purpose of each cookie or cookie storage period.

Finally, the AZOP also noted that one of the controllers was processing personal data from the moment that the data subject opened the webpage even though it had not yet obtained consent. It considered this a violation of the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13"
"The Swedish DPA (""IMY"") initiated an investigation against Expressen Lifestyle AB (""the controller"") on 2019 to check whether consent was obtained in compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR.

Following the implementation of the GDPR in 2018, the controller reassessed its legal basis for processing personal data, and started relying mainly on contractual necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR instead of consent when subscribing for the controller's magazine. However, the controller accidentally missed updating the registration form of one of the company's webshop, Magasinshoppen. The webshop had a checkbox on its webpage along with the text ""I accept the subscription terms. By doing so, I consent to the processing of personal data within the Bonnier Group."" The controller also did not update the subscription terms which stated: “When ordering, you agree that your personal data, including email address, mobile phone number for calls and text messages and any other digital addresses, may be stored and used within Bonnier for digital services, marketing, and for statistical and analytical purposes."" Furthermore, information was provided on the the right to withdraw consent.

After the DPA's inspection began, the controller took immediate action to correct the information provided in their webshop's registration process. Now, instead of being presented with either a consent request or consent information text, the data subject is asked to agree to the subscription terms (i.e. the terms of purchase) and to confirm to have read the controller’s data protection policy.","When collecting personal data from a data subject, the controller is obliged under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR to provide information regarding the legal bases of the processing. Article 12(1) GDPR requires the controller to take steps to provide this information to the data subject in a concise, clear, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. The DPA held that the text next to the tick box of the controller’s website gave the data subject the impression that the controller’s legal basis for processing personal data was consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. This was reinforced by the text on the subscription terms and the provided information on the right to withdraw consent. As the controller did not base its processing on consent but on the legal grounds of contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR) and legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR), the DPA found that the controller violated Article 13(1)(c) GDPR by indicating an incorrect legal basis.

The DPA found that the violations were a minor infringement pursuant to Recital 148, because the website was not the main website that was used by the data subjects to subscribe to the controller and thus the affected data subjects were limited and the violation did not result in serious consequences to the data subjects, Moreover, the DPA recognised that it was a mistake of the controller to not update the website after reviewing its procedures. The DPA also took into account that the controller took immediate action to update the registration of its webshop after the DPA initiated supervision. Therefore, the DPA issued a reprimand under Article 58(2)(b) GDPR against the controller for violating Article 13(1)(c) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 13
"On 2 November 2022, a security breach occurred on Shanghai Moonton Technology Co. Ltd.’s (the controller) videogame forum. The controller is a Chinese videogame company headquartered in Shanghai that was acquired by Bytedance in March 2021.

The breach affected 442 Spanish data subjects and included usernames on the controller’s forum, user ID numbers, frequency of each data subject’s visit to the forum, the reported sex of data subjects, IP addresses, email addresses and the data subjects’ activities on the forum including publications and interactions. On the day of the breach, 2 November 2022, the personal data obtained in the breach was published on a third party website. The following day, 3 November 2022, a member of the controller’s security team identified the publication of the data on the third party website. From 4 November to 16 November 2022, the controller investigated the data breach. The controller identified the location of each data subject based on their IP address and notified the corresponding DPAs accordingly. It began notifying DPAs on 11 November 2022.

On 21 November 2022, the controller notified the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of thebreach.

In its investigation, the AEPD noted that the controller used moderators which were volunteers, not employees or contractors, in order to manage its forums. Moderators were hired using a two-week trial period and were required to abide by terms of service and a code of conduct. The controller gave moderators access to users’ personal data in order to monitor the forums and where necessary, revise or eliminate posts, block user access to the forum, respond to users or approve new users. This access included data which was available to all users on the forum including data subjects’ usernames, user IDs, number of visits to the forum, reported sex, and activities on the forum. In addition, moderators were given access to personal data which was not already publicly available to all forum users: data subjects’ email addresses, time and date of the most recent activity on the forum, and IP addresses.

The controller stated that it had security measures in place prior to the breach with regard to the affected data with the goal of avoiding such incidents. It was unaware of any prior security incidents and noted that it had not received any claim or request from data subjects in Spain in relation to the breach. With regard to the delay in notifying the AEPD of the breach, the controller argued that as it did not have a legal establishment in Spain, it needed to contract a legal assessor within Spain to prepare the due notification and documents.","The AEPD concluded that the controller likely violated Articles 5(1)(c), 5(1)(f), 27, 32 and 33 GDPR.

With regard to the data minimisation violation, the AEPD found that the controller shared more personal data of data subjects than necessary with forum moderators. It stated that it was not necessary to provide moderators access to all of this personal data – particularly email and IP addresses – in order to moderate the forums. These data were not relevant to the duties that the controller envisioned for the moderators.

The AEPD also determined that the controller failed to comply with security obligations. It stated that the publication of personal data from its forum on a third party website indicated a violation of integrity and confidentiality principles under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. The AEPD also took issue with the controller’s use of moderators – in essence, the controller permitted users who volunteered to moderate to access other users’ personal data. It employed no security measures beyond a code of conduct, terms and conditions and a two-week trial period. These measures, the AEPD found, were inadequate and violated Article 32 GDPR.

The AEPD also concluded that the controller had failed to designate a representative in the European Union. The controller is a Chinese videogame company offering services in the European Union, and was thus required to do so pursuant to Article 27 GDPR.

Finally, the AEPD found that the controller did not notify the AEPD of the breach within the time frame envisioned by Article 33 GDPR. The controller did not notify the DPA within 72 hours of learning of the breach, but instead took 18 days.

Given these violations, the AEPD resolved to initiate sanction proceedings against the controller and recommended a sanction of €90,000.

Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted for the latter option and reduced the fine by 20%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €72,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 27, Article 32, Article 33"
"On the night of 31 July 2021, a cyber-attack occurred in the healthcare system of the Lazio region, Italy. It had some serious repercussions causing local health authorities, hospitals and nursing homes ('the controllers') being unable to use regional information systems for hours and in some cases even for months. Essential services related to the emergency activities were not interrupted as they were separeted from other applications.

The ransomware attack originated in March 2021 on a computer of a regional employee working remotely for one of the entities. The employee installed a malicious software necessary to connect to the processor’s network. The software created a backdoor to the system stealing the employee’s access credentials.

LAZIOcrea S.p.a. was a company responsible for the management and security of the information systems of Lazio Region pursuant to Article 28 GDPR (‘processor’ or ‘company’). The attack targeted machines located in one of the rooms of the data center managed by the company. The company was therefore also acting as a controller for its own purposes, as the operating systems which were attacked also managed additional processing activities.

The company did not notify the data breach immediately but with considerable delay and in any case beyond 72 hours as required by Article 33 GDPR. The data breach was notified to the affected controllers about two weeks after the incident, lacking specific references to the attacked processing systems which would have been beneficial for each controller to delineate the extent of the breach and evaluate associated risks.

The notification of the data breach itself did not document necessary information about the attack such as, i.e. date and time of closure of the incident, date and time of resolution of the incident, person who detected the incident. Moreover, some of the information provided was inaccurate, i.e. description of the incident, the response actions carried out.

Due to this, the Italian DPA (‘Garante’) had to act ex officio following press reports regarding the facts in question and notifications presented by various data controllers involved. The investigation revealed that the company did not adopt several security measures.

Firstly, at the time of the incident, the company did not have staff dedicated to a 24-hour analysis of the alerts generated by Microsoft’s SIEM, the security monitoring system. Secondly, the company did not separate the networks for employee’s accounts and servers used for various processing operations carried out. Thirdly, although the filtering rules on the firewalls in the data center managed by the company were set up to target specific critical systems, they failed to stop the malware from spreading to around 180 systems. Fourthly, the attackers succeeded due to a vulnerable authentication procedure for remote system access, relying solely on username and password credentials and the company’s failure to update its operating system creating additional vulnerabilities.

It also emerged that the temporary unavailability of access to data processed through the mentioned healthcare facilities was, on the one hand, a direct consequence of the cyber-attack and, on the other hand, an indirect consequence of the subsequent actions by the company. In fact, the company decided to shut down all the server systems which disabled them from determining which ones were compromised. Additionally, given the absence of the system separation, it could not prevent further spread of the malware.

As part of its defence, the company represented that it performed annual internal audits based on the certification process of the Information Security Management System. The company also declared that prior to the accident, the system information security was implemented in compliance with the industry standards certification ISO/IEC 27001.","The investigations conducted by the Garante revealed a series of serious violations by the company. Firstly, the Garante determined that the company acted in the role of a controller of its own operating systems which were also a target of the cyber-attack. For this reason, it failed to fulfil its obligation under Article 33(1) GDPR to report the breach to the DPA within 72 hours since the moment it became aware of it. In addition to that, the DPA determined that as a processor, the company was obliged to report the incident to all the controllers affected by the breach as per Article 33(2) GDPR. The company failed to provide adequate justifications regarding the reasons for the above-mentioned delays. As a result, the DPA found a violation of Article 33 GDPR.

Secondly, the DPA noted that the company failed to adequately document the violation as the report contained incomplete information regarding the data breach and its handling. Such behavior was also not in line with the company's own data breach management policies which provide for the keeping of an events register on reports of alleged breaches. The DPA thus found a breach of obligations under Article 33(5) GDPR.

Thirdly, the lack of various security measures, such as assigning personnel for system security monitoring, separating operational networks, or reinforcing filtering rules on the firewalls within the data center, led to various vulnerabilities. Exploited by attackers, these vulnerabilities provided access to the company's operating systems which, as discovered after the attack, were outdated.

In this regard, the DPA highlighted that the processing operations carried out in this context require the adoption of the highest security standards. The company argued that its information security system is in compliance with the  ISO/IEC 27001 certification standards. However, the DPA noted that such certification is not, at the moment, among those envisaged by Article 42 GDPR. The certification can be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR obligations and show that an organization has identified and implemented certain security controls. However, it does not guarantee predefined security levels or measures. For these reasons, the Garante found a violation of the processing principle under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR related to the security of processing which was compromised by the company in its capacity as a controller and processor.

The DPA imposed a fine of a €271,000 to the company for the failure to report the data breach and a lack of security measures adopted to the processing operations conducted on such wide scale.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 33, Article 42"
"The Central Young Men’s Christian Association (the controller) offers a Positive Health Programme (Programme), which is an exercise scheme for people living with HIV. As part of the Programme, the Central YMCA collects special categories of data including referrals, dates of HIV diagnosis, medications taken, medical statistics, referring hospitals or clinicians and other medical history.

On 6 October 2022, a coordinator of the Programme sent an email to a mailing list of 270 recipients. The recipients were entered into the carbon copy (CC) function rather than the blind carbon copy (BCC) function, revealing the email addresses of all 270 recipients. The controller became aware of the breach the following day upon receiving complaints from affected data subjects. Upon realising the error, the coordinator attempted to unsend the email, but unintentionally sent a second email to all 270 recipients with the email addresses again entered in the CC function. Accounting for duplicates, 264 email addresses were disclosed in the breach, of which 115 had clear names and 51 had partial names that made them potentially identifiable. Thus, 166 data subjects were affected by the breach.

The controller reported the breach to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on 7 October 2022. On 10 October 2022, the controller notified the affected data subjects, took accountability of its error and informed data subjects of the steps it was taking.

At the time of the breach, the controller had a verbally communicated policy that the Programme staff should send event invitations using the BCC function. The controller had access to an email marketing tool which would permit for the sending of individual emails to each recipient, but it did not use this tool in sending emails relating to the Programme.

The controller waived its opportunity to respond to the ICO’s Notice of Intent and instead accepted the Notice and the ICO’s findings. It took remedial steps, conducting an audit of how external communications were being undertaken across the organisation and issuing new procedures to provide appropriate guidance on sending secure emails. The controller also updated its data protection training.","The ICO found that the controller violated Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 UK GDPR. It issued a monetary penalty of €8,730 (£7,500) as well as a reprimand. The ICO found that the breach resulted from serious deficiencies in the controller’s technical and organizational measures, demonstrating violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 UK GDPR.

First, the controller had access to an email marketing platform which would have reduced the likelihood of an inappropriate disclosure. However, it failed to use this tool for Programme emails even though it had the financial and organizational means to do so. The use of BCC sending instead was a high-risk method of sending emails due to human error. Given this risk, the ICO considered it irrelevant whether or not the policy requiring this practice was written down.

Second, the controller did not provide data protection training specific to employee roles or levels of access to personal data. In this case, the coordinator was a self-employed contractor. The controller’s policy had been to provide training only to employees, and the coordinator had thus not completed any data protection training. Even after the policy changed and training was extended to contractors, the coordinator was still not trained.

Third, the controller did not effectively monitor completion of data protection training. At the time of the investigation, 27% of the controller’s workers – including the coordinator who sent the incident email – had not completed the data protection training.

Finally, the controller’s data protection training was deficient. The ICO found considerable lack of awareness concerning data protection legislation within some parts of the organisation; for example, employees initially did not consider the breach a concern because the email contained no private information.

Initially, the ICO considered that a penalty of €349,000 (£300,000) would be appropriate to reflect the seriousness of the breach. However, taking into account the ICO’s action on previous cases and new policy on imposing monetary penalties, the ICO reduced the fine to €8,730. In calculating the penalty, the ICO took account of the controller’s four-day delay in notifying data subjects of the breach, negligence causing the infringement, remedial measures taken, responsibility of for the breach’s occurrence, lack of previous infringements, cooperation with the ICO and the high sensitivity of the data. Given that the emails were clearly directed at individuals with HIV, the ICO determined that the incident involved a special category of data or at the least carried a risk of inference that may be considered sensitive. It considered the violation serious due to the sensitivity of the personal data involved.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"The Italian Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) sent a notice to the DPA regarding possible existence of administrative violations related to Sigma s.r.l., a company which operates two Vodafone Italia S.p.A. sale points in northern Italy (‘Sigma or ‘controller’). The Financial Police carried out an investigation following a complaint by a customer of Vodafone who claimed that Sigma charged them on their credit card relating to an activation of a new contract for telephone services. The contract was concluded in the name of her deceased husband.

The investigation revealed that Sigma activated approximately 1,300 SIM cards, numerous telephone services under Vodafone brand and linked telephones to active users without their knowledge while they were made available for sale at the shop. Specifically, the company activated unsolicited services by inducing customers to sign, via a tablet, without clarifying the consequences of such consents. The company sold mobile phones without any request made by the customers that learned of the purchase by finding additional charges on their invoice. These services or devices were never delivered to the customers. Additionally, it emerged that Sigma used data of hundreds of users extracted from the Vodafone information systems.

Vodafone clarified that its relationship with Sigma is governed by a franchising contract according to which Sigma is a dealer acting as an autonomous controller of personal data related to SIM card and telephone service activations. Employees of Sigma were authorized to identify all customers and make a copy of their IDs in case of activation of a new product. Additionally, the data entry and activation of services was carried out by the employees through a computer connected to the Vodafone systems.

Consequently, circumventing the telephone operator’s controls and relevant processing provision amounted to a turnover of more than €80,000.","It emerged that Sigma planned its activities precisely with the intention to acquire unsolicited telephone contracts which could be used for further illegal activities.

The DPA confirmed that Sigma engaged in several activities which circumvented the relevant provisions on the processing of customer’s data and the agreement it concluded with Vodafone. Because of this circumvention, Sigma became a controller of the processing. According to Article 28(10) GDPR, in case a processor infringes the GDPR by determining the purposes and means of processing, the processor shall be considered a controller in respect of that processing.In particular, Sigma processed personal data of customers without their consent and charged them for the cost of purchase of services which were never requested nor delivered. For failing to provide the data subject with appropriate information and in a fair and transparent manner, Sigma was found in breach of Article 5(1)(a), (2) and Article 13 GDPR.

The DPA closely analysed the franchising contract which laid down specific rules for the identification of the person requesting a new SIM or telephone service activation. According to the DPA’s general measures of 16 February 2006, the operators (e.g. Vodafone) designate agents or dealers as data processors. However, for the purpose of activating the services they exercise real and autonomous decision-making power and therefore must fulfil the relevant obligations provided for by the GDPR. Sigma was a controller for the mentioned processing purposes and planned its activities precisely with the intention of using the personal database at its disposal to acquire unsolicited telephone contracts. For this reasons they were found in breach of the principle of lawfulness and accountability pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) and (2) GDPR and its responsibility as a controller under Article 24(1) and 25(1) GDPR. In addition to that, the data for the SIM and telephone service activation was collected without the customers’ knowledge and therefore Sigma lacked legal basis for this processing under Article 6 GDPR.

The DPA imposed a fine of €150,000 to Sigma and ordered the prohibition of further processing of customers’ data.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25"
"On 10 August 2022, a data subject notified 4Finance Spain Financial Services, S.A.U. (the controller) that they had received an unsolicited loan to their bank account with the controller. By 1 September 2022, the controller had received 10 more complaints of a similar nature from clients. The controller assessed the risk levels and severity of these breaches in August, September and November of the same year using an internal method based on European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) standards. Based on these assessments, the controller determined that it was not necessary to notify the violation to the AEPD or to affected parties.

Between 3 and 23 February 2023, the AEPD received various complaints from data subjects, who were clients of the controller, alleging similar unsolicited loans to their accounts. On 14 February 2023, the controller claimed to become aware of a data breach affecting personal data of its clients and employees. The breach ultimately affected 9636 data subjects and included names, birth dates, national identification numbers, foreigner identity numbers, passport or identification document numbers, payment data (such as banks and cards) and contact information.

The breach was a brute force attack that attempted different combinations of national identity numbers and emails with passwords. Once the attackers gained access to client accounts, they took out loans in the data subjects’ names, which the controller accepted and placed into client accounts. The hackers then contacted data subjects via WhatsApp, pretending to be the controller and requesting the refund of the amount to an account number controlled by the attackers. 139 of the affected data subjects were victims of this fraud.

The controller notified the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of the data breach on 17 February 2023. It expressed that it did not consider the breach to pose a high risk to the rights and liberties of affected data subjects and that it thus would not communicate the breach to them directly.

On 11 April 2023, the AEPD initiated an investigation against the controller and ordered the controller to communicate the breach to data subjects, which the controller did on the same day.

In response to the breach, the controller registered the breach in the register of incidents, filed a police report, circulated a communication to clients noting that it did not communicate with clients via Whatsapp, reset certain user passwords and amended its password policy to require more complexity and implemented two-factor authentication.","The AEPD found likely violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR and recommended a €600,000 fine. The controller acknowledged its fault and paid a reduced fine of €340,000 in accordance with national law.

In finding a likely violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, the AEPD focused on the sensitive nature of the data, the method of attack and the number of affected data subjects. The types of personal data acquired in the breach, including data subjects’ contact information as well as their financial information and history, amplified the security risks. Such combinations of data, the AEPD noted, could be used to construct detailed financial profiles of data subjects that make them more vulnerable to identity theft, fraud and other cyberattacks – such as in this case, where attackers were able to contact data subjects after manipulating their finances.

Due to the controller’s inadequate risk assessments and security measures, the AEPD also found a probable infraction of Article 32 GDPR. The AEPD noted that the controller’s handling of financial data and identification information is sensitive and thus obliges greater caution in implementing security measures. It thus considered the lack of a two-factor authentication prior to requesting a loan a serious oversight that facilitated the breach. Though it commended the controller’s adoption of mitigating measures including two-factor authentication after the breach, the AEPD found that these changes emphasised the shortcomings in its prior security system. Even after the controller was made aware of the risks by client complaints and internal risk assessments, it failed to adequately estimate the severity of the data breach. The inadequacy of the controller’s risk assessment was further demonstrated by its failure to communicate the incident to affected data subjects until ordered to do so by the AEPD.

Given these likely violations, the AEPD resolved to initiate sanction proceedings against the controller and recommended a sanction of €600,000. Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €360,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"Seven hotels, catering services and shops used video surveillance without marking the area under surveillance in a manner that was visible when entering the recording perimeter.","The Croatian DPA (AZOP) found that the controllers failed to notify data subjects that the surveilled area was under video surveillance, to provide data subjects information about the data controller or to give data subjects contact information pertaining to the controller so that they could exercise their rights. As result, it found that the controllers violated Article 13 GDPR and imposed violations ranging between  €500 and €4,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 13, Article 27"
"On 22 April 2024, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) initiated sanctioning procedures against Watium S.L. (the controller). As part of its investigation, the AEPD twice requested the controller to provide information related to the complaint filed against it. The requests were received by the controller on 23 November 2023 and 9 February 2024 respectively.

On 21 February 2024, the controller requested that the period for providing the documents and information be extended to 29 February 2024. Despite this request, the controller did not respond to the AEPD with the requested information.","Article 58(1)(e) GDPR empowers DPAs to order controllers to facilitate information in order for DPAs to conduct their investigation. The failure to comply with such requests for information can be sanctioned Article 83(5)(e) GDPR.

Given these likely violations, the AEPD resolved to initiate sanction proceedings against the controller and recommended a sanction of €160,000. In calculating the fine, the AEPD noted that this was a grave infraction warranting a high sanction. It also took account of the large size of the controller, aiming for the fine to be dissuasive and proportionate.

Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €96,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 58
"The Rome Chamber of Commerce (‘the Chamber’ or ‘controller’) notified the DPA that it was a victim of a cyber-attack. The attack resulted in the manipulation of their application’s database of users. The purpose was to load malicious files which then enabled remote access to the system. The controller learned about the attack through the publication of an anonymous tweet mentioning the Chamber and denouncing the attack on its website.

Subsequently, Innova Camara - the processor in charge of the management of the Chamber’s website - was informed of a link to a CSV file from where it was possible to download a list of 22,300 users. The personal data affected included names, surname, tax codes, e-mail address, landline or telephone numbers, and access and identification data.

The DPA’s investigation of the notified personal data breach revealed several vulnerabilities in the processor’s security measures.

Firstly, the concerned personal data was not found on the institutional website but in a database consisting of a backup copy of the appointment management system instead. The backup was created during a system upgrade. However, it was not delete after the period necessary to verify the functioning of the system. The controller acknowledged that this copy was supposed to be deleted earlier as the work on the system update was nearing completion. However, due to the health emergency at that time, the controller had to reschedule all priorities in order to render services to users.

Secondly, the passwords of users registered in the appointment management system were stored in a file which was the object of the cyber-attack. The file was protected by the MD5 encryption algorithm which, according to the DPA, is not cryptographically robust.","The DPA's decision adopted in the case at issue concerns the processor.

The DPA first recalled that under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR, personal data undergoing processing must be kept in an identifiable form only as long as necessary for the purposes it is processed. Following the upgrade of the system, the backup copy containing the personal data of more than 22,000 users was still present in the system. The controller itself confirmed that it was no longer necessary to store the personal data relating to the appointment management service. Therefore, the violation of the principle of storage limitation was found.

Moreover, based on the identified vulnerabilities if the system’s security measures, the DPA found a violation of principle of integrity and confidentiality and of the security obligations under Articles 5(1(f) and 32 GDPR. It stated that in the present case, the password encryption was not cryptographically robust and effective for these purposes. In fact, serious vulnerabilities of the MD5 algorithm have been known for several years that make it possible to trace back the passwords it generated.

In addition to the serious weaknesses, the DPA underlined that it is not sufficient to set up the security measures when the service is designed. The controller should also conduct the assessment of the adequacy of these measures. In fact, Article 32(1) GDPR expressly identifies, among other things, encryption as a suitable security measuring and requires that the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures adopted are regularly assessed.

The DPA noted that because of the common habit of many users to reuse the same password for different online services or to use a similar password, account must be taken of the high risks presented arising from unauthorised access to them. Therefore, the controller should have continually carried out the assessment of the adequacy of the measures adopted over time, also in the light of technological development.

In light of this, the DPA found that the processor violated Article 5(1)(e), (1)(f) and Article 32 GDPR. For these violations, the processor was fined €25,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"A data subject submitted a deletion request against a controller. The controller confirmed receipt and fulfillment of the request. However, the data subject continued to receive unsolicited marketing via SMS messages from the controller. Consequently, the data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, which opened an investigation of the controller.","First, the DPA found that the controller did not fulfil the data subject's deletion request and continued to send marketing communications via SMS, in breach of Articles 17 and 21(3) GDPR. This breach was sanctioned with a fine of approximately €1,000 (RON 4,976.3).

Second, the DPA considered that the controller could not demonstrate obtaining consent before sending marketing communications, in breach of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b) and Article 6(1) GDPR. This breach was also sanctioned with a fine of approximately €1,000 (RON 4,976.3).

Third, the controller did not respond to other data subject deletion and access requests, which were submitted by the same individual via email, in breach of Articles 15(1) and 12 GDPR. The controller received a warning for this breach.

Finally, the DPA requested the controller to adopt consent procedures that ensure the collection of prior, explicit consent before processing personal data for direct marketing purposes. It also requested the controller to adopt data subject rights procedures that enable more efficient and timely responses to such requests and to train its personnel on how to handle these requests.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17, Article 21"
"The controller did not display the name and identity of the controller responsible for processing the personal data on its website. Cookies, which were not technically necessary for the functioning of the website, were also installed on the data subjects’ device before they could give consent.","First, Article 13(1)(a) GDPR establishes that when the controller collects personal data from the data subject, it must inform the data subject of the identity and contact details of the controller. In the present case, the DPA discovered that the controller did not display the name and identity of the controller. Therefore, the DPA found a breach of Article 13(1)(a) GDPR.

Second, Article 4(5) of the Legea nr. 506/2004 ('Law 506/2004'), storing or obtaining access to information stored on a user’s terminal equipment is only permitted if the user has been provided with clear and complete information before giving consent. The DPA considered that the controller installed cookies on the data subject’s device before the latter gave consent. Therefore, the DPA found a breach of Article 4(5) of Law 506/2004.

The DPA therefore issued a €2,010 (RON 10,000) fine against the controller. The DPA also ordered the controller to complete its privacy policy with the necessary information provided for in Article 13(1)(a) GDPR and reconfigure the way cookies are installed on the users’ devices in order to comply with Article 4(5) Law 506/2004.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 13
"On 19 January 2024, the DPA carried out an inspection on the website grosauto.lv, which is operated by SIA GZ AUTO (‘controller’), a company that provided car services. Once the website was visited, a cookie banner appeared with the following text: ‘This website uses cookies to optimize its performance. By continuing to use this website, you agree to the use of cookies. Read more.’ Thus, it appears that visitors are not able to provide consent other way than just continuing to use the website.

When the DPA visited the controller’s e-shop they were taken to another website called detalas.lv. At the bottom of the page a cookie banner appeared with a similar text as on the previous website saying: ‘We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website. By continuing to use this website or by staying on the page, you agree to our use of Cookies. Continue.’ Once they clicked on the ‘Use of cookies’ they were provided with information that the website collected analytical cookies and indicated that as a visitor they could turn off cookies based on the browser they were using. By clicking on ‘Continue’, the banner window disappeared.

Additionally, the website contained a ‘Privacy Policy’ which specified the possibility to withdraw consent in cases where customers’ personal data are processed by SIA GZ AUTO on the basis of customer’s consent.

However, it emerged that the controller used analytical ‘_ga’ cookies (used by Google), marketing ‘_fbp’ cookies (used by Facebook) and necessary cookies from the moment the website was opened – before the consent was provided","According to the DPA, the storage of analytical and advertising cookies on the visitors’ end devices was carried out without the legal basis laid down in Article 6(1) GDPR, i.e. without the data subject’s informed consent. Despite the information on the provision of consent and the possibility to withdraw it in the Privacy Policy of the controller, in practice this option did not exist. In fact, the controller must obtain the data subject’s free and informed consent before any other action is taken on the website, including the online store detalas.lv in accordance with Article 7 GDPR.

On this basis, the DPA reprimanded the controller for an infringement of Article 5(1)(a), Article 6(1) and Article 7 GDPR. The controller was ordered to make necessary changes to its website to ensure that the use of cookies complies with the requirements of the GDPR, in particular to ensure an adequate ‘consent mechanism’.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7"
"On 28 February 2024, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) shared information concerning two new products that Meta (the controller) planned to launch for Facebook and Instagram between 30 May and 9 June 2024. The tools were Election Day Information (EDI) and Voter Information Unit (VIU), both of which would send notifications to all eligible Instagram and Facebook users in the EU to remind them to vote in EU Parliament elections. The functionalities required users to input personal data including their name, IP address, age and gender.

The controller claimed that the products aimed to ensure that all Facebook and Instagram users who are eligible to vote see the EDI and VIU features. It argued that its legal basis for processing was the necessity of executing its contract with users.

On 22 April 2024, the AEPD sent the DPC a questionnaire concerning the controller’s planned processing. It also inquired whether it had initiated its own proceedings or if it had analysed whether the processing conformed to the GDPR. The DPC responded to the questionnaire but did not respond to the AEPD’s inquiries about its own proceedings or analysis of the processing.","The AEPD adopted provisional measures prohibiting the processing pursuant to Article 66 GDPR’s urgency procedure. It considered that the controller’s planned processing lacked a legal basis and would infringe the principles of legality, data minimisation and storage limitations under Articles 5(1)(a), (c) and (e) GDPR.

First, the AEPD found that the controller lacked a legal basis for processing under 6(1)(b) GDPR. Given the controller’s status as a private enterprise, a public interest could not be a ‘necessity’ for fulfilling a contract executed for commercial purposes. In fact, the AEPD considered that the purpose of processing the data pursuant to EDI and VIU was to aggregate information that it could then commercialize to third parties. The AEPD also noted that the controller failed to explain how it would exclusively process data of users over the age 18 for EDI and VIU purposes, given that it had no reliable mechanism in place to determine the age of its users. The AEPD considered the controller’s complete lack of legal basis -- based on necessity of contract or otherwise -- to violate the principle of legality pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

Second, the AEPD considered the controller’s processing of data excessive. It observed no justification for the use of a system that ensures that only the data of persons of legal age are processed. In addition, the controller aimed to collect city information based on data subjects’ IP addresses, when the narrowest degree of necessary data was merely nationality. The collection of such data, the AEPD found, is excessive relative to the supposed purpose of informing data subjects about elections.

Finally, the AEPD determined that the controller violated the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. The storage period, which was redacted in the decision, was not justified by the controller in relation to the stated purposes. The AEPD considered this to indicate an additional purpose of the processing operation.

Ultimately, the AEPD considered that the collection of the data via EDI and VIU put the rights of data subjects at great risk. It noted that the volume of data gathered would permit the controller to create elaborate profiles of users. This loss of control over one’s own data, the AEPD said, demonstrates a patent violation of the right to data protection and a significant risk for data subjects’ rights and liberties. Given the impending launch of the products and high risks, the AEPD invoked the urgency procedure for exceptional circumstances under Article 66 GDPR. It accordingly adopted immediate interim measures to prohibit the controller’s anticipated processing with EDI and VIU.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 66"
"The Finnish DPA was notified that the City of Helsinki (the controller) had not concluded a data processing agreement with the company that maintained an online pupil welfare service that allowed pupils to contact a school counsellor or school psychologist. The DPA then asked the controller to explain who was responsible for maintaining the service.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it had no contractual documentation with the company maintaining the service regarding roles or data protection. The controller also stated that it no longer used the company to operate the service and that the service was now maintained by the controller.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that another company had carried out the regular maintenance of the online service on behalf of the controller and had thus acted as a processor of personal data. The DPA found that, in the absence of a data processing agreement between the parties, the company maintaining the service was not contractually bound, for example, to ensure security of processing or confidentiality.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 28(3) GDPR by failing to comply with its obligation as controller to enter into a data processing agreement with the processor. As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 28, Article 58"

In response to the request, the controller clarified that the service in question was a participatory budgeting platform where city residents could discuss the development of the city and suggest things they would like to see in their own residential area. Following the DPA's request, the controller had discovered a data breach in relation to the platform.

The controller stated that the user profiles of all 124,000 people registered on the platform had been publicly searchable and viewable by default through the platform's own search function. The profiles had also been viewable through Google Search and had displayed at least the first and last name of the users.

The controller also noted that all profiles had been deleted and the possibility to register on the service had been closed. In addition, the controller had disabled the search function of the service and requested Google to remove the search results from Google Search.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that, given the nature of the service, it could not be considered necessary that the user profiles had been publicly searchable and visible to all through the platform's own search function.

"On 17 June 2021, the City of Copenhagen (“the controller”) reported a personal data breach to the Danish DPA (“Datatilsnynet”).

During a routine scan on 15 June 2021 of the controller’s open file drive, the controller found that there was access to a normally closed drive that contained personal data. The data included name and address information, but the files also contained information about well-being, language assessment and information about children's dental and health care. Normally, only four data warehouse developers have access to this data, but now approximately 37,500 employees in the municipality gained unauthorised access to information about up to 3.7 million people. This was due to human error as an employee with administrator access mistakenly gave too wide access to the drive during a disk swap.

The unauthorised access existed for almost two months until the controller discovered the error. The access was then closed and reported to the DPA. The controller stated there was a very low probability of an ordinary employee encountering the drive, as it required special prerequisites to find it. Network registration was turned off on the individual PCs, which meant that employees could not find the drive through ordinary searches on the PC. It also meant that the URL had to be known or the drive had to be actively scanned for. Moreover, the controller, after investigation, found that no scanning tool had been used to look for open drives during the period of the breach.

Furthermore, examination of the administrative log showed access only for people with a work-related need. However, the controller's logs of all administrative IT users' potential access to the drive only went back in time 35 days and therefore the controller could not definitively conclude that no employees other than those with a work-related need had accessed the data during the period.

The controller also stated that the majority of the files were not immediately readable for those who gained unauthorised access as this required a specific program to process the data. The controller argued that the data was thus not readable for a random administrative employee.

The controller stated that they would implement stronger safeguards to ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented to reduce the risk of future breaches and to ensure that potential breaches are detected quickly.","The DPA held that there had been unauthorised access to personal data, and thus found there was a personal data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR.

The DPA stated that it follows from Article 32(1) GDPR that the controller must take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the controller's processing of personal data. The DPA held that the controller did not ensure that only employees with a work-related need had access to the drive and that there was a set-up where a single employee's error could result in a breach involving 3.7 million people. The DPA also criticised the controller that it did not test immediately after the transfer of the data whether the correct employees had access to the drive. This would have immediately revealed the error. Therefore, the DPA found that the controller’s processing of personal data had not been carried out in accordance with Article 32(1) GDPR.

The DPA held that when developing new applications or swapping file drives, it must first be assessed whether it is necessary to move and store the data in personally identifiable form in the future. The DPA stated that if it is necessary for the purpose of the processing, a possible security measure could be that the controller ensures that the data is encrypted so that only an authorised person can read and unlock the data. The DPA held that a proprietary data format  cannot be equated with encryption, as there are often viewers or plugins that make it relatively easy to read these file formats. Moreover, the DPA held that the controller is also required to check that the intended access management, control and logging are working before the change is released for operation.

The DPA took into account that the controller is implementing a number of measures to prevent a similar situation from occurring again. Thus, the DPA issued a reprimand against the controller for violating Article 32(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 32"
"On 20 May 2023, the DPA carried out an on-site investigation into the operations of a company called AQAPHOTO (‘controller’), carried out the at the Līvu Akvaparks, a water amusement park. The controller’s primary activity was offering photography services to visitors (‘data subjects’) at the amusement park. For the purpose to capture and provide photographic memories, the controller hired photographers which took photos of the visitors and were recognizable by wearing yellow T-shirts saying “AQUA FOTO TEAM”. The visitors could then select their photos on the monitors located at the AQUAPHOTO booth. In addition, the controller used facial recognition technology software to identify the individuals that requested their photos and offer the pictures to them.

The controller informed about its data processing operations in 4 different forms available to the visitors. However, their privacy policy was inconsistent across these different places.

1. On the amusement’s park website, the privacy policy stated that visitors would be photographed by walking up to the photographers and then obtain their photos at the AQUAPHOTO stand.
2. The section concerning “Visitor rules” published on their website further specified that visitors with minors under their guardianship may be photographed in the amusement park. If the visitors did not wish to be photographed they had to take a distinguishing sign from the employees of the AQUAPHOTO stand.
3. On the contrary, the “Terms and Conditions of Photo Services and Personal Data Processing” posted at the company’s stand said that distinguishing sign could be obtained from the amusement park’s cash desk or the photographers hired by AQUAPHOTO.
4. By a visual information poster at the amusement park’s cash desk with a text saying: 
  * Don't be afraid of the AQUAPHOTO photographer. You do not want to be photographed in red. Green wristbands make many beautiful photographs’;
  * The posted also provided that the data subjects would not receive photographs of other visitors of the amusement park.

The DPA officers were later informed by the controller that the collection of visitors’ personal and biometric data was based on two different consents:

1. Consent during the visit – the data subjects were offered two colored wristbands before entering amusement park: green for consent to pictures and red for rejecting this processing. In this case, no biometric data processing is involved.
2. Consent after the visit – after visiting the amusement park, data subjects consented to biometric data processing, allowing the system to use facial images to recognize and select their relevant photos

In addition to these inconsistencies, the DPA’s inspection revealed that the data processing practice did not meet the data protection standard the company declared.

1. the employees of the amusement park did not inform the inspection officers about the possible processing of personal data by means of photography;
2. they did not offer the officers the option to choose between the red or green wristband to express their preference regarding this type of data processing. At the ticket office, the inspection officers also noticed a sign saying: “Don’t be afraid of the AQUAPHOTO photographer” and another one in Latvian, English and Russian: “You do not want to be photographed in red. Green wristbands make many beautiful photographs’.” However, the officers also noted that the visitors did not actually wore a green wristband. The adults wore a grey one and children wore red wristbands. Additionally, the photographs were also taken at various attractions sites, such as “Unique Tornado”, “Jacuzzi” or other attractions with pools where the wristbands were not visible;
3. the officers asked if visiting the stand before entering the amusement park was required. The cashier clarified it was not obligatory; they would be photographed during their visit and could select the photos afterward at the stand;
4. none of the visitors of the park was asked for their consent before the photographs were taken;
5. despite the fact that one of the inspection officers informed the company’s employees that they visited the park alone, they were offered to buy a photo that included both them.

The officers concluded that contrary to the information provided by the amusement park and the company, the data subjects are in fact not verbally informed about the processing of their data by the means of photography carried out on the premises of the park.

The controller claimed that the DPA should consider that the consent was collected implicitly. According to the EDPB Opinion 05/2020 consent, whether explicit or not, must be given by a statement or an explicit affirmative action and must express consent to the processing of personal data. This is complemented by recital 32 GDPR which states that consent should be given by an explicit affirmative act including oral communication. Lastly, the controller raised arguments against the DPA’s inspection at the amusement park and claimed that according to Article 15 Lithuanian Data Protection Law, any inspection must take place in cooperation with the controller. Therefore, the evidence collected should be deemed invalid.","To begin with, the DPA discussed the transparency requirements and how they were met by the controller. In regard to the various forms of privacy policies published by the controller, it was explained that making them visible and easily accessible only partly complies with the principle of transparency. Privacy policy should be also concise, comprehensible and in clear and plain language to meet all the elements if this principle. That is to say, the fact that the data subject has access to information on the processing of personal data does not in itself mean that the principle of transparency has been respected. In addition, the information on the poster was not explained properly for visitors to know what ‘green wristbands’ mean, how to obtain them or what kind of consent control measures are put in place. This information is also not provided orally and is otherwise misleading from other available source concerning consent collection. In this regard, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(a), (2) and 12(1) GDPR.

The DPA stated that, in relation to the collection of consent, the GDPR does not provide for a clear form of consent but lays down requirements for obtaining a valid consent. In this case, the controller took photographs on the premises of the amusement park and processed ordinary personal data for which unambiguous consent is required. The key is to obtain an active consent, i.e. a positive action or indication of the person’s willingness to a specific processing operation – taking photos. Therefore, controller’s photographers shall not take photographs on the basis of silence or otherwise arbitrary photography by visitors of the amusement park. Taking photos based on implied consent is possible only if there is an active action on the part of the visitor such as:

1. inviting the photographer to take the photo;
2. visibly posing for the camera;
3. the visitor smiling and looking at the photographer;
4. consent given in advance, during the visit or other obvious actions from which it can be inferred that the visitor wishes to be photographed

Moreover, the DPA listed possible situations which could be misunderstood as consent:

1. visitor does not take active steps to approach the photographer to take the photograph
2. the photographer pays attention to the visitor of the water park but the visitor does not pay attention to the photographer and does not take active steps to take the photograph
3. the visitor indicates by gestures that they do not wish to be photographed

It was concluded that according to the evidence of this case, the manner of obtaining consent by the controller is not compliant with the above-mentioned requirements because:

1. the controller could not demonstrate the valid consent as many photos were not based on a clear affirmative action (visitors were not aware of photographers taking pictures at certain attractions)
2. consent mechanism was not specified and explicitly explained to the visitors and several options were available to collect it. In fact, implied actions likely gave the photographers false impression of an expression of informed will of data subjects to take the photos.

Therefore, the controller did not provide the data subjects with the right to consent or object to the processing and therefore violated Article 5(1)(a), 6 and 7 GDPR.

With regards to the processing of biometric data, the DPA concluded that this processing is carried out on the basis of explicit consent of a data subject according to Article 9(2)(a) GDPR. Additionally, in the absence of consent, the data subjects can conduct a manual selection of images by visual identification which will not involve processing of biometric data. This type of processing is based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the purpose of concluding a transaction for the purchase of photographs. Therefore, the DPA found no infringement of processing of biometric data.

Regarding the controller’s argument on the validity of the inspection at the amusement park, the DPA considered that this interpretation of the legal provisions is unjustified. Article 15 of the Lithuanian Data Protection Law refers to cases when the inspection is carried out by the DPA using the administrative power granted to it by the regulatory enactments. In the present case, the DPA officers obtained the information not by exercising public authority but by carrying out these acts as any natural person would since they were visiting public places. As a result, the requirements of Article 15 of the Lithuanian Data Protection Law do not apply and the evidence of this case is admissible.

As a result, the DPA fined the controller €1,000 for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), (2), 6, 7 and 12(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12"

Two new functions of the analytics tool, the Automatic Advanced Matching (AAM) and the Automatic Events (AE), were activated by the controller by mistake.

The AAM looked for recognisable form fields and other sources on the controller’s website that contain information such as first name, last name and email address. It transferred data to Meta in hashed form (an irreversible one-way process that converts data into a unique string of characters) if a data subject filled in any of the five different forms of the controller’s website or mobile app. When users logged in and accepted marketing cookies, the AAM collected the personal data, including personal identification number, contact details, loan amounts on existing loans, employers, type of employment and account numbers. With this, Meta-Pixel could match the hashed data with the behaviour of data subjects to the website to obtain a more detailed profile of the data subjects. It is unknown whether this resulted in targeted advertising.

The AE analysed which buttons on the controller’s website and mobile app the user pressed and transmitted this data in plain text to Meta to then make suggestions about marketing on Facebook. However, the controller categorised visual fields as buttons on their website and mobile app. Via AE, personal data of data subjects were collected, including securities holdings and value, loan amounts, account number and email address and social security number.

The controller found out by an external source that the personal data of 500,001 to 1 million individuals were incorrectly transferred to Meta (formerly Facebook) between 15 November 2019 and 2 June 2021 by accidentally turning on these two functions of Meta Pixel. The controller, afterwards, could not determine who and how these functions were turned on.

On June 8, 2021, the Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten - ""IMY"") received the data breach notification from the controller.

The controller argued that the transfer of the data did not entail any harm or risk to the data subjects, as Meta did not use the data for its own purposes or transfer it further, and the data was erased after a request by the controller. All data was transferred by Meta pixel to Meta and the controller's own advertising account with Meta.","The DPA found that the two functions of the analytics tool that were accidentally activated led to the unauthorised transfer of personal data to Meta. The DPA noted that the data transferred included sensitive information and concerned a very large number of people. Most of the data was transferred in plain text, posing a high risk to data subjects. The DPA also noted that the controller failed to detect the activation of these functions. The DPA found that although the controller had formalised procedures in place to ensure the correct processing of personal data before, during and after the introduction of new functions on the website, the controller did not follow its procedures in this case. The controller only became aware of the unauthorised transfer by an external source.

The DPA held that the controller had an obligation under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR to protect personal data against unauthorised access and processing by implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures. The DPA found that the controller should have had a systematic security programme in place so that the unauthorised transfer of personal data would have been detected by regularly checks. The controller’s failure to detect and prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data indicated a lack of sufficient security measures, thus violating Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32(1) GDPR.

The DPA found that these were not minor infringement as referred to in Recital 148. Moreover, the controller could not be considered to have been unaware that its behaviour violated the GDPR according to the DPA. The DPA therefore held there were grounds for imposing a fine against the controller.

Thus, the DPA imposed a fine of €1,318,955.55 (SEK 15 million) against the controller for violating Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32(1) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"The controller is a company which operates restaurants. On 26 July 2023, the controller notified the DPA about a data breach occurred on 19 July 2023: an employee had lost a flash drive containing unencrypted data about another employee, such as their address, date of birth, passport, picture and salary data. Moreover, some financial data were stored in the drive in an encrypted way.

On 26 September 2023 the DPA initiated an ex officio proceeding.

The controller stated that it had instructed all employees to encrypt their files when stored in an external flash drive and that the loss occurred in the workplace premises.","Firstly, the DPA recalled that, according to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures adequate security of personal data by means of appropriate technical or organizational measures. According to the DPA, a concretization of this principle is Article 24(1) GDPR, which obliges the controller to implement appropriate technical measures and organizational to carry out processing in accordance with the GDPR.

Moreover, the DPA pointed out that the controller must also comply with the obligation set by Article 32 GDPR. It noted that this article obliges the controller to carry out a 2-step analysis: firstly, it must determine the risks involved in the processing of personal data and, secondly, determine what technical and organizational measures will be appropriate to ensure a degree of security corresponding to that risk.

The DPA observed that the risk assessment analysis conducted by the controller did include the possibility of a flash drive theft, but not of a loss of it. Therefore, the DPA held that the controller failed to take into account all possible risks associated with the use of external data carriers by employees.

Moreover, the DPA focused on the fact that, even if the controller had considered this risk, it did not implement sufficient security measures. The DPA acknowledged that the controller had instructed its employees to encrypt the data contained in flash drives. However, the DPA also noted that the controller simply relied on its employees and did not take any further measure. Furthermore, the DPA found that the controller failed in periodically reviewing the risk assessment. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR.

As for the fine, the DPA believed that the violation is of significant gravity and serious nature (Article 83(1)(a) GDPR) and is unintentional (Article 83(1)(b) GDPR). Moreover, the DPA took into account the categories of personal data affected by the data breach. It recalled the EDPB Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, which state that a more stringent response is needed when the dissemination of data immediately causes harm or discomfort to the data subject, even if the data are not sensitive. On these grounds, the DPA issued a fine of €54,600 (PLN 238,345).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 24, Article 32"
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a media company (the controller) had requested the data subject to deliver a signed form to the controller's premises in order to exercise the right of access. The data subject made an access request by email but did not provide any other information to confirm their identity. Therefore, the controller did not provide access to the personal data.

The DPA had asked the controller to explain why it had refused to comply with the data subject's request and how it had facilitated the exercise of data subject rights.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it could not comply with the data subject's request because the data subject had not provided additional information to confirm their identity. The controller stated that the data subject must identify themselves by means of a form containing the data subject's name, personal identification number, address, telephone number and email address.

The controller also noted that the form must be signed and delivered in person to the controller's premises, where the data subject must identify themselves with a government-issued ID.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the controller's method of identifying the data subject was not based on a case-by-case assessment. Therefore, contrary to the principle of data minimisation, the controller had processed a wider range of personal data than necessary to identify the data subject, in particular since the controller had not provided reasons why it was not possible to identify the data subject.

The DPA emphasised that it was disproportionate to require data subjects to personally deliver a signed form to the controller's premises and to identify themselves with an ID, especially for data subjects who do not live close to the controller's premises.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, Article 12(2) GDPR and Article 12(6) GDPR. As a result, and in accordance with Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA ordered the controller to amend its access request and identity verification policies to comply with the aforementioned provisions of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 58"
"The Finnish DPA was notified that a bus operator (the controller) had published the personal phone numbers of its bus drivers on the company intranet, although the drivers also had a personal business phone provided by the controller. The DPA then asked the controller to explain the purpose for which it processed the personal phone numbers of its drivers.

In response to the request, the controller clarified that it published the personal phone numbers of its drivers in the company's intranet telephone directory because it was necessary for the drivers to be able to communicate with each other by phone while on duty. The controller emphasised that each employee had a personal password for the intranet in order to ensure the technical protection of personal data. In the controller's view, the processing was based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as it was necessary for the performance of the employment contract.

Regarding the separate business phones, the controller stated that they were primarily intended for mobile data use only, as the use of the phone was restricted so that it could only be used to make calls to specifically authorised numbers, such as supervisors and emergency numbers. It was therefore impossible to communicate with other drivers during the working day using only the business phone.","First, the DPA noted that when processing the personal data of its employees, the employer must take into account the necessity requirement of Section 3 of the Finnish Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life, according to which the employer may only process personal data that is directly necessary for the employee's employment relationship, that is related to the exercise of the rights and obligations of the parties to the employment relationship or benefits provided by the employer to the employee, or that arises from the specific nature of the work concerned.

On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that it was not necessary to disclose the bus drivers' personal phone numbers to other bus drivers. The DPA stated that it would have been possible for the controller to organise communication between the drivers in a less intrusive way, such as by using the business phone provided by the controller.

The DPA also noted that some employees may have had their personal phone number removed from the directory by their telecommunications provider. Thus, by disclosing an employee's ex-directory phone number to other drivers, the processing may have had an impact on the employee's private life and thus caused harm to the employee.

With regard to the legal basis established by the controller, the DPA found that the parties to the employment contract are the employer and the employee. Therefore, the disclosure of an employee's personal data, such as a phone number, to other employees of the organisation cannot be based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 6(1) GDPR and Section 3 of the Finnish Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life. As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR. On the basis of Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA also ordered the controller to ensure that it no longer processes its employees' personal phone numbers in the company's intranet telephone directory in such a way that they are visible to other bus drivers.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 58"
"The controller is an Italian municipality which decided to implement a mobile application. This application was made available on app stores between December 2020 and January 2021. It allowed citizens to send notifications to the Local Police about unsafe areas. After getting this notification, the Police could use the video surveillance system to monitor the area. Therefore, personal data of both the person who made the report and the people recorded by the camera were collected.

The software collected the phone number of the reporting person and the location data. The former was then stored for 7 days, allowing the Police to contact the person to get more details about the incident. After 7 days, only location data was kept in an anonymised way.

The controller decided not to manage this app on itself, but to outsource the development and the management of both the app and the video surveillance system to a company which is owned by the municipality.

The application was temporarily deactivated from April to June 2022. On 11 July 2022 it was permanently deactivated, after the DPA started an investigation on the matter.","Firstly, the DPA pointed out that the controller made the application available on app stores even though it was still in a beta version and, therefore, had not been completely tested yet. Moreover, the controller kept using the app even though the DPO had warned it about the data protection pitfalls of this processing.

In addition, the DPA highlighted that, in the first release of the app, users could freely make a report, without the situations that could potentially be the subject of a report being predetermined. In the second release, the controller added a predefined list of categories to classify the report. However, users were still able to send a report of an “undefined” type. The DPA noted that this could lead to the collection of non-necessary data or data falling under Articles 9 or 10 GDPR. Moreover, it was also possible to make a report about domestic violence or bullying incidents, matters that exceeded the controller's law enforcement competences under national law.

Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(2) and 25 GDPR, as the controller did not, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate measures to ensure that the GDPR was complied with.

Secondly, the DPA noted that the controller published on its website a privacy policy about this specific processing only on 22 April 2022, while in the period between that day and December 2022 no privacy policy was available. The DPA did not uphold the argument of the controller about the fact that a shorter privacy notice had been available on the app itself since April 2022. According to the DPA, this notice was however not compliant with Article 13(2)(a) GDPR as it contained wrong information about the data storage period. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13 GDPR.

Thirdly, the DPA focused on the relationship between the controller and the processor. The DPA noted that the two entities had never signed a written binding agreement, even though the latter was carrying out several processing activities, including the one at stake, on behalf of the controller. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 28(3) and (9) GDPR.

Fourthly, the DPA stated that in this case the controller would have needed to carry out a DPIA, since this processing was likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In particular, the DPA stressed that the processing was a “large scale” processing and involved location data and potentially data relating to criminal convictions under Article 10 GDPR. However, the controller did not carry out such an assessment and, therefore, violated Article 35(1) GDPR.

Finally, the DPA noted that the Local Police staff could access the database with a generic password provided by the processor, and not with login credentials linked to a specific person. According to the DPA, this meant that, on the one hand, the controller was unable to identify the specific person who had accessed to data. On the other hand, if the controller had set up different user accounts with varying levels of access, it could have restricted access to only what each user needed for their job. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR.

On these grounds, the DPA issued a fine of €15,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 13, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32, Article 35"
"Toyota Bank Poland S.A. (controller) is a bank established under Polish law. On 31 March 2021 an employee of the controller, by mistake, sent a letter with personal data of the data subject to another client. The letter contained personal data from the loan agreement concluded between the data subject and the controller, specifically: name, surname, bank account number, address, national ID number (PESEL),  ID number. The (incorrect) addressee picked-up and opened the letter. Eventually, the controller took the letter back by sending a courier.

The controller registered the incident within the internal register and performed a risk assessment. During the risk assessment, the controller took into account European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) data breach guideline https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/dbn-severity ENISA Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal data breaches. According to the controller, the breach affected only one person, the letter was swiftly retrieved and the (incorrect) addressee was the controller’s client and helped to solve the problem. Because of that, the controller assigned the breach a low-risk level. Hence, the controller did not notify the DPA. Nevertheless, the controller decided to inform the data subject about the breach by sending a letter.

The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA, claiming the controller unlawfully disclosed their personal data. During the complaint proceedings, on 7 September 2022, the controller notified the DPA about the breach. The notification was done almost 18 months after the breach. The controller explained the late notification with the minor risk assigned to the breach.

As a consequence of late data breach notification, the DPA initiated ex officio proceedings regarding the violation of Article 33(1) GDPR.","According to DPA, the controller failed to adequately assess the risk of the data breach. The DPA emphasised that the data subject interests should be the main reference when conducting a data breach risk assessment. Disclosed personal data contained the national ID number (PESEL) and other personal data. As such, it might be used for many unauthorised purposes, especially identity theft or fraud, and cause material or non-material damage to data subject. The DPA based it argumentation on EDPB Guidelines 9/2022 and EDPB Guidelines 01/2021 and jurisprudence of Polish administrative and regional court on cases where the disclosure of a national ID number (PESEL) was involved.

Also, the (incorrect) addressee did not qualify as a trusted party, since the controller was unable to anticipate the addressee’s further actions with disclosed personal data. Consequently, the data breach was more serious, and posed a higher risk, compared to the risk identified by the controller. Because of that, the controller was obliged to notify the DPA, not only the data subject.

In conclusion, the DPA found a violation of Article 33(1) GDPR and imposed a fine of Є18,000 (PLN 78,575.40).",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 33
"Following an investigation in 2019-2020, the EDPS isdues recommendations and the Commission modified the ILA. The EDPS investigated whether these modifications were sufficient to bring processing in compliance with data protection requirements and found infringements. Data accessed by Microsoft are: -	identity and contact data of users (when signing on to the service and when checking the licenses) -	data generated by the users while using the software -	data generated by Microsoft based on the usage of the software The EDPS found that the processing presents significant risks as -	it monitors the behaviour of users, -	combines datasets and -	even uses artificial intelligence Reference date is the 12th May 2021, the date when the investigation was launched. Some measures were taken meanwhile by the Commission, which were taken into account in the recommendations issued.","The infringements found were summarised in three groups: -	purpose limitation -	transfer to third countries -	further unauthorised disclosure or personal data Purpose limitation: It was not sufficiently defined in the International License Agreement (ILA) that which types of personal data are to be processed of which purposes, there was only a list of purposes: Microsoft uses these data for -	troubleshooting -	billing -	remunerating Microsoft staff, internal reporting and business modelling, financial reporting -	following the use of the system for own reasons (analytics) -	to improve the service – this purpose is considered to be too vague and general by the Art 29 WP -	security risks and the protection of intellectual property The Commission and Microsoft could not demonstrate that all these data were necessary and that a less intrusive collection of data were not sufficient to achieve the purposes cited. Some of these purposes were actually not in the interest of the Commission but for own purposes of Microsoft (like remuneration of their personnel). If the processor processes personal data not on behalf of the controller, this is possible if required by Union or Member State law, but in this case the processor acts as controller and these purposes and the data used for this purposes should have been precisely defined. Also, if data were used for purposes other than for which they were collected, the compatibility of these new purposes with the original ones should have been assessed. As a processor, Microsoft should have processed the personal data on documented instructions by the Commission. This was not ensured as the Commission did not issue sufficiently clear documented instructions to Microsoft. For example, the controller gave instructions for analytics and improvement of the service but these instructions were not sufficiently detailed and precise and did not exclusively concern uses of data for the purposes of the controller. Some instructions were given orally but this was not enabled by the ILA and the oral instructions were not documented. The Commission did not assess whether it is necessary and proportionate to transmit data to Microsoft Ireland and its sub-processors. Further details of this infringement are given under the part on further unauthorised disclosure or personal data. Transfer to third countries The Commission transferred personal data to Microsoft. Concerning Microsoft US, after the reference date, the Commission adopted the Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework, which is an adequacy decision in respect of recipients in the US who register under this framework, which Microsoft did. Therefore only the findings concerning transfer to third countries are relevant. To be noted that the EDPS found that even when the software and data storage is property of MS, it is direct transfer to these subcontractors and cannot therefore be covered by transfer under the TDPF to MS US and onward transfer from MS US to the subcontractors under SCCs. The EDPS found that in was not clearly specified in the ILA what types of personal data can be transferred to which recipients in which third country and that the Commission did not appraise the transfers and therefore could not determine whether any supplementary measures are necessary. In addition, the Commission should have performed a TIA and (as there are no SCCs applicable by EUIs as exporters) ahould have submitted the DPAs with these processors or subprocessors in third countries to the EDPS for approval. As a consequence, the Commission did not implement effective supplementary measures for these transfers. Another point was that the “EU storage guarantee” offered by Microsoft does not cover all types of data, some data may be accessible to recipients in third countries. The “EU Data Boundary” also has numerous exceptions and exclusions which cover customer data, service generated data, diagnostic data and professional services data. These findings will also be relevant also for transfers to the US if, as initiated before the Court of Justice by some privacy advocates, the Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework is invalidated. Further unauthorised disclosure or personal data A specific reference was made to Article 9, which concerns transmission of personal data by EU institutions to recipients established in the EU. According to the EDPS, this article is also applicable to transmission of personal data to processors of EUIs. Therefore all transmission of personal data should be in the public interest and if the data subject’s legitimate interests may be prejudiced, the controller has to weigh the competing interests and establish that it is proportionate to transmit the personal data. The purpose of management and functioning of the Commission, use of products the staff is familiar with etc. was not found to be the purpose of processing of the personal data by MS. As long as the purposes are not specified, specific and explicit, it is not possible to do this weighing. In conjunction with that, the EDPS found that the Commission did not ensure that transfers take place “solely to allow tasks within the competence of the controller to be carried out”. Further findings of the EDPS concern mainly the transfer of personal data to MS and its affiliates and subcontractors. The findings: Organisational and contractual measures to restrict/prevent access of third country authorities are not sufficient, technical measures are necessary. The EDPS also found that the organisational measures applied are only limiting transfers but does not ensure that transfers are protected.  Further, the encryption is only found to be an adequate measure, if the controller is in control of the encryption key. In this case, customers only control the keys that they can revoke them but Microsoft has access to the keys, in fact, MS is in possession of the encryption key, and thus, even when law does not oblige it to decrypt the data on an authority request, it may do it voluntarily. Also, the ILA does not detail encryption of data other than “customer data”, i.e. diagnostic data, service generated data or professional services data. The contract also enabled the processor not to notify the Commission about a request of disclosure also when EU or Member State law did not prohibit this notification and enabled recipients in third countries not to notify requests for disclosure also when the law prohibiting it did not constitute a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society respecting the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 28, Article 46"
"On 11 December 2023, the DPA initiated an investigation concerning the processing of personal data in relation to the Visa Information System (VIS), carried out by the Ministry of Immigration and Integration (Udlændinge- og Integrationsminister – UIM) through its system IVR-VIS.

The DPA focused its investigation on the deletion practices of the controller. The DPA noted that, according to the deletion policy, visa cases should be automatically deleted after 5 years from, for example, the expiration of a visa, date of refusal, confirmation, etc.

However, the investigation showed that the controller had so far not monitored compliance with its own deletion policy. Moreover, there was no policy for premature deletion when a visa applicant obtains Danish citizenship by naturalization in accordance with Article 25(1) VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008. According to this article, when a visa applicant obtains the citizenship of a Member State, data relating to their application file must be deleted without delay from the VIS even if the normal data retention period of 5 years, set by Article 23(1) VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008, has not expired yet.","First, the DPA noted that Recital 17 of the VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008 states that Directive 95/46/EC (now GDPR) applies to the processing of data by Member States pursuant to the VIS Regulation.

Second, the DPA recalled that, according to the storage limitation principle, personal data must not be stored for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This follows from Article 5(1)(e) GDPR and, in the specific case, also from Article 30(1) VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008.

Third, the DPA noted that the controller was not monitoring the deletion of personal data in the IVR-VIS system. The DPA held that ongoing monitoring of the controller's established deletion practices working as intended is a prerequisite for the controller under Article 5(2) GDPR to demonstrate compliance with the principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. Therefore, the DPA found that the controller was unable to demonstrate compliance with Article 5(1)(e) GDPR and Article 30(1) VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008.

Fourth, the DPA found that the controller does not immediately delete data if a data subject becomes a citizen as is required by Article 25(1) VIS Regulation (EC) 767/2008. On the contrary, citizens must contact the controller to have their data deleted. The DPA held that this procedure does not fulfil the required premature erasure and is therefore also a violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5
"The controller AS Watson (Health & Beauty Continental Europe) B.V. is a financial holding company that manages and operates several wholesale and retail businesses. One of them is Kruidvat, a Dutch retail, pharmacy and drugstore chain.

In 2019, the Dutch DPA (“Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens”) started an investigation into different websites, including Kruidvat.nl, to review whether the websites complied with the GDPR when placing (tracking) cookies. On first glance, the DPA found that the website did not seem to comply with the requirements of obtaining consent under the GDPR. Therefore, the DPA send a letter to the controller on 29 November 2019, which stated that the controller presumably did not comply with the law on obtaining consent for tracking cookies.  The DPA encouraged the controller in the letter to change its practices for obtaining consent for tracking cookies.

After multiple reviews, the DPA found that the controller still did not change its practices on 16 June 2020. The DPA therefore decided to launch an ex officio investigation into the controller.

In their investigation, the DPA found that the controller placed tracking cookies before obtaining consent from users via a cookie banner. The DPA also found that “accept all cookies” on the controller’s cookie banner was selected by default. Only after clicking through four different steps, was the user able to reject cookies.

The controller argued that the investigation by the DPA was unlawful, because the DPA entered the controller's virtual premises without the controller's consent or knowledge. The DPA also had no legal basis for starting an investigation.","First, the DPA dismissed the controller’s argument and held that the controller’s website is a publicly accessible website, which cannot be equated with entering a business premise. The DPA also has the authority under the GDPR and the Dutch GDPR implementation law (""Uitvoeringswet Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming""), to investigate and proceed with enforcement if there has been a breach of the GDPR.

Secondly, the DPA found that the controller unlawfully processed personal data of users by placing tracking cookies before obtaining consent, violating Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

Thirdly, on rejecting cookies via the controller's cookie banner, the DPA took into account the CJEU judgement in case C-673/17 Planet49. According to the CJEU, there is no legally valid consent if the placing of cookies on the data subject’s devises uses a default tick box, which the data subject must uncheck to refuse consent. The DPA therefore held that by using pre-ticked (tracking) cookies, the controller did not obtain freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent under Article 4(11) GDPR. The controller thus violated Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR for unlawfully processing personal data by not obtaining consent.

The DPA took into account the duration of the violations and noted that the controller changed its practices since 1 October 2020. Now, consenting to cookies is not automatically ticked on anymore. It also does not place cookies anymore before obtaining consent.

The DPA therefore fined the controller €600,000 for violating Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6"
"Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital in Rome reported a data breach involving its ""Charter of Health"" portal. On a specified day, a patient mistakenly accessed another patient's report due to a software error. The issue stemmed from the Dedalus Dnlab software provided by Dedalus Italia S.p.A., which sent incorrect patient identifiers in HL7 messages. This caused reports to be wrongly associated with patients in the hospital's integrated systems. The breach affected 24 reports.

The hospital promptly notified authorities and took corrective actions, including requesting Dedalus to implement non-regression testing to prevent future occurrences. They also communicated with affected patients and provided additional support.

Dedalus contended that it was not contractually required to perform regular vulnerability assessments and argued that the error was accidental and limited in scope. They claimed the breach was due to an isolated incident and requested either the closure of the case or a lesser penalty.","The findings underscored that Dedalus, despite its arguments about the limitations of its contractual obligations, did not adequately address the security needs or conduct necessary periodic checks and failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures as required by GDPR. As a result, the breach lasted for four days and involved a manageable number of patients with no substantial evidence of damage or misuse.

This resulted in the email addresses of the data subject being disclosed to each other.

After receiving a report by one of the data subject, the controller made a data breach notification to the DPA according to Article 33(1) GDPR.

The controller argued that the data breach happened due to a human mistake and that it had repeatedly instructed its employees to use the “bcc” field when sending emails to multiple people.

Moreover, the controller pointed out that the number of data subjects concerned was quite low and that the breach lasted for a short period of time.","First, the DPA noted that an email address is personal data even in the case it is not composed by the name and the surname of the data subject, since it however allows to identify a natural person.

Secondly, the DPA pointed out that data relating to the administration of a medication is data concerning health under Article 9(1) GDPR, which need a higher protection since its processing implies a higher risk for the freedom and rights of the data subjects.

The Golf Union membership number consists of a country part, a club part and a membership number, e.g. fi-123-4321, of which the last 4 digits make up the actual membership number.

The controller considered that the login policy was adequate from a security perspective. The controller stated that obtaining the information required for login required research from several sources and could not be directly deduced by a third party. The controller emphasised that the user could also change the default password at a later stage.","On the basis of the information provided by the controller, the DPA considered that the system operated by the controller had a predictable login mechanism that could not be considered to prevent unauthorised access to the personal data of the users of the system.

The DPA found that the controller's golf app allowed unauthorised access to other people's personal data due to weak or non-existent password policies. The DPA noted that although login information would have to be collected from more than one source, this was possible given the purpose of the system and the general knowledge of users about other users.

On the basis of the information gathered, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 25(1) GDPR and Article 32(1)(b) GDPR by failing to ensure that its golf app had adequate organisational and technical safeguards.

As a result, the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) GDPR. Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, the DPA also ordered the controller to bring its processing operations into compliance with the GDPR with regard to the security policy of the golf system it operates, paying particular attention to the security of the password policy.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 25, Article 32, Article 58"
"The DPA carried out a control check on the institutional website of the public administration (""Controller”), and verified it was not possible to find the contact details of the DPO. Besides that, the Controller didn't communicate the DPO's contact details to the DPA in a dedicated channel for that purpose.

Therefore, the investigations carried out found no evidence of the appointment of the DPO by the Controller.

The DPA notified the Controller based on the Article 58(2)GDPR related to the lack of publication and communication to the Authority of the DPO's contact informations and the lack of proof that a DPO have been designated, consequently violating Article 37 (1) and Article 37 (7)GDPR.

The Controller submitted its defence, stating, among other things, that:

- A employee of the Entity was designated DPO, but besides the DPO role itself, they held (and still holds) other professional roles, such as head of several services within the Entity (Secretariat of the Director of Sector I, Assistance to the Bodies, Information Systems, Tourism and ultimately the Legal Service);

- The DPO'S contact have been on display on the controller's website and on Transparent Administration since before the notification received;

- The controller immediately informed the DPA about the DPO's contact details after receiving the notification;

- The nominated DPO fulfilled theirs duties before and after their referral, and they also produced two courses on data protection.","In the DPA analysis, it was observed that the nominated DPO was already responsible for numerous roles, having previously held positions such as the Secretariat of the manager of Sector I, Assistance to the Bodies, Information Systems, Tourism, and Legal Service. This overlap of responsibilities was likely to hinder the DPO's effectiveness due to the limited time available to fulfill the necessary duties associated with the position. Furthermore, these pre-existing roles could potentially lead to conflicts of interest, as they involved decision-making responsibilities regarding the purposes or methods of processing personal data, which would constitute a violation of Article 38(6)GDPR .

The Controller responded by outlining the challenges inherent in the organisational structure of the Entity and the utilization of available resources. It was argued that human resources and time constraints had been considered and that the conflict of interest was assessed, concluding that the employee could indeed be designated as the DPO. Additionally, the Controller noted that a temporary external DPO had been appointed due to the lack of feasible internal candidates other than the one already proposed.

Upon reviewing the defence material, the DPA issued its decision, identifying several key points. First, there was a failure to designate the DPO in accordance with Article 37(1) GDPR. Second, there was a delay in publishing and communicating the DPO's contact details to the DPA, violating Article 37(7) GDPR. Third, the appointed DPO, who held multiple positions, lacked the necessary resources, particularly time, and was potentially in a conflict of interest situation, violating  Article 38(2)GDPR  and Article 38(6)GDPR.

The DPA highlighted that the failure to appoint and provide the DPO's contact details deprived the Controller of a crucial figure for ensuring GDPR compliance and held back the DPA's ability to contact the DPO directly. Although the Controller's efforts to rectify the situation by publishing and communicating the DPO's contact details were acknowledged, these actions were insufficient to mitigate the violations. Consequently, a pecuniary sanction of €6,000 was imposed for violations of Article 37(1)GDPR, Article 37(7)GDPR, Article 38(2) GDPR and Article 38 (6)GDPR in line with Article 83(1) GDPR, ensuring the penalty was effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 37, Article 38"
"The Electoral Commission (“the controller”) servers were accessed by an unknown threat actor on 3 separate occasions. As a result of the incident, the personal data of individuals in the electoral register were affected which contained the names and home addresses of approximately 40,000,000 data subjects.

During the course of this incident, three separate clusters of activity were identified: 1. 24 August 2021, hacker gained access to an on-premise Microsoft exchange server using a security flaw known as the ProxyShell vulnerability chain. The hackers then pretended to be a legitimate user, which allowed them to install hidden programs (web shells) on the server. These programs were used again on 16 September 2021, 13 June 2022 and 02 August 2022. Beginning 14 March 2022, the hacker also installed hidden access points (backdoors) on the system. 2. On 14 March 2022, another hacker exploited the vulnerabilities in the ProxyShell. It could not be determined at this point if the hacker retained the previous access or re-compromised the system again.  3. On 28 October 2021, an employee reported that spam emails were being sent from the controllers server but they were not in the individuals sent items folder on Outlook.

Following the third incident, the server was shut down and scrubbed before being restarted.","The ICO held that, on a basic level, the controller did not have an appropriate patching regime at the time of the incident, which led to a number of vulnerabilities being present on their exchange server. In addition, a report produced during the incident highlighted a further 8 vulnerabilities which could have been exploited by a hacker. This represented a lack of compliance with Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

Contrary to Article 32(1)(b) GDPR, it was also held the controller did not have an appropriate password management policy in place. It’s acceptable use policy only referenced the notion that passwords should not be revealed or written down. During an audit, it was discovered that 1 of the user accounts were still utilised a password they were provided during account allocation. 178 users utilised passwords that were identical or similar to the passwords provided by the service desk upon creation or password reset. There were an additional 33 deactivated accounts with similar passwords.

In light of the incident, the controller implemented the following steps: - Implementation of a multi-factor authentication for all users; - New password policy control; - A solution which supports threat and vulnerability programs; - Implementation of a system/software which monitors all servers, firewalls and internet traffic; - Implemented a technology modernisation plan and onboarded an individual/company to provide.

The computers were only intended for the use by teachers and students as part of the teaching programme. In practice, however, they were also used by teachers for things such as student progress reports and class handovers. Therefore, the computers contained more information about the students, including if they had for example special challenges. None of the computers were encrypted.

After the DPA’s investigation of the breach, they found that there were up to 300 computers in the municipality that were not encrypted and also contained personal data of children.","The DPA reported the controller to the police for inadequate security measures.

"AFIANZA ASESORES, S.L. is a consultancy company engaged in, among other work, the provision of legal advice. A USB stick with a large amount of personal data, including data pertaining to a criminal proceeding, was stolen. The USB was not encrypted.

The controller conducted an internal investigation. It informed the Spanish DPA (AEPD) of the incident 13 days after its occurrence. On 2 July 2021, the AEPD ordered the controller to communicate the breach to data subjects.

On 24 June 2022, the AEPD initiated sanctioning proceedings against the controller and proposed a sanction of €160,000. The AEPD considered that the controller had suffered a breach resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The AEPD noted that it considered the controller’s storage of personal data on a removable device without encryption negligent, resulting in an aggravating factor for the fine.

The controller argued that there was no evidence that a third party had ever accessed the information contained in the USB. Instead, the infringing ‘disclosure’ or ‘breach’ was entirely hypothetical. Thus, the controller argued, it could not be proved that any third party ever improperly accessed the information contained in the USB and no breach of confidentiality could be demonstrated.

The controller also argued that it protected its data diligently and had adequate security measures in place. For instance, all personnel with access to personal data were instructed of their obligations and responsibilities. It also conducted IT audits to verify appropriate measures and security standards in place. The controller emphasised that Article 32 GDPR does not regulate a closed list of security measures – instead, it requires the controller to apply appropriate measures. It thus challenged the focus of the sanctioning proceedings on the absence of encryption on the USB because it was not an obligatory security measure and this did not take account of the controller’s other security measures. Penalising this, the controller argued, was contrary to the principle of culpability.

The controller also defended its delay in notifying the AEPD of the breach, stating that in the 13 days it conducted an internal investigation. It argued that the 72 hour period articulated in Article 33 GDPR is not imperative.","The AEPD found that the controller infringed Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR and imposed a fine of €145,000.

Article 5(1)(f) GDPR: The AEPD recognised that the controller had technical and organisational measures in place. It also recognised that the incident occurred as a result of a criminal act – not due to the lack of security measures on the part of the controller. The fact that a third party had overtaken the controller’s security measures does not imply a per se infringement of the controller’s obligations. Controllers, it considered, are bound to obligations concerning measures, not obligations of results.

The AEPD considered that the loss of the USB containing unencrypted personal data was itself a breach of confidentiality. The fact that the USB was unencrypted and had no way to restrict unauthorized access supposes the violation of the principle of confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

Article 32 GDPR: The controller argued extensively that it had numerous technical and organisational measures in place for data protection. However, the AEPD noted that with regard to the USB specifically, there was no type of protection measure or impediment to access for unauthorised third parties (such as encryption). In  addition, the AEPD noted that it appeared that several security measures were in fact not being observed, permitting the theft of the USB and the breach. Article 32 GDPR is just as breached, the controller noted, when there are no measures adopted as when measures are not properly observed.

While the AEPD recognised that the controller had technical and organisational measures in place, it considered it a different issue that on a particular day and due to particular circumstances, some of the security measures were not properly applied.  As a company dedicated to providing legal advice, the AEPD noted that the controller handles considerable personal data including those relating to criminal offences and penalties. For these reasons, the controller must take greater care to comply with security obligations.

Article 33 GDPR: The AEPD did not find an infringement of Article 33 GDPR because, although the controller exceeded the imperative 72 deadline for reporting the breach to the AEPD, the AEPD did not cite this as an infringement in its resolution to initiate sanctioning proceedings and the limitation period of one year had been exceeded in accordance with national law (Law 3/2018).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"A hackers group attacked one of Polish companies of medical sector - American Heart of Poland SA. The hackers got access to company’s network drives and installed a ransomware software. Following categories of personal data of approximately 21,000 company’s employees and patients was affected:

* Name, surname, name of parents, date of birthday, e-mail address, phone number.
* Address data.
* PESEL number, ID number.
* Bank account number, financial data.
* Data concerning health.
* Credentials of company’s user account. 

The hackers demanded ransom of USD 3,000,000. To make the company paid the ransom, the hackers shared a sample of obtained data on a Darknet website.

Due to the lost of data availability and confidentiality of the data, the company acting as a data controller, notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about the breach, under Article 33 GDPR. In response, the DPA initiated the investigation.

Initially, the controller didn’t find the source of data breach. However, after in-depth analysis of third-party specialist, it turned out that lack of company’s software update led to the breach – there was an exploit within the software, making it possible to gain exterbal control over one of the devices connected to the software. Company’s IT department, responsible for the update failed to do so. Also, the ISO audit of the controller didn't mention the exploit. Moreover, inadequate passwords quality and a phishing attack were indicated as a potential source of the breach.

Additionally, during the investigation, the DPA found the controller stored the data affected by the breach contrary to their own policy – data relating to health had to be stored on a specific drives, not network ones.

The data controller was actively involved in handling the data breach, inter alia by facilitating contact with data subjects (by a dedicated call centre).

The outcome of investigation and identified shortcomings caused the DPA open an ex-officio proceedings against the controller.","The DPA held the controller violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 24(1) GDPR, Article 32(1) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR.

Firstly, the controller failed to assess the risk of data processing prior to the data breach. The controller assigned the majority of processing activities with low to mid-level risk, despite the fact the controller didn’t implement the policy of assessing the security measures. Furthermore, the risk assessment didn’t take into account the risk associated with an inadequate password protection.

Secondly, the controller didn’t regularly test or verify the functioning organisational and security measures nor created a concrete internal policy to do so. As a result, the DPA found erroneous security measures, inter alia referring to the domain configuration, especially the access to the domain (admin access set as a default option) and used software. Moreover, the controller was unable to identify the source of the data breach.

The abovementioned conduct caused the controller didn’t implement appropriate technical and organisational measures under Article 32 GDPR. The DPA emphasised that the majority of identified security shortcomings were still present after the data breach, during the ex-officio investigation.

Consequently, the controller was fined PLN 1,440,549 (€330,000) and ordered to bring processing operations into compliance with relevant provisions of the GDPR, in particular, by implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures.

"A Swedish pharmacy company - Apoteket AB (the controller) was using the Meta pixel for marketing purposes since 2017. The purpose of the pixel was to measure the controller’s marketing activity within Facebook and Instagram and additionally to promote controller’s products to visitors of certain pages (self-care product category). By default, the controller disabled the pixel within the part of the website dedicated to the prescription goods. At the same time, the pixel collected the data about other products offered by the controller, in particular products to treat variety of disorders (for example allergy or stomach disorder) or sexual wellness products.

In 2020, an employee of controller, acting without the authorisation or knowledge of the controller, activated Advanced Matching function of the pixel. The employee was one of three employees managing the pixel within the controller structure. As a result, the controller was provided with supplementary data, which was not necessary for the purposes of data processing, as the pixel collected more data referring to the customers. Additionally, the additional data was transferred to Meta.

When a customer made a purchase with the controller, Meta received hashed data related to the customer, namely the contact data, name and surname, social security data, address data. Meta was then able to match the data with Facebook user ID and eventually deleted the hashed data. The estimated number of data subjects affected by the incident was up to 930,000.

As soon as the controller identified the new settings of the pixel (2022), they disabled the Advanced Matching function. The controller requested Meta to delete the data collected via the pixel. Meta explained they already deleted the data older than two years ago and regarding a newer data, Meta claimed to be unable to delete them manually. Additionally, the controller published an announcement on their website, informing the data subjects about the current situation. Moreover, the controller implemented new technical and organisational measures to reduce the risk of future violations of that kind (inter alia, additional screening of cookie settings of the website, e-learning course for the employees).

The controller notified the Swedish DPA (IMY) about the incident.","The DPA found the controller violated Article 32(1) GDPR. According to the DPA, the category of data processed by the controller via the pixel entailed a high risk for the data subjects (inter alia, due to a potential sensitive nature). Because of that, the controller was obliged, by default, to adequately implement the technical and organisational measures.

The DPA acknowledged the controller’s proactive approach to data protection duties, inter alia detailed risk assessment performed and ongoing compliance monitoring. The controller also established and implemented a policy review of purchased service from the perspective of IT security and data protection. Nevertheless, the employee of controller didn’t follow these rules in practice. Hence, for the DPA, the controller failed to adequately assess the risk associated to the pixel. Also, the controller didn’t identify the erroneous setting of the pixel for two years, which meant the compliance monitoring was not functioning well.

"The DPA opened an ex officio investigation after it learned from social media that the controller, a municipality, had implemented a new app which allows citizens to report crimes.

The controller pointed out that this app helps to detect the parts of the town with more crimes and is, therefore, to be regarded as to fulfill the controller’s “judiciary police” tasks.

Moreover, it noted that only a small amount of the population has actually downloaded it.","First, the DPA pointed out that, according to national law, the local police do not generally have a “judiciary police” function, i.e. the task of preventing and investigating crimes. On the contrary, the local police may have these tasks only when delegated by the state authorities.

Since this was not the case, the DPA held that the controller collected this data without a legal basis and, therefore, found a violation of Article 5(1)(a) and 6(1) GDPR.

Secondly, the DPA noted that the municipality did not develop the app itself, but outsourced the development and the managing of the app to an external company. The DPA also noticed that the municipality had identified as processor, while the external company had been identified as controller. However, the DPA found this identification wrong, since the entity determining the purposes and means of the processing was actually the municipality.

Moreover, the DPA pointed out that the controller did not enter into a binding agreement with the controller according to Article 28(3) GDPR. Therefore, it found a violation of this article.

Thirdly, the DPA found that the privacy policy was not compliant with Article 13 GDPR, since it had insufficient and wrong information. For example, it stated that the municipality was the processor (while it was the controller), it lacked the DPO contact details and did not inform the data subject of their right of filing a complaint with the DPA.

Fourthly, the DPA noted that the controller made the app available to all data subjects without any previous internal act governing the processing at hand. Therefore, according to the DPA, this means that the controller did not implement, before the processing, the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure compliance with the GDPR. For this reason, the DPA found a violation of Article 25(1) GDPR.

Fifthly, it noted that the app had a free text box. This means that users could enter any kind of information, including special categories of data under Article 9 GDPR or data relating to crimes under Article 10 GDPR and, more generally, data which is not relevant for the purposes of the processing at hand.

Therefore, the DPA pointed out that the controller did not implement appropriate measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. Thus, it found a violation of Article 25(2) GDPR.

Finally, the DPA held that the controller was not able to prove that it complied with the data protection principles and that it did not implemented measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. Therefore, it found a violation of Article 5(2) and 24(1) GDPR.

"IDA Forsikring Forsikringsformidling F.M.B.A. (a controller) is a Danish insurance company.

To improve the controller’s customer services, including their quality, as well, to assess the employees’ performance, the controller was recording incoming telephone calls of customer service.

The audio files with recordings were analysed and converted into a text by a data processor. For this purpose, the processor used a speech recognizing software. The software was developed by the processor for past 8 years to optimize the analysis. According to the processor, the conversation recordings were not used in order to train the software.

In order to analyse the employees’ conduct during calls with customers, the software picked up the word used by the employees. This was because the controller implemented a dedicated policy (“conversation tree”) to standardize contact with their customers. Hence, once the analysis was done, the call was assigned with a quality score. Consequently, the controller created and developed a list of positive and negative words (a dictionary) based on experience from approximately 30 million calls. However, according to the processor, the conversation recordings were not used in order to train the software.

Additionally, the analysis of call let the controller to create a statistics on number of inquiries regarding specific topics. The statistical data allowed the controller to improve the customer service (for example by updated the FAQ section). Moreover, using the statistical data the controller was able to better know the clients behaviour and accordingly adapt their marketing and customer services, for example change the content of the newsletter bearing in mind the actual interest of the customers.

The controller claimed they did not use the software to profile employees or customers, since the controller was analysing the conversation, not the individual.

Due to the subject of services provided by the controller, the conversation included various personal data of customers, inter alia, identification data, financial data, details on the insurance policy and in some cases data related to health. For the employees the basic scope of personal data processed covered name, surname, e-mail address, voice.

The abovementioned data processing attracted the attention of media. For that reason, the controller reviewed the processing activities related to the analysis of conversation. Regarding the legal basis of data processing for that purpose, the controller indicated on the consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR for the customers, and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the employees.

Yet, the scope of investigation covered only the matter of phone conversations’ recordings. The DPA stood on the position that the controller collected and stored the phone conversations’ recordings for the purposes of training and quality improvement. It was apparent that the controller relied on the artificial intelligence software to perform the analysis.

The DPA noted the controller scrutinised the processing activity at hand and, as a result, changed its legal basis. Although the consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR was a suitable legal basis for collecting and processing the recordings of conversation, the controller failed to obtain the consents in compliance with the GDPR. The consent obtained at the beginning of each phone conversation between the controller and a customer encompassed many different purposes, leaving no choice for the customer. Hence, the consent was not lawfully obtained, because it was lacking with the granularity requirement (not freely given). Nevertheless, the DPA agreed with the controller that Article 6(1)(f) GDPR was a proper legal basis for processing of employees’ data.

Furthermore, the DPA emphasised the analysis of conversations’ recordings, performed by the processor, was not a separate purpose of processing.

According to the controller, the other bank sent back all the documents. The documents’ integrity was not affected, yet it was probable that the other bank’s employees read the documents. As the documents confidentiality was violated, a data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR occurred. Nevertheless, the controller was of the opinion that the risk posed by the breach was minimised by the statutory bank secrecy. Because of that, the controller didn't see a reason to notify the data subjects in accordance with Article 34 GDPR.

However, the controller notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about the data breach.

During the following proceedings, the DPA requested the controller to notify the data subjects involved about the breach under Article 34 GDPR. The controller asked the DPA to reconsider their request. The controller emphasised the documents were shared with the other bank, the controller’s business partner, which should be treated as “a trusted party”. That was because the other bank, together with the controller, were part of banking sector in Poland. As such, both the controller and the other bank pursue highly regulated business activity, in particular in the field of data protection and cybersecurity. For this reason, the breach didn’t pose “a significant risk of negative consequences for the data subjects”. In addition the other bank’s employees made a statement confirming they didn’t possess the documents’ copies and were unable the identity of the data subjects. Moreover, the other bank’s employees were aware of duties associated with the bank secrecy, as well the liability for its breach under Article 171 para 5 of the Banking law (Prawo bankowe).","The DPA found the controller violated Article 34 GDPR.

The controller correctly identified the incident as the data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR. However, the controller failed to assess the risk of the data breach. Due to the character of data disclosed, the breach posed a high risk to rights and freedoms of data subjects, inter alia, an identity theft or banking frauds.

Although the data was shared erroneously with the other bank, the status of the bank didn’t automatically mean it was “a trusted party”. The bank secrecy and the statements of the other bank’s employees were not a sufficient safeguard against a future misuse of the data. The DPA stressed there was no formal relationship between the controller and the other bank, nor internal procedures implemented to handle incidents of that kind. The controller also didn’t prove the knowledge of the other bank’s data protection safeguards in place, especially implemented policies. Hence, the controller had no authority to enforce the statements in practice, and consequently no safeguards to minimise the risk posed by the data breach.

Furthermore, the controller failed to reassess the risk of the data breach, as requested by the DPA. For the DPA the conduct of that kind meant the controller disregarded their duties, especially the duty to protect the data subjects.

The users of the software were offered an option to enrol for research (health-sector studies and statistics) performed by Cegedim and their business partners. In exchange for access to patients’ data, the software users received a discount on the license and access to statistics created by Cegedim.

To enable the transfer of data from the users’ software, Cegedim encrypted patient data and assigned each patient an unique identifier. The identifier informed about the category of doctor visited which made a cross-doctor data examination possible every time the patient visited a same kind of doctor, regardless its location. The patients’ data collected by Cegedim was stored for three months and then transferred to Cegedim business partners.

According to Cegedim, since the patients’ data was anonymised, the GDPR was no longer applicable to the processing at hand.

The French DPA (CNIL) initiated ex officio investigation to examine the practices of Cegedim.","The DPA rejected Cegedim interpretation suggesting they processed anonymised data. Under Recital 26 GDPR, quoted by Cegedim, the pseudonymised data was still personal data covered by the GDPR.  It was clear for the DPA that Cegedim processed personal data which were only pseudonymised. That was because the identifiers assigned to patients’ data allowed Cegedim to identify each patient. Also, as proved during the investigation, it was possible to re-identify a patient using reasonable means and data processed by Cegedim, even without access to additional information. Hence, Cegedim failed to assess the risk of re-identification.

Regarding the nature of Cegedim business activities, the DPA found it was a health database (data warehouse as understood by French doctrine). Furthermore, for the DPA Cegedim was a controller. Cegedim determined the means and purposes of the data processing, including in reference to business relations with healthcare professionals.

The aforementioned facts of the case led the DPA to confirm that Cegedim violated Article 66 of the French Data Procection Act ().

"This decision is the final result of an inquiry launched in April 2019 after Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (MPIL) notified the DPC of the personal data breach. MPIL notified the DPC that it had inadvertently stored passwords of social media users in plaintext on its internal systems without cryptographic protection or encryption.

The DPC press release shows that passwords were not made available to external parties.

The DPC had submitted a draft decision under Article 60 GDPR to the other Concerned Supervisory Authorities across the EU/EEA in June 2024 and no objections were raised by the other authorities.","The DPC found the following violations:

1. Article 33(1) GDPR, for failure to notify the DPC the data breach concerning storage of user passwords in plaintext.  2. Article 33(5) GDPR, for failure to document personal data breaches concerning the storage of user passwords in plaintext.  3. Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, for failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure users’ passwords against unauthorized processing. 4. Article 32(1) GDPR, for failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk including confidentiality of user passwords.

"The DPA carried out the inspections at a Scientific Hospital Care Institute (""controller"") in order to verify compliance with the provisions regarding the protection of personal data in relation to processing carried out for scientific research purposes in the medical, biomedical and epidemiological fields

Two clinical studies were analysed in terms of the following aspects: principles of lawfulness of processing,  transparency to the data subject, retention period of personal data processed, accountability, privacy by design and by default, as well as the obligation to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment, regarding the need and the ideal time to do so.

The first study was related to response and resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy and target therapy in melanoma. The second was about predicting lung disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer using artificial intelligence techniques on clinical and imaging data.","The DPA held that the processing of personal data carried out for medical, biomedical and epidemiological research purposes in particular in study #1 and  study #2, have been performed in breach of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and Article 9(2)(j) GDPR, Article 35 GDPR, Article 12 GDPR, Article 13 GDPR and Article 14(5)(b) GDPR.

The investigation revealed that the consent was collected in an inadequate manner. Such consent was not preceded by a full disclosure of at least its essential elements. In this sense, it was fundamentally flawed from the point of view of specificity and determinacy, according to Article 13 GDPR, and was considered contrary to the principles of transparency and fairness under Article 5(1)(a)GDPR.

The DPA reinforced the importance of carrying out a prior DPIA on the processing of personal data for medical research purposes, in response to the controller's claim that it does so only when the study involves a particular type of profiling of patients' data or if there is an impact on their care through automated processing. In this regard, the DPA reaffirmed that the controller limited the preparation of the DPIA to fewer cases than it should have. The failure to carry out the DPIA beforehand in this case was considered a breach under Article 35 GDPR.

It was also emphasised that the controller has the duty to issue a specific notice in respect of each individual research project, at least in order to provide information different from that already disclosed to the data subjects (Articles 13(3)GDPR and Article 14(5)(b) GDPR.

Another issue highlighted was about the information on the processing of personal data related to study #1 and study #2, that was incomplete. The information gaps highlighted by the DPA refer to the lack of clarity in informing the intention of further processing of the data (Article 13(1) GDPR), lack of indication of the data retention period or the criteria indicated for retention (Article 13 (2)(a) GDPR). Also the rights of data subjects and the possibility to withdraw consent were not clearly represented, as well as the possibility of exercising access to the data provided only at the end of the study. For these reasons it was pointed out that the controller was found to be in breach of the principle of transparency.

The DPA also indicated that the principles of accountability and privacy by design under Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 25 GDPR were violated. The data controller had not, in general terms, demonstrated an active conduct aimed at ensuring by design and by default the effective application of the principles of personal data protection (in particular, of those of lawfulness, fairness and transparency and of data retention limitation) through the implementation and constant review and updating of specific, adequate and measurable proceedings, also in relation to the particular context in which the processing operations examined are carried out and to the related risks for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

The DPA conceded a period of ninety days for the controller to implement corrective measures in relation to:

1) carry out the impact assessment pursuant to Article 35 GDPR; 2) Integrate, amend and rectify the information on the processing of personal data relating to study #1 and study #2; 3) Clearly indicate the legal basis of the processing (Article 13(1)(c) of the Regulation); 4) Indicate the storage period of the personal data or the criteria used to determine it (Article 13(2)(a) GDPR 5) Clearly set out the data subject's rights and the possibility of withdrawing consent; 6) Provide for the possibility to exercise the right of access throughout the duration of the processing.

"Since 2018, the University of Agder (the controller) was using MS Teams and Sharepoint.

The controller’s employee found out that an open MS Teams’ folder gave all the employees and students access to documents contacting personal data. For example, four documents referred to 4,851 employees and 10,419 external persons (back to 2014) who were mentioned by name, national identity number, employee number, resignation date and organisational unit. Moreover, other documents consisted of, for example, an exam overview of 568 students or personal data of 64 Ukrainian refugees.

After receiving the notification from the employee, the controller immediately changed the access setting of the MS Teams’ folders. The new setting required each employee willing to access the folder to be approved by the folder's owner.

The controller notified about the incident under Article 33 GDPR the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) and according to Article 34 GDPR affected data subjects. Additionally, the controller published its detailed description on the controller’s website. However, the log control was limited only to 6 months back. The controller was unable to confirm if the employees and students interacted with or downloaded the data.","The DPA found the controller violated Article 24 and Article 32 GDPR.

The data confidentiality was violated. Personal data became freely available to approximately 1,200 employees and 12,000 students of the controller. Furthermore, the controller had no adequate log control in place, which made it impossible to assess how many people accessed the data. At the same time, the controller failed to implement internal procedures and employees’ training in reference to usage of MS Teams. Also, the initial setting was incorrect, as there was no control over employees accessed to data stored within MS Teams or to discover the unauthorised access in advance.

Hence, the controller failed to implement appropriate security measures in accordance with Article 24 and 32 GDPR, which led to the data breach.

The DPA admitted the controller properly handled the breach and updated the MS Teams settings. Nevertheless, the gravity of the breach, in particular the number of people who potentially had accessed to the data and the categories of data involved required an appropriate reaction of the DPA. The DPA decided then to fine the controller NOK 150,000 (approximately €12,700).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 32"
"The controller, a health authority managing several hospitals and other health facilities, experienced a cyberattack. This led to the unauthorised access to files stored in the controller's servers.

The controller notified the data breach to the DPA in accordance with Article 33 GDPR and to data subjects according to Article 34 GDPR. Moreover, several data subjects filed a complaint with the DPA.

The controller argued that it was in the process of updating its IT system and improving its security measures.","First, the DPA considered that the data breach notification to itself and data subjects was made without an undue delay and, therefore, did not find a violation of Article 33 and 34 GDPR.

However, the DPA noted that the controller did not implement appropriate measures to ensure that it could timely learn about unauthorised accesses to the IT system. Therefore, it found a violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR in combination with Article 32(1) GDPR.

Secondly, the DPA held that the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller to avoid cyberattacks were not adequate. For example, two-factor authentication was not implemented. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR in combination with Article 32(1) GDPR.

"On 6 July 2022, the Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) initiated an investigation on its own against Dansk Retursystem (a controller). The controller is an entity managing the system of cans and bottles deposits - pant. The DPA had been made aware that the controller had developed an application called ""Pant"" (the App) for the payment of deposit. In connection with the App, the controller processed a number of information about, among other things, the users' bank accounts, balances, loans, etc.

The investigation showed that the App had a built-in component allowing a user to log in their bank  to obtain the user's account information in order to pay out money to the right account. The component was made available by a third party and integrated with the App. The component could also collect information about e.g. user's balances, identity information and transaction history. However, this information was not passed on to the controller.

The DPA decided to limit the investigation of the App to the questions of:

(i) whether the controller's processing of personal data in connection with the use of the App took place in accordance with the principles for processing personal data, including the principle of legality, reasonableness and transparency in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the data minimization principle in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR; and

(ii) whether the processing took place in accordance with Article 25 (1) GDPR, as regards the implementation of the data protection principles.

Against this background, the DPA requested the controller for an opinion regarding the App. In his clarifications, the controller affirmed that they have developed the App to modernize the process of deposit payouts, transitioning from physical cards to direct bank transfers. The App required users to register and link a bank account for deposit payments. For this purpose the controller relied on services offered by Tink AB, a payment-service-provider. The controller integrated with Tink's solution to facilitate account selection securely. Tink, acting as a separate data controller initially, gathered extensive data including account numbers, balances, and transaction history, which are crucial for specifying payment details but were not retained by the controller.

To provide flexibility and address operational concerns, the controller introduced a manual option for account linking that bypasses third-party services like Tink. This manual process lacks the validation that comes with the automated system but offers an alternative for users during bank system failures or for those preferring not to use Tink.

The controller emphasized its role as a data controller once account information is received from Tink, responsible for ensuring data processing aligns with GDPR requirements. The App's design focused on minimal data collection essential for its function, avoiding unnecessary storage or processing of sensitive personal information such as addresses or social security numbers.","The DPA highlighted that data controllers developing IT solutions must implement necessary measures to ensure that the processing of personal data adheres to GDPR principles such as legality, transparency, data minimization and data protection by design. They criticized the controller for not implementing necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure that data processing adheres to the principles of data minimization and legality.

In the decision, the DPA seriously criticized the controller for not complying with the rules in these areas. The DPA highlighted that the use of external components like code libraries or APIs should not lead to the processing of unnecessary personal data or obscure the data processing activities from data subjects.

The controller, as the developer of the App, was deemed the data controller, responsible for deciding the purposes and means of personal data processing within the app. This included integrating Tink's API to facilitate bank transactions. Despite Tink also acting as a data controller in its capacity to handle account information, the controller retained joint controllership as it chose to incorporate Tink's services into the app.

Moreover, even if an IT solution included components from external sources, the data controller remained responsible for ensuring all personal data handling complied with GDPR regulations, including Article 25 GDPR, which emphasizes data protection by design and default. Controllers must rigorously assess whether the integration of third-party solutions aligns with GDPR requirements and document compliance accordingly. Also, the lack of direct access to the detailed personal data managed by Tink did not diminish its responsibilities as a joint data controller, underscoring the need for careful design choices to protect data subject rights effectively.

The DPA has issued a warning to the controller to review and modify its data processing practices within the app to ensure that no more data is processed than is necessary and that all data processing is legal, fair, and transparent. The deadline set for compliance is 2 January 2025 at the latest.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25"
"The controller provided remote psychic services via telephone, online chat or text message. On some of its websites, the controller offered personalized chats via telephone carried out by its partner. In order to promote their services, the two companies sent marketing messages to existing and prospective customers via e-mail and text. Prospective customers' contact details were obtained through a contact form on either of the two companies’ websites. The controller and its partner set up a shared database for their marketing purposes which on the 6 October 2022 included personal data of more than 1.5 million people.

On 15 November 2021, the French DPA (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés - CNIL) carried out an online check of five websites run by the controller and its partner. An on-site inspection was also carried out on 7 and 8 December 2021 at the premises of the two companies. The following details the findings of the investigation:

1)	Data retention period proportionate to the purpose of processing under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR

The controller retained the data of its customers for a period of six years after the end of the commercial relationship. The controller argued that this is necessary so that it would be able to respond to possible judicial investigations.

2)	Prior consent to the processing of special category data under Article 9 GDPR

The controller offers users of its website horoscope.fr to fill in a form intended to issue a free prediction about their romantic compatibility with a person of their choice. Users must enter their sex, date, time and city of birth, as well as their e-mail address, but also the sex and date of birth of their partner. During the remote consultations, a plethora of personal information may be disclosed by the customers. These conversations are recorded by the controller's partner and half of the data is stored until the end of the working day and the other half stored for a period of six months.

The controller argued that this sensitive data is not processed but simply recorded.

3)	Processing for marketing purposes under Article L.34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code (Article L.34-5 Code des postes et des communication électroniques)

The notice included on the contact form did not list the controller, nor a list of all other third parties the data is shared with. While users could follow a link which provided some additional information, this link was located much further down on the form. Further, the information included in the link did not mention commercial advertising at all.

During the proceedings the controller changed the format of the contact form to include a very small unintelligible character attached to a word on the form. A click on this character then lead to a footnote which was not visible on the original form listing the controller as the provider of marketing messages.

The controller argued that it would be impossible to provide data subjects with a comprehensive list of recipients as this would breach contractual confidentiality clauses.","1)	Data retention proportionate to the purpose of processing under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR

The CNIL clarifies that while the controller must comply with judicial requests for data, the controller would not face any criminal sanctions if it had deleted data as it was no longer necessary to process it for the controller’s specified purposes. Thus the CNIL did not accept the controller’s argument for warranting the six year storage policy.

As the data is collected for a specific purpose which is the management of the commercial relationship, the CNIL states that as soon as the purpose changes, the controller must take action in differentiating the data. The practice of categorically compiling all customer data into an active database without any differentiation or archiving policy therefore constituted a violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. In relation to the managing of commercial relationships, the CNIL recommended a maximum storage period of three years after the commercial relationship has ended.

2)	Prior consent to the processing of special category data under Article 9 GDPR

The CNIL points out that the mere act of recording the conversations, storing some and deleting others at the end of the day falls under the definition of processing under Article 4(2) GDPR, therefore rejecting the controller’s argument.  Contrary to the provisions of Article 4(11) GDPR, the CNIL notes that the company does not provide any specific information to the data subjects with regard to the collection and processing of data collected from the form on the website and does not explicitly collect their consent for the processing of such data. Similarly, in the context of chat or text consultations, no information on the processing of such data is provided or consent as required under Article 9(2)(a) GDPR obtained.

The CNIL therefore concludes a violation of Article 9 GDPR as the mere willingness to enter information into a form or share personal information through the chat options does not equate to the fully informed consent to the processing of this sensitive data.

3)	Processing for marketing purposes under Article L.34-5 of the Post and Electronic Communications Code (Article L34-5 Code des postes et des communications électroniques)

The CNIL stated that the improvements made to the form still do not meet the required standard of allowing the data subject to easily access a clear description of the marketing purposes and partners as required by the French provision.

4)	Conclusion and setting the fine

The CNIL concluded that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(e) GDPR, Article 9 GDPR and Article 34-5 of the French domestic provision (Article L34-5 Code des postes et des communications électroniques). With reference to the controller’s annual turnover, a €100,000 fine was set for the breaches of the GDPR through Articles 5(1)(e) and 9 GDPR and a €50,000 fine for the breach of Article L.34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9"

"At an unspecified date in the past, the controller installed video cameras within its company premises. Some of the cameras were directly pointed at employees' workspaces. The cameras recorded employees at work and these recordings were accessible to the controller, the manager of the employees, via a mobile phone and also through a website.

The data subjects were not able to access the recordings. There was no clearly visible notice of the video recording in progress placed at the entrance to the workplace. The controller placed a notice on the video recording well within the premises in an obscure place.

The notice of video recording did not contain information on the consequences of the recording, the contact details of the controller, whether information was passed on to third parties nor any of the required information under Article 13(1) GDPR. Moreover, the notice lacked any link to a website where this information could then be found.

The DPA then launched an ex officio procedure against the controller.","The Information Commissioner of the Republic of Slovenia (Informacijski pooblaščenec –IP) held accountable the manager of the company as the controller but also the company as a whole, as represented by the controller.

IP held that the controller had violated Article 76(4) of the Slovenian GDPR implementation law (Zakon o varstvu osebnih podatkov (ZVOP-2)). This article clearly specifies requirements which a notice informing data subjects on video surveillance must contain such as the processing purposes, telephone number or e-mail address or web address for the purposes of exercising the individual's rights in the field of personal data protection or information on specific effects of processing, in particular further processing. None of the requirements were complied with.

All of these requirements were not complied with by the controller and further the IP established that the sole purpose of the video recording was simply to surveil the employees. It stated that if the recording had been for a legitimate purpose such as ensuring the security of the premises, the employees and the business, much less invasive camera placing would have sufficed. The IP explains that cameras at the entrance to the building and at cashier registers would have been adequate. The IP posited that the mere monitoring of employees does not constitute a legitimate ground for processing.

"On March 31, 2020, INPS changed it CDN technology (Content Delivery Network is a system that uses servers located in different places to deliver web content quickly to users around the world) to handle a large number of people accessing its website at the same time, especially important during the high-demand times caused by the COVID-19 pandemic benefits.

However, during the setup, it led to caching errors that allowed unauthorized access to personal data for about 30 minutes. Instead of just showing users their own information, the system ended up showing some user's personal information to others if they visited the website during that time period. This happened because some pages that contained sensitive information were not excluded from caching.

On April 1, 2020, the new system went live, and almost immediately, it was discovered that the system allowed unauthorized access to claims applications. On the same day, INPS notified Garante regarding the CDN data breaches that occurred because of incorrect caching configurations that led to unauthorized access to personal data by displaying cached personal data to other users. This data breach involved personal details displayed on the INPS portal, such as tax codes, names, addresses, and email contacts, among other information.

On April 2, 2020, another breach happened in the context of emergency measures during the pandemic, specifically around the application process for a babysitting service bonus that began on April 1, 2020. Due to the hurried implementation and simplified access measures (like a simplified PIN system), the application procedure did not adequately differentiate between different user types. As a result, some users were wrongly granted access levels typically reserved for authorized intermediaries (like patronages), allowing them to view, modify, or submit applications that contained personal data.

On April 3, 2020, INPS published a notice about the data breach on their homepage and set up a dedicated email for breach reports to manage the situation and communicate with the public.

On April 6, 2020, INPD notified Garante regarding the second data breaches that occurred.

On May 14, 2020, Garante instructed the controller, INPD to notify affected individuals of the data breach.

On July 8, 2020, INPS completed the notification process to the data subject potentially affected by the data breach.","Garante found that INPS had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, violating Article 32 GDPR. Specifically, the misconfigurations in the CDN and the authorization system for the ""Bonus Baby Sitting"" procedure allowed unauthorized access to personal data.

INPS underestimated the risks associated with the data breaches and their potential impact on the rights and freedoms of individuals and this misjudgment led to delays in notifying the affected parties, violating Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

Also, Garante identified that INPS did not promptly notify them or the individuals affected by the breaches, violating Article 33 and Article 34 GDPR.

The breaches demonstrated a failure to comply with several GDPR principles, including the principles of data protection by design and by default, and the principle of ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of personal data, as determined in Article 25 and Article 5(1) GDPR.

Although INPS took steps to address the breaches after they became known, Garante found these measures insufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the breaches effectively.

Because of that, Garante issued a warning to INPS, acknowledging the extraordinary circumstances and the efforts made to address the issues.

"The controller is a subsidiary of Poste Italiane, the main post services company of Italy.

In August 2023, an unauthorised person accessed, through a ransomware cyberattack, the controller’s servers, containing data of the controller’s employees and job applicants (around 25,000 data subjects).

These files, that were afterwards published online on the dark web, contained not only the name, surname and date of birth, but also data related to the trade union membership and health of the data subjects, therefore falling into the scope of Article 9 GDPR, and related to criminal convictions and offences (Article 10 GDPR).

On 17 August 2023, the controller notified the data breach to the DPA.

On 13 October 2023, the DPA requested the controller to provide further details about the data breach, arguing that the first notification was lacking some of the elements provided for by Article 33(3) GDPR.

The controller pointed out that the data breach occurred due to two vulnerabilities in the IT system.","First, the DPA held that the notification was lacking some of the elements provided for by Article 33(3) GDPR. The DPA pointed out that, also according to Recital 87 GDPR, the notification made to the DPA must contain adequate and exhaustive information concerning the data breach. According to the DPA, the purpose of such a notification is to allow the DPA to use its powers and restore a high level of protection of personal data.

In the case at hand, for example, the notification was lacking any information about which servers were impacted and what vulnerabilities were used to access the system. Moreover, the controller did not refer to any measure taken to mitigate the data breach adverse effects, even though this would be required by Article 33(3)(d) GDPR.

Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 33 GDPR.

Second, the DPA noted that the data breach could happen due to two vulnerabilities present in the Microsoft Exchange platform, allowing the unauthorised third party to access the server and set themselves as an admin user.

The DPA also pointed out that Microsoft had reported these vulnerabilities several months before the breach. The same had been done also by the Italian Cybersecurity Agency. However, the controller did not take any action to solve this problem.

The DPA referred to the judgement of the CJEU in case C-340/21, Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite. On the one hand, the DPA pointed out that – as previously noted by the controller – the CJEU had ruled that the simple unauthorised access by a third party is not sufficient to hold that the technical and organisational measures were not appropriate (para. 39; see also C-687/21, MediaMarktSaturn, para. 40).

On the other hand, the DPA noted that in the same judgement, the CJEU ruled that, since the level of protection provided for by the GDPR is dependent on the security measures adopted by controllers, the latter must be encouraged to do everything in their power to prevent the occurrence of data breaches (C-340/21, Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite, para. 55).

According to the DPA, it is apparent that the controller did not do everything in its power, since the vulnerabilities were reported almost 12 months earlier. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(f), 25 and 32 GDPR.

On these grounds, the DPA issued a fine of €900,000 and ordered the controller to implement internal procedures in order to timely detect and solve vulnerabilities in its IT system.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 33"
"An investigation carried out by the DPA showed that the controller had forwarded copies of the identity cards of its employees to a company providing unspecified services for it. These copies contained the data subjects' name, surname, personal identification number, address, ID card number, place of birth and picture.

Moreover, an employee of the controller took pictures of his working computer screen with a personal mobile phone. These pictures contained personal data. This employee then shared these pictures in a WhatsApp group chat. After becoming aware of this data breach, the controller notified the DPA according to Article 33 GDPR.","First, the DPA found that the controller transferred the copies of the ID cards to a third party without a legal basis. Therefore, it found a violation of Article 5(1)(a), 5(2) and 6(1) GDPR.

Second, as for the data breach notified by the controller, the DPA found a violation of Article 32(1)(b), 32(2) and 32(4) GDPR.

"On 14 April 2021, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) received a notification of a personal data breach registered by the controller, a telecommunications provider.

The Security Breach Assessment Report showed that approximately 13,000,000 people were affected by the data breach. The attackers downloaded a database containing the personal data of clients, former clients, suppliers and employees of the controller and published the information on a public website. The personal data included names, ID numbers, postal addresses, email addresses, mobile numbers, nationality, sex, dates of birth, bank account numbers as well as employment details of employees.

The controller stored the data in plain text without any pseudonimisation or anonymisation measures in place.

The controller argued that adequate measures were in place and that the attack could not have been prevented due to the technical expertise of the cyber attackers. Crucially the controller submitted that there is no relationship between the alleged inadequacy and the data breach as more robust measures could not have prevented the attack. Therefore, no causal link could be established between the actions of the controller and the incident. The controller firmly posited itself as a victim of an unforeseen attack and argued that every security system shows room for improvement but that Article 5(1)(f) GDPR cannot be interpreted as an obligation of a specific result.","The AEPD clarifies that Article 5(1)(f) GDPR is violated if there is a personal data breach regardless of whether the breach was caused due to the absence or deficiency of security measures. In its capacity as a controller for large amounts of personal data concerning a large number of people, the controller should have foreseen the risks and implemented measures which could have prevented the cyberattack.

As aggravating factors, the AEPD highlights the amount of personal data leaked and the number of people affected by the breach. Further, it highlighted that a Data Protection Impact Assessment of 2018 which was submitted by the controller, listed precisely those shortcoming in the security system which then enabled the data breach. The failure to remedy these issues over a period of two years clearly demonstrated negligent behaviour on the part of the controller for the AEPD.

Mitigating factors were that the controller drew no benefit from the data breach and that the controller diligently notified the AEPD of the data breach.

The AEPD imposed a fine of €4,000,000 for the infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and a fine of €2,500,000 for the infringement of Article 32 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"Based on media reports published in 2019, the Norwegian DPA became aware of the fact that the controller, a digital engagement platform provider, assumed the GDPR did not apply to its services. The controller had provided Norwegian users with widgets intended for countries where the GDPR does not apply. 

Cookies set by default, tracked users and shared the data with the controller unless users had blocked cookies through their browser settings. The DPA launched an investigation and found that the collected information was used to create interest groups and individual profiling. It further found that the controller had shared the collected data with its parent company. 

The controller denied that it carried out any profiling and called the processing “segmentation”. Further, the controller posited that as soon as it was made aware of the application of the GDPR by notification by the DPA, it erased the personal data of Norwegian users. In addition, the controller argued that the users consent was obtained through the settings the users had determined in their browser.","The DPA held that collection of personal data through the placement of cookies was covered under paragraph 2-7b of the Norwegian Electronic Communications Act (§2-7b Lov om elektronisk kommunikasjon (ekomloven)) the national transposition of the EU e-privacy Directive. 

The DPA determined that processing described as “segmentation” by the controller meets the definition of profiling under Article 4(4) GDPR. However, as the controller had already deleted the data before the investigation commenced, the DPA could not, on the balance of probabilities, determine whether profiling had taken place. 

The further processing of the data collected through cookies was held not to fulfill the requirement of freely given informed consent, even if users had actively disabled the cookie blocking function in their browser. 

Pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR the DPA issued a reprimand to the controller for disclosing personal data to its parent company without a legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR and in breach of the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

The response included a spreadsheet that contained hidden personal data of Council employees, former employees, and associated individuals, such as agency workers. This data included contact details, employment information, salary, health data, gender, and ethnicity.

The breach was only identified on October 27, 2023, five months later, when WDTK notified the Council. At the same time, the Council notified ICO about the data breach.

The Council’s lack of awareness and preparedness for handling hidden data in Excel spreadsheets was highlighted as the primary cause. Staff had not been adequately trained in using Excel’s “Inspect Document” feature, which would have allowed them to check for hidden data before releasing the document.","The ICO acknowledged the Council’s cooperation and transparency during the investigation, as well as the steps taken to mitigate the breach’s impact.

However, due to the initial failure to ensure secure data processing, the ICO issued a reprimand, since the Council's failing to adequately protect sensitive employee data due to insufficient Excel training and awareness, emphasizing the need for improved data handling practices to comply with Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR.

In the reprimand, ICO recommended the implementation of all remedial actions to ensure future compliance and to provide training to all relevant staff on using Excel’s “Inspect Document” feature to prevent similar breaches.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5
"During an inspection carried out on 4th July, 2023, the Police and Labor Inspectorate (Ispettorato Territoriale del Lavoro) found that controller, a bar located in the city of Bologna, had installed 10 surveillance cameras (5 inside and 5 outside the premises) without any information notices informing individuals about the video surveillance.

On 12th March, 2024, the Labor Inspectorate informed the DPA that during their inspection, they found the video surveillance system had been installed without the required legal authorization, violating workers' rights laws.

The video surveillance system was operating without required warning signs informing people they were entering a monitored area. For workplace surveillance, Italian law requires prior Labor Inspectorate authorization or union agreement, which the company did not have at the time of inspection. While the company later obtained the authorization and claimed to have installed warning signs, it provided no evidence of setting up these warning signs.","First, the DPA found that recording individuals without informing them through appropriate signalling violated the transparency principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the information obligations under Article 13 GDPR, and therefore makes the data processing unlawful.

The DPA emphasised that transparency requires individuals to be informed before entering a video-surveilled area through clearly visible signs placed at eye level, in accordance with EDPB Guidelines 3/2019.

The DPA also found that operating workplace video surveillance without prior authorization from the Labor Inspectorate violated Article 114 of the Italian Data Protection Code, which requires compliance with Article 4, L. 300/1970 (Workers' Statute - Statuto dei Lavoratori) for processing employee data.

This data included their name, surname, email, as well as information available in the customer account, such as delivery address, phone number, order history and data related to the cards with which online payments were made.

Moreover, the controller found that similar data (name, surname, phone number, ...) were published online due to a so-called ""credential stuffing"", i.e. an illegal act consisting in using stolen user-IDs and the corresponding passwords in order to get access to the data subjects' account on the controller's platform. This attack involved repeated login attempts on client accounts to place unauthorized gift card orders.

The controller notified these data breaches to the DPA.","The DPA concluded that the controller failed to implement adequate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, violating Article 32(1)(b) and 32(2) GDPR.

On these grounds, the DPA fined the controller RON 99,516 (€20,000) and ordered to adopt the following corrective measures:

* implement new device login alerts, display logged-in devices in accounts, and enforce complex password policies with expiration intervals for all client accounts;
* establish a system to monitor inbound and outbound internet traffic on authentication platforms for all managed e-commerce sites and applications.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"An individual, being a sole entrepreneur (the controller) was attacked with a ransomware software. The attackers encrypted the personal data of the controller’s customers and employees, approximately 200 people. The encrypted data consisted of, in particular, the national identification number (PESEL), name and surname, address, current account number, e-mail and phone number. Shortly after the attack, the controller restored access to the data. The identity of the attackers remained unknown.

The controller indicated that the breach happened due to a human error. Supposedly, one of the controller’s employees turned off the antivirus software. Moreover, the attackers also used the server’s vulnerability. The controller explained that a third party, responsible for the server maintenance and IT services (the processor), failed to update the server’s software for certain time. That made the vulnerability being present when the data breach took place.

The controller notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about the data breach. Due to immediate restoration of data access, the controller found the breach didn’t result in high risk to the data subjects’ rights and freedoms. Allegedly, the attackers’ only purpose was to obtain ransom from the controller in exchange for access to the data, not to access and to share the data. Initially, the controller didn’t notify the data subjects under Article 34 GDPR, because of the technical and organisational measures implemented in response to the breach. Eventually, a month following the DPA notification, the controller notified the data subject by publishing an announcement within their premises.

The DPA found no evidence that the data confidentiality was not affected by the breach. Thus, the DPA ordered the controller to notify the data subjects again. The DPA claimed the original notification was incomplete, as it was lacking, inter alia, contact data of the DPO or the description of measures applied by the controller after the breach.

Moreover, the DPA decided to initiate ex officio proceedings against the controller.

During the proceedings, the controller stated that all the employees underwent training of data protection duties prior to the breach. Moreover, the controller regularly made backups of processed data.","The DPA found the controller had violated the GDPR.

The categories of data processed by the controller required increased data security. Specifically, the controller didn’t introduce measures preventing their IT assets from being infected by the ransomware. For the DPA, such a preventive measure is keeping the software updated.

The controller had not updated the server software for approximately two years. Moreover, the controller failed to regularly test and improve the risk posed by undertaken processing activities. In particular, the DPA emphasised that the controller failed to demonstrate the risk assessment covering potential ransomware attack.

The DPA expressed doubts over the security measures implemented by the controller after the breach. As stated by the DPA, there was no evidence that any security audit of the controller’s IT assets was performed following the breach. Furthermore, the DPA was uncertain whether the controller supervised the implementation of new security measures. At the same time, the DPA noted the lack of a backup management procedure. Consequently, the controller was unable to restore access to the data without undue delay.

Thus, according to the DPA, the controller didn’t perform a risk assessment under Article 32 GDPR neither prior to, nor after the breach. Insufficient security measures in place led to the data breach and subsequent violation of data confidentiality and integrity principles.

Additionally, the controller didn’t verify nor audit how the processor fulfilled their data security and other duties stemming from the GDPR. For the DPA, such an omission amounted to violation of Article 28(1) GDPR. Also, the controller didn’t demonstrate how the processor assisted the controller in maintaining data security under Article 32-36 GDPR. Hence, the processor violated Article 28(3)(f) GDPR and Article 32(2) GDPR.

In addition, the controller violated Article 34(2) GDPR. The controller didn’t provide affected data subjects with enough information, in particular, about the consequences of the breach and available remedies.

In consequence, the DPA found violations of Articles 5(1)(f) GDPR, 5(2) GDPR, 24(1) GDPR, 25(1) GDPR, 28(1) GDPR, 28(3) GDPR, 32(1) GDPR, 32(2) GDPR, 33(3) GDPR and 34(2) GDPR.

"On February 10, 2023, the data subject received an unsolicited promotional call in which the caller identified himself as an employee of a sales organization operating in the telecommunications sector. He offered services for setting up contracts on behalf of various national providers and requested to schedule an appointment with the data subject and a local agent.

The data subject, who was registered in the Registro Pubblico delle Opposizioni (Public Opt-Out Register) to block telemarketing calls, had not provided consent for promotional communications. Also, the data subject independently investigated the organization behind the call and sent two emails to the local agent mentioned in the call to request information about how his data was obtained. The local agent replied denying possession of the data subject's personal data or the use of any marketing tools.

On August 18, 2023, the data subject submitted a formal complaint to the Italian DPA. He highlighted the unsolicited promotional call, lack of consent for the data processing and his registration in the Public Opt-Out Register.

On November 30, 2023, the DPA initiated an inquiry and sent an information request to the local agent, under Article 157 Italian Data Protection Code (Decreto Legislative 196/2003). The local agent responded, claiming the call was commissioned to a Tunisian market research company called Ste Nabi Call and that he had no direct involvement in contacting the data subject and did not possess his personal data.

The DPA sent a second request for clarification, asking the agent to provide details about the service agreement with Ste Nabi Call and clarify the ownership and use of the phone number which called the data subject.

In his response, the agent provided information about the agreement with Ste Nabi Call, stating it was for market research. Also, he denied knowledge of the phone number used for the promotional call.","The DPA concluded that the local agent was the controller and was responsible for ensuring legal compliance, even when outsourcing activities to third parties like Ste Nabi Call.

For this reasons, the DPA issued a reprimand, under Article 58(2)(b) GDPR, establishing a prohibition on further promotional data processing without proper consent and compliance measures, instructions to notify Ste Nabi Call of the data subject's objection to further data processing and a 30-day deadline for the agent to report compliance with these measures to the DPA.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 21, Article 58"

On 16 May 2024, Garante requested the controller to provide clarifications on the complaint, in which they responded claiming that the necessary privacy information was published on the website, but may have been temporarily inaccessible due to technical issues. The website had undergone a complete structural overhaul between late 2023 and May 2024, which could have led to occasional omissions.

On 11 June 2024, Garante formally initiated an investigation, notifying the company of potential violations of Article 5(1), Article 12(1)(2), Article 13 and Article 14.","During the investigation, the Garante confirmed that as of this date, the website lacked the required privacy notices under Articles 13 and Article 14 GDPR, hindering users' ability to exercise their rights.

While acknowledging the violations, the Garante also considered mitigating factors, since the company acted promptly to address the issues once it became aware of them, they had no prior violations of data protection laws and the company cooperated throughout the investigation and provided clarifications.

"In this case the controller is Foodinho a food delivery company managing the service “Glovo” in Italy. This company is owned by Glovoapp23 SA, a Spanish holding. The DPA started its investigation following the death of one of its employees while he was delivering food.

The controller uses an online platform provided by Glovo ES (appointed as processor) to manage its employees and the deliveries. This platform allows to see a map of every place in the World where Glovo operates and the live location of each employee. The controller, by clicking on a “rider”, can view their location, the time slots in which they are available, the deliveries they performed and the track they followed.

The investigation showed that this geolocation function was active, in some cases, even outside working hours and when the app was not active. Moreover, the controller implemented a facial recognition function for identity verification purposes, provided by a processor, Jumio Corporation. According to this procedure, the data subjects (employees) needed to upload an ID card and take a selfie of themselves. After that, the data subjects were asked to take a selfie in random occasions. If they refused to do so, their possibility of getting further delivery time slots was blocked.

The controller argued that this processing was necessary to comply with Article 23 of the applicable collective agreement, stating that it’s forbidden for the employees to be replaced by a third party.

Furthermore, the investigation showed that the controller’s software allowed to rate the data subjects. The controller argued that this rating function is not active for Italy.","The DPA considered that the data processing is made by Foodinho, who fits the definition of controller as it decides the purposes and means of processing, as laid out in the privacy notice given to riders and in the contract with GlovoApp 23 SA. The case at hand does not concern a cross-border data processing activity as the data processing happened in the context of contracts stipulated by an Italian entity, having legal autonomous legal personality and registered in Italy. Thus the Italian DPA is competent to rule on this matter.

Violation of Article 5(1)(a), (c) and (d) GDPR and of Article 25 GDPR

Once notified of the death of the rider, even if the controller set the status of the rider as “disabled” with an explicit note in description, an automatic notification of dis-activating of the account was sent. The automatic notification was considered a mistake due to human error. The DPA found that the notification was not due to human error as, even if the deactivation of the account was done manually after the rider´s death, the message sent automatically is a product of the system settings of the company. Such automatic sending violates Article 5(1)(a), (c) and (d) GDPR and of Article 25 GDPR.

Violation of Article 13 GDPR

The DPA considered that the data processing, through the automatic and independent sending of a message without regards to the concrete circumstances of the deactivation of the account, shows that the controller did not put into respect the relevant data protection principles.  Article 13 GDPR was violated as the controller failed to produce the relevant documents and, contrarily to what was claimed, did not use a “layered approach” to the provision of information. In fact, the absence of a coherent layered approach, as well as the lack of coordination between the different documents provided made it impossible to the requesting parties to have a clear overview of the types of data processing that the controller puts into place on personal data. Thus, as the controller did not provide information in a complete manner and did not provide them in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, the DPA found a violation of Article 13 GDPR.

Violation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR

The controller put forward four versions of their data privacy notice from 13-14 December 2022 to 29 February 2024. All of these versions present the same points of concern:

-	The controller did not indicate specifically the categories of data that the controller processes, such as those related to handling orders chat and emails between riders and customer care.

-	Different legal basis are mentioned even if, at point 4, the main legal basis is “processing necessary for the performance of a contract” as per Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.

-	With regards to geolocation, vague legal bases like “fight against terrorism”, “money laundering” and “crimes against public health” were used, even if no reference to them is made anywhere else. In fact, the formulation of the notice does not allow to understand the scope of processing of geolocation data. While it is stated that the controller can process such data only when the rider activates the geolocation function while working, in practice the investigation found that GPS is active even when the app is in the background and, until August 2023, even when the app was closed.

Violation of Article 28 GDPR

A violation of Article 28 GDPR was found due to the designation of riders as “processors”. This is unlawful as in concreto, riders do not have the characteristics to fulfil that definition.

Violation of Article 5, 22(3) and 25 GDPR

The presence of automated decision making processes, such as the “excellence system”, the “shift assignment”, the “rating” of riders, the “deactivation and blocking of accounts” as well as absence of appropriate safeguard measures, brought forward a violation of Articles 5, 22(3) and 25 GDPR.

Violation of Article 5(1)(a) and 9(2)(b) GDPR

A violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 9(2)(b) GDPR was found due to the linking of the processing of biometric data to the access to the rider´s account as well as the access to the available shifts.

Violation of Article 35 GDPR

Furthermore, the DPA considered that the controller failed to take into account the results of the already made DPIAs, i.e. the one dated October 2020 and the one of February 2024, as per Article 35 GDPR. The fact that the DPIA does not take into account the lawfulness requirement, especially with regards to the processing of biometric data in the context of employment relations.

Violation of Article 32 GDPR

Article 32 GDPR was also violated as, during investigations it emerged that operators of controllers can access to personal data of riders working for other enterprises belonging to the Glovo group and active in different countries, both in and outside the EU.

Violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR

Additionally, the DPA considered that Article 5(1)(e) GDPR was violated as the controller stores for 36 months the recordings of cellphone calls with riders. The grounds behind such processing are, according to the DPA, not aligned with such a long retention period.

Violation of Article 5(1)(c), 6, 13, 14 and 25 GDPR

The DPA also found that the controller shared personal data of the riders with third parties, among which Google Firebase, Braze and mParticle. This sharing violated Articles 5(1)(c), 6, 13, 14 and 25 GDPR.

Violation of Article 5(1)(a) and 88 GDPR

Finally, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 88 GDPR as the modalities through which the controller organizes and handles its delivery service, i.e. the geolocation policy and assignment of shifts based on the “excellence” ranking are not “inextricably linked” to the activity but instead simply part of the organizational model chosen by the controller. To further confirm this, the DPA explicated that no element proves that the tasks of riders cannot be fulfilled without the technological instruments and modalities used by the controller.

Imposition of a fine

Given the continuous duration of the violations, the extent of data subjects involved, the malicious character of the breach, the aggravating factor of having had a former decision and the level of gravity of the damage to data subjects in question, the DPA deemed it appropriate to impose a fine of €5,000,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 14, Article 22, Article 25, Article 28, Article 32, Article 35, Article 88"

The information was contained in a summary statement of a meeting between BCTCIC and West Midlands Police, the full statement was copied verbatim into the CP Plan which was then approved and sent to a family by the CP&R department.

The CP Plan was received and read by the recipient subsequently resulting in inappropriate access to both sensitive criminal data, specifically criminal allegations and the personal identifiers of an individual under the age of 18.","The ICO determined that BCTCIC were responsible for certain infringements of the UK GDPR resulting in a personal data breach in relation to Article 5(l)(f) UK GDPR and Articles 32(1)(b,) and 32(2) UK GDPR.

"The Swedish DPA started an investigation, following a tip to local medias, stating that employees of the security company Verisure, the controller, unlawfully shared footage from cameras in private individuals´ homes between themselves.

The controller started an internal investigation and found no indication of improper sharing of personal customer information as described by the tip. Moreover, it considered that there is no evidence suggesting ongoing or current violations of the international regulations.

More specifically, the image material was available to authorised personnel in the company´s system for a specific amount of time, and was subsequently archived for a certain period of time, to be able to share images with law enforcement authorities. The controller specified that the footage is stored for exactly the needed time to comply with the purposes of the processing. Additionally, all image views require logging in with specific credentials, making it impossible to export them outside of the controller´s system.","First, as to the type of log in information, the DPA found that there was no issue with the technical measures in place in the controller´s systems.

Second, the DPA highlighted the gravity of processing data subjects´ pictures for amusement purposes and its noncompliance with Article 6 GDPR. However, nothing emerged to indicate that the alleged unlawful handling of image material has taken place.

The DPA further ascertained the existence of appropriate measures as per Article 32(1) GDPR. Since the controller processes personal data of a large number of data subjects and the fact that such processing happens in the context of an alarm management service, the data processed is of a very privacy-sensitive nature. Moreover, data subjects expect a high degree of confidentiality and protection against unlawful or unauthorised processing. These elements point out that the controller shall implement measures that counter this high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects through a high level of data protection.

In light of the above, the DPA considered whether such high level of data protection was in place. The DPA found that the controller did not take the appropriate technical and organisational measures as it did not store the log data on file names long enough to allow tracing of any mismanagement of the personal data related to the images from customers´ cameras.

Specifically, a midwife sent an email containing this form to another IVF patient, who replied within one hour to receive an empty form. The midwife promptly requested the deletion of the mistakenly-sent form and informed the controller about what happened. The patient who mistakenly received the form confirmed the deletion of the form to the controller. The controller considered the information in the form emailed to the wrong patient to constitute sensitive data under Article 9 GDPR.

The controller argued that the violation was due to mere human error and that the midwife attended a privacy course from an external consultancy agency. Moreover, as the receiving patient notified the controller and deleted the wrongfully sent file within two hours, the effects of the data breach were limited. The controller moreover adopted the appropriate safeguards and technical measures required under Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR, which in the case at hand were not in place because the form was supposed to be empty.","The DPA considered that the episode was an isolated one that resulted in no harm, as confirmed by the lack of the data subject´s complaint.

A customer, the data subject, complained about a loan taken in its name, which started an internal investigation. Such investigation revealed that an employee of the controller unlawfully used the data subject’s personal data collected in the context of a prior application which was however withdrawn by the data subject.

Moreover, the controller’s employee withdrew cash, conducted bank transfers on behalf of several data subjects, changed contact details, operated Smart banking operations without data subjects’ consent, and, during this process, affected multiple categories of personal data.

In this context, the controller also admitted that two employees sent confidential information about a data subject’s transaction on Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp to a former employee, who subsequently shared it to the data subject’s relatives.","The DPA considered that the controller did not implement sufficient measures to ensure that any employee having access to personal data does not process them except at the controller’s request. In fact, it was the lack of measures that led to the unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure of personal data transmitted, stored or processed.

Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 32(1)(2) and Article 32(4) GDPR and, as such breaches happened between 2015 to beginning of 2023 deemed it appropriate to fine the controller RON 99,466 (€20,000).",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32

This contract will last for three years and entails a remuneration that GEDI will receive upon sharing editorial content with OpenAI.

OpenAI in turn commits to use such content to allow users to do real-time research, and to have available a summary right away, comprising a hyperlink to such news.

A DPIA was conducted and transmitted to the Italian DPA stating that the data processing will happen on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, namely the legitimate interest to exercise the profession of journalist in innovatively.","The DPA started this ex officio procedure on the basis of Article 58(1)(a) GDPR due to some alarming preliminary considerations.

First, the party to the contract with the controller is OpenAI OpCo LLC, while according to the contract the data will be shared to OpenAI Ireland Ltd. Moreover, the contract is made with GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A., however the editorial content referred to belong to subsidiaries to GERI.

Second, the legal basis for the processing, namely the transfer of data from GEDI to OpenAI, was Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. However, considering that the data processing will be of “large scale” and of “particular nature”, the DPIA did not sufficiently consider this in the context of Article 9 and 10 GDPR.

Third, it is unclear how the claimed legal basis would also be relevant to train OpenAI’s artificial intelligence operations.

Fourth, the transparency requirements as per Article 13 and 14 GDPR were not met.

"On the 25 June 2018, the Irish DPA (Data Protection Commission - DPC) began an ex-officio investigation into the controller, a local County Council (Sligo).

The controller had installed CCTV cameras at bottle banks and in housing estates stating that they were to aid the enforcement of the Irish Litter Pollution Act 1997 and to help detect anti-social behaviour. The cameras therefore constantly filmed public and private areas This video footage was then stored by the controller. The controller could not demonstrate any records of logs regarding the data processing and it was unclear for how long the data was stored.

The cameras, as they were installed in public spaces filmed passers-by and individuals using nearby facilities such as a community centre. Some of the monitoring screens were in public spaces (such as the community centre) and could therefore be accessed by unauthorised persons. One CCTV footage monitor was not password protected while another had the capability to log all access to the system but staff had not been trained to use this function.","The DPC found that the use of the CCTV cameras at the bottle banks could not be justified under the Litter Pollution Act 1997 nor the Waste Management Act 1996. Article 8(2) of the Law Enforcement Directive does not provide for such a broad scope of CCTV footage to be processed. Therefore, the Law Enforcement Directive only applied to some of the processing.

The DPC found a total of 14 issues throughout the course of the inquiry ranging from unlawful processing to failing to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment. The DPC found violations of the GDPR as well as the Irish Data Protection Act 2018 which transposes the GDPR into national law.

The DPC found the following violations of the GDPR showing negligence on the part of the controller:

For failing to ensure the appropriate security of the CCTV monitoring screens, the controller had breached Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32(1) GDPR. The DPC highlighted that passers-by could easily take pictures of what was being shown on the monitoring screens.

For excessively monitoring and processing footage of public spaces the DPC found violations of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and Article 25 GDPR in relation to the purposes. The DPC highlighted that the controller could have implemented ""privacy masking"" so that private areas would not be recorded by the cameras.

For retaining the data for longer than necessary the DPC found a violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR.

For failing to set up and maintain records of the processing, the DPC found a violation of Article 30 GDPR.

For failing to erect signage informing of the processing and failing to be able to explain a reason for this, the DPC found a violation of Article 13 GDPR.

The DPC issued a fine of €29,500 for the violations and ordered the controller to bring its data processing into compliance.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, Article 30"
"After a Belgian journal published an article on the data sharing from Freedelity to other brands, the Belgian DPA started an investigation.

Freedelity, the controller, is a company offering technological means to simplify the shopping experience of consumers, by collecting and storing the personal data present in Belgian electronic ID cards. This allows to centralise the commercial information and offers from different brands to consumers, such as loyalty cards and background log information of previous purchases. The data processed is stored in a central filing system, accessible to other brands other than only the controller.

Three main points were raised in the investigation. First, the collection of personal data, more specifically identification data and contact data. Second, the sharing of such personal data. Third, the transfer of personal data stored in the central filing system to third parties.","The DPA started its decision by explaining which type of data processing happened. First, there was a collection of personal data, not only directly from the clients through the scanning of their electronic ID, but also by the controller, both through its application and website, including its cookies, and by subscriptions to the central filing system. Second, there has been sharing of personal data between the controller and other companies, where the controller shared and updated all personal data of customers subscribed to the controller´s service, in exchange for advertisement of the controller´s website.

The court found that the data collection and sharing are two inextricably linked practices as the purpose of data collection from electronic IDs is to allow the constant growth of the central filing system.

Therefore, the DPA considered it appropriate to examine whether or not the controller and the companies providing the other brands acted as joint controllers in the context of this decision. The DPA considered the determination of, first, the purposes of processing; and, second, of the means of processing. The purpose was found to be the data collection and processing, which is shared between the controller and the other brands. Similarly, the means are shared, with the controller collecting personal data from their website and app, and the other brands advertising this service. In light of this, the controller and the other brands were considered joint controllers as per Article 26 GDPR.

Violation of Articles 5(2) and 7 GDPR

With regards to the lawfulness of the legal basis, the DPA found that a violation of Article 5(2) and 7 GDPR existed as the consent collected by the joint controllers was not “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes”.

Violation of Articles 5(2), 7(3), 24 and 25 GDPR

Additionally, the DPA considers that the joint controllers did not respect the documentation requirements and liability arising from Articles 24 and 5(2) GDPR in matter of withdrawal of consent, as current mechanisms do not allow for a withdrawal of consent that is both simple and direct as required by Article 7(3) GDPR, in accordance with the principle of data protection by design under Article 25 GDPR.

Violation of Articles 5(1)(c) and 25(1) GDPR

A violation of the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and of data protection by default under Article 25(1) GDPR was found as data concerning the municipality of issue of the identity card, the date of validity of the identity card and the history of this data has been collected, even if the DPA finds that it has no relevance in the framework of the processing carried out by the joint controllers.

Violation of Articles 5(1)(e), 5(2), 24 and 25(1) GDPR

Finally, the DPA found that a violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR, namely the storage limitation principle, as it established a data storage period of 8 years, which is too long, and also does not have in place a good storage system to keep the data subject´s data safe from third party interventions.

Reprimand

In the case at hand, as per Article 100 of the Belgian LCA, the DPA considered it sufficient to reprimand the controller, but also imposed a deadline of four months to correct these GDPR violations. After those 4 months, a €5,000 daily fine will be imposed.

Among the available corrective measures, the DPA required Freedelity, (a) to put into place mechanisms so that the data collection is based on freely-given, specific, univocal consent, (b) implement simple, accessible and direct technical and organisational measures to permit data subjects to give their consent, (c) to properly document the data collection process and (d) to stop the collection and processing of personal data from electronic ID cards, except in the context of processing made with the objective of having access to a classic fidelity program.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 7, Article 24, Article 25, Article 26"
"On 16 September, Telefonica Espana, the controller, detected a data breach caused by a cyberattack. The personal data of two subsidiary companies of the controller, Movistar and O2 were affected. The personal data accessed comprised phone number, technical data from wifi connections and routers as well as account access credentials (username and password). The database which was compromised included data on more than a million customers. The database was used to manage its customers’ wifi routers (“eDomus portal”).

There had been up to 4 million access requests to the internal system of the controller per day from a single employee in Lithuania. The usual number of access requests was at 55,000 per day. This was detected on the 16 September 2022. However, the employees credentials weren’t blocked until four days later on the 20 September 2022, as they had been on holidays and only then could confirm that they were not making these requests. Subsequent to the employee’s statement, the controller investigated the incident.

Subsequent to the detection of the data breach, the controller appealed to its customers to change their passwords. The controller denied responsibility for the cyberattack as it was unforeseen. Crucially, it made the argument that the data leaked was not sensitive data or of major importance as it mainly comprised technical data. Further, the controller disputed that a landline number were personal data.","The AEPD concluded that the controller had failed to comply with the risk based approach to data security and the principle of accountability. The controller had acted seriously negligent in light of the amount of personal data processed and the amount of people affected which were 1,407,257.

The AEPD rejected the controller’s argument that a landline number cannot be personal data. It further rejected the controller's argument that the data leaked was not of vital importance and held that the leaked data could lead to a total loss of control and further that it could be used to commit offences such as theft, identity fraud or other financial crimes. The AEPD highlighted that if the controller had implemented two-step verification to access the database, a very common measure, the cyberattack could have been prevented.

The AEPD set a fine of €800,000 for in general processing data without ensuring adequate security under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. Further, the AEPD set a fine of €500,000 for failing to apply technical and organisational measures which would have minimised the cyberattack risk under Article 32 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"

Clyde Valley Housing Association released a new customer portal. The portal went live on 14 July 2022. On the same date, a resident logged into the portal and found that they were able to view personal information about other residents. The resident called Clyde Valley Housing Association and spoke to a customer service advisor, and told them that they could see information that they felt they shouldn’t have been able to see. The customer service advisor who received the call then failed to escalate this concern, which led to this data remaining viewable on the portal for a further 5 days until further residents reported the issue and Clyde Valley Housing Association suspended the portal.","Following an investigation, the Commissioner issued a reprimand to Clyde Valley Housing Association in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), having determined that Clyde Valley Housing Association failed to carry out adequate testing prior to the online customer portal going live, leading to accidental access of personal information  due to a lack of appropriate technical measures. This demonstrated a failure to keep residents data secure against unauthorised processing, and as a result was an infringement of Article 5(1)(f) of the UK GDPR.

"In September 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) launched two inquiries into data processing activities of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, here the controller.

In July 2017, Meta implemented a so-called “View-as” function on Facebook which allowed users to see their own Facebook page as it would appear to another user. The function included a video upload feature which created so-called “user tokens”. User tokens are coded IDs which are used to verify users and can control access to platform features as well as personal data. Users could therefore use these tokens to gain access to other accounts.

Between the 14 and 18 September 2018, third parties caused a major data breach by using the tokens to log on as other Facebook account holders. The data breach impacted approximately 29,000,000 Facebook users globally of which 3,000,000 were based in the EU/EEA.

Meta employees became aware of the data breach through an unusual increase in video uploads and removed the function shortly after.","Decision one: Documentation concerning the data breach

The DPC found that Meta had violated Article 33(3) GDPR for failing to include necessary information in their data breach report. For this violation, the DPC issued a reprimand and set an administrative fine of €8,000,000.

"Energya VM received several complaints from data subjects alleging they had been contacted by Nivalco, which offered energy services. The individuals making these calls had access to the customers' personal data. In response, Energya VM held a meeting with Nivalco to clarify the purpose of the calls and the discounts being offered. An internal audit revealed that most of the calls targeted customers who had canceled their agreements within the initial days of the contract. Under their contractual arrangement, Nivalco was responsible for promoting Energya VM’s services and managing a database containing the personal information of individuals and businesses for marketing purposes.

Energya VM claimed it was not involved in compiling this database and only accessed personal data when an individual entered into an agreement for energy services.

On May 9, 2023, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) initiated an investigation into alleged violations of Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. Energya VM denied responsibility for Nivalco’s data processing practices, asserting that Nivalco independently obtained and managed the personal data and autonomously decided its use. Energya also argued that its lack of access to the database prevented effective supervision. However, during its investigation, the AEPD found that Energya VM had provided Nivalco with instructions regarding the processing of personal data, undermining Energya’s claims of non-involvement. Energya VM was deemed the data controller. The contractual relationship between Energya VM and Nivalco ended on May 28, 2020.","The AEDP determined that Energya VM violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, as well as Article 5(2) GDPR.

• Article 5(1)(a) GDPR:  The facts indicate that the processing of personal data was neither lawful nor transparent, as Energya VM was aware that Nivalco was using the data in a manner that misled customers. Energya VM provided Nivalco with a sales script for the calls, which violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by failing to clarify how the personal data was being used. As a result, Energya VM was deemed the data controller, with Nivalco acting as the data processor.

• Article 5(2) GDPR: Energya VM, as the data controller, failed to conduct a prior risk assessment regarding Nivalco's processing of personal data. Although the data processor provided a declaration asserting that all personal data in its database was lawfully obtained, they admitted that their employees contacted customers while posing as the data controller. The origin of the personal data (including full names, business names, and phone numbers) remains unclear. Additionally, the data processor had knowledge of the customers' current energy suppliers. As the data controller, Energya was obligated to adopt proactive measures to verify the lawful origin of the data but instead acted reactively. This lack of due diligence further compounded the violation of GDPR requirements.

As a result, the AEPD upheld fines of €2,500,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and an additional €2,500,000 for the violation of Article 5(2) GDPR.

Furthermore, the AEPD directed Energya VM  to take the following actions within nine months, in accordance with Article 58(2)(d) GDPR:

•	Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of their processes for collecting and handling personal data.

•	Implement technical and administrative safeguards to ensure GDPR compliance in the processing and handling of personal data.

"Unicredit Consumer Financing, the controller, notified the DPA about a data breach in line with its obligations under Article 33 GDPR. This data breach included the name, surname, position, signature of their former employees, the data subjects.

The controller reported that the data was included in certain contractual documents and used in relationships with clients and collaborators, even after employment contracts had been terminated.

The Romanian DPA started an investigation on the matter.","The DPA found that the controller processed the data subject´s data due to an operational error which led to the use of versions of documents with outdated signatories. Thus, the controller violated the principles laid out in Article 5(1)(a), (f) and (2) GDPR and Article 32(4) GDPR.

The controller also failed to provide a legal basis for the processing of such data and thus violated Article 6(1) GDPR.

Therefore, the DPA deemed it appropriate to impose a fine of RON 24,885 (€5,000).

"On 20 March 2023, a technical bug on the ChatGPT service caused users to view the chat history of other users instead of their own for a limited amount of time. The controller, OpenAI, publicly acknowledged the issue and confirmed that the exposed data included names, surnames, email addresses, and the last four digits and expiration dates of credit cards used for the ChatGPT Plus (the paid version of the service).

Following this data breach, the Italian DPA started an ex officio investigation.","First, the DPA considered whether the one-stop-shop mechanism would apply. More specifically, the DPA considered that, at the time of the alleged violations, the controller was established in California and did not have any indicated establishment in the EU. In fact, ChatGPT has been available in the EU since 30 November 2022, as also confirmed by the controller. The controller had an establishment in Ireland only from the 15 February 2024. Therefore, the DPA found that, for every alleged violation of the GDPR happened before the 15 February 2024, the one-stop-shop mechanism does not apply and the DPA has jurisdiction to rule on the matter.

Second, the Italian DPA concluded its investigation and held that:

Violation of Article 33(1) GDPR

The controller is under the obligation to notify any data breach to the DPA within 72 hours according to Article 33(1) GDPR. The controller states that it notified the data breach to the Irish DPA, as it was in the process of setting up its Irish registered office when the breach happened.

The DPA considered that, during the breach, the controller was based in the U.S.A and did not have any establishment in the EU. The DPA highlighted that, where a proprietor does not have an establishment in the EU, Article 56 GDPR does not apply in favour of the general rule laid out in Article 55(1) GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority is competent to execute the tasks assigned to it and to exercise the powers conferred upon it under the GDPR in the territory of the respective Member State.

The DPA further considered that the decision could not be transferred to the Irish DPA as the alleged violations happened before the establishment for the controller in Ireland.

Thus, the controller violated Article 33(1) GDPR, as it failed to notify the Italian DPA, instead of the Irish one.

Violation of Articles 5(2) and 6 GDPR

The DPA considered that, in relation to the data processing to train the models underlying the ChatGPT service, that the data processing started much earlier than the service they were intended for. This means that, during that period, the controller should have defined the legal basis for such processing, which it did not. This is in line with Article 5(2) GDPR establishing the accountability principle of the controller.

Considering that the controller failed to correctly identify an adequate legal basis before the data processing took place, they violated Article 6(1) GDPR.

Violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 12 and 13 GDPR

When analyzing the controller´s privacy policy, the DPA found that twp types of data processing: the processing of users´ data to be able to use the controller´s service, and the processing of non-users´ data to train the models underlying the ChatGPT service.

The GDPR, under Article 5, as well as Article 12 and 13, establishes some transparency obligations in this regard, namely that both users, as well as third parties whose data is being used, are correctly informed of the processing. The DPA found that various elements indicate that these obligations were not respected: first, the privacy policy was only available in English; and, second, it was not easily reachable on the controller´s website.

From a content standpoint, the privacy policy did not contain any information about the data processing of non-users´ data, that are used to train the models underlying the ChatGPT service.

Therefore, the controller violated Article 5(1)(a), Article 12 and Article 13 GDPR.

Violation of Article 24 and 25 GDPR

The DPA recalled that Recital 38 GDPR highlights the need for specific protection of minor´s data protection. As per Article 24(1) GDPR, the controller should put into place adequate technical and organizational measures. Moreover, Article 25 GDPR highlights that the controller must adopt such measures taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation, as well as the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks having different probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing.

The controller did not implemented any mechanism to verify the age of users when registering for the ChatGPT service, even though the terms of service conditions of service (ToS) identified minors among potential users, stating that, for the purposes of a valid contractual relationship contractual bond, users aged between 13 and 18 require the consent of the holder of parental responsibility.

The documentation on file shows that the controller has expressed its commitment to consider the implementation of age verification mechanisms only following the corrective measure imposed by the DPA decision no. 9874702.

Moreover, the DPA considered that the corrective measures imposed on the 11 April 2023 in the context of the DPA decision no. 9874702, were disregarded by the controller.

Therefore, the controller violated Articles 24 and 25 GDPR.

Violation of Article 5(1)(d) GDPR

The DPA found various issues related to the accuracy of the data prompted out by ChatGPT. This raises questions as per the compliance of ChatGPT with Article 5(1)(d) GDPR. However, considering that such questions of accuracy are yet to be resolved, and thus ongoing after the date 14 February 2024, the DPA found it appropriate to apply the one-stop-shop mechanism and refer such questions to the Irish DPA.

Use of Article 166(7) of the Privacy Code

The DPA exercised for first time its new powers under Article 166(7) of the Privacy Code and ordered OpenAI to carry out a six-month institutional communication campaign aimed at enhancing transparency in the processing of personal data. The campaign, which must be broadcast across radio, television, newspapers, and the internet, will focus on informing the public about ChatGPT's data practices, specifically the collection of both user and non-user data for AI model training. The content of the campaign, to be agreed upon with the Authority, must educate individuals about their rights under the GDPR, including the right to object, rectify, and delete personal data. The goal is to enable users and non-users to better understand how to exercise their rights and to oppose the use of their data for training generative AI models.

Imposition of a fine

In light of the aforementioned violations, the Italian DPA imposed a fine of € 15,000,000 on OpenAI, for the numerous violations of the GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 8, Article 13, Article 14, Article 33, Article 55, Article 56"
"KASPR runs a Chrome browser extension which allows users to get the business details of people whose LinkedIn profile they had visited. On the 28 July 2022, the French DPA (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés – CNIL) carried out a compliance check with KASPR, the controller.

The investigation showed that approximately 160 million contacts were included in the controller’s database. These entries included the surname, first name, e-mail address, telephone number, LinkedIn profile URL or other social networks, employer, company, job title, skills, professional interest, career, date of hiring and end of post, training, place of work, source of data and date of collection.

Harvesting the data from LinkedIn and storage

On LinkedIn, users can choose between four different visibility options: 1 – Only visible to me, 2 – Anyone on LinkedIn, 3 – 1st degree connections and 4 – 1st and 2nd degree connections.

The controller collected the contacts details of LinkedIn users who had made their details visible to all (Option 2) as well as those whom had limited the visibility to 1st and 2nd degree connections (Options 3&4).

Providing information

Four years after the implementation of the KASPR tool, the controller notified data subjects by sending an email which informed them of the practice and gave the option to object to the processing by clicking on a link in the email.  When data subjects filed access requests under Article 15 GDPR, the controller merely responded that their personal information was retrieved from publicly available sources.

The controller’s argument

The controller argued that the processing is based on its legitimate interest to facilitate connection between working professionals aligning with the intentions of data subjects active on LinkedIn. Further, it argued that identity verification should reasonably be expected by users of a professional networking service and that data was collected according to the selected options on LinkedIn.","No legal basis under Article 6 GDPR

The CNIL found that the processing of personal data taken from LinkedIn users who had limited their visibility lacked a legal basis. The CNIL highlighted that users who had selected options 3 and 4, had expressly limited the visibility of their contact details. The mere fact that users had limited and not entirely denied access to their contact details did not provide authorisation for the controller to harvest this data as users could not reasonably expect for this processing to occur.

No clear data retention period adhered to under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR

The CNIL found that the controller's storage limitation policy entailed an automatic extension of the storage period  and potentially led to an indefinite storage of personal data without a clear set storage limitation. According to the CNIL, this was not proportional and did not meet the requirements under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR.

Failure to provide adequate transparency under Article 12 GDPR and information under Article 14 GDPR

In addition to the fact that the controller had only informed data subject’s four years after it had begun processing their personal data, the CNIL criticised that the controller sent the email exclusively in English.

Failure to provide access to data under Article 15 GDPR

The CNIL found that the controller did not provide all available information as to the source of the data. Even if the controller could not trace the specific source of the data for each data subject, it was found to have been aware of some sources and should have disclosed these. The CNIL further criticised that these sources were not listed in the privacy policy.

For the above breaches of the GDPR, the CNIL issued a fine of €240,000. The CNIL ordered the company to rectify its data processing within a six-month period (before the 18 June 2025). Specifically it ordered the controller to:

* Stop collecting the data of LinkedIn users who had selected to limit the visibility of their contact details and to delete this data. If the controller cannot identify which users had limited their data visibility, it should inform all data subjects of the processing and the option to object to it within three months. The CNIL specified that the collected data must only be used for this purpose.
* Cease the automatic renewal of the storage period pending a personal data update. 
* Inform data subjects of the processing in a language they understand.
* Adequately respond to access requests and include all available information on the source of the personal data collected.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 12, Article 14, Article 15"
"A university hospital, the controller, experienced a ransomware attack by the ""Ragnar Locker"" group. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the controller's firewall to obtain domain credentials belonging to a supplier.

Using these compromised credentials and a VPN connection, the attackers performed lateral movements (i.e. they moved sideways from device to app and so forth to explore infected networks to find vulnerabilities, escalate access privileges, and reach their ultimate target) within the network and  eventually gained access to the controller's shared file server, which, although intended only for administrative documents, contained various files including health data.

The attackers successfully exfiltrated data to servers in the Netherlands and established a backdoor Secure Shell (SSH) connection. They disabled the antivirus system and deployed executable code that spread ransom notes across workstations, though they did not encrypt the data. The controller promptly notified the DPA about the breach.","First, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR (integrity and confidentiality principle) and Article 32 GDPR by failing to implement adequate measures to detect data breaches promptly. The controller lacked a proper log management system that could have enabled early detection of the suspicious activities that preceded the attack.

Second, the DPA found that the controller's network security measures were insufficient. The authority noted several critical vulnerabilities: the network had no segmentation, VPN access lacked multi-factor authentication, maintenance accounts used shared administrator credentials, and approximately 130 users possessed maximum administration rights. Additionally, the controller continued to run obsolete communication protocols.

The DPA considered several mitigating factors under Article 83(2) GDPR: the controller's prompt breach notification, full cooperation during the investigation, implementation of significant security improvements following the attack, and the challenging circumstances of operating during the pandemic period.

However, given that health data under Article 4(15) GDPR was compromised, the authority classified the violation's severity as high.

Based on these findings, the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €25,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 32, Article 33"
"On 28 September 2022, the local police force of the city of La Palma submitted a report to the Spanish DPA (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos – AEPD).  The police had discovered 1,404 letters on an abandoned plot of land. The letters should have been delivered by Correo Inteligente Postal, here the controller. The letters had been sent off between February and May 2022.

On the 17 November 2022, the AEPD received another report from the police force of the Balearic islands showing that 5,354 letters were left in two different locations in the city of Palma. The police had been informed by a citizen who had sent an email to the city stating that they had found letters in the city’s river. The documentation provided by the police showed that most of the letters were closed and some had been tampered with.

After the AEPD alerted the controller of the reports, the controller stated that they had identified the responsible employees and had started disciplinary proceedings. Further, the controller stated that the letters found had not been opened and therefore the leaked data was limited to the names and addresses on the envelopes. It therefore concluded that there had been no risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

The AEPD initiated an ex-officio investigation on the 28 December 2022 assessing the measures implemented by the controller to track shipments and training provided to employees.","The AEPD found that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR.

The AEPD highlighted that the controller could only show that its employees had signed a confidentiality agreement but that there were no other organizational measures in place which would have prevented this data breach. In addition, the AEPD criticized that apart from a one-hour training session at the beginning of the employment relationship, employees were not adequately informed on complying with the GDPR in their delivery functions.

As there was no system in place to see whether letters had actually reached the intended address, the AEPD found that the controller’s function as a postal service provider proved an aggravating factor in this case as it requires the controller to have such a system in place.

Therefore, the AEPD imposed a €120,000 fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and a fine of €80,000 for the infringement of Article 32 GDPR. Additionally, the AEPD ordered the controller to implement a tracking system as well as training for employees informing on GDPR compliant delivery of letters.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32"
"The controller is a company which operated a diagnostic laboratory during the Covid-19 pandemic. The managing director of this company was designated as the Data Protection Officer (DPO) for the controller. This designation was never notified to the Austrian DPA (Datenschutzbehörde – DSB).

The DSB initiated an ex-officio investigation, reviewed the register of the company and conducted an oral hearing. The controller argued that throughout the Covid-19 pandemic it was more efficient to combine the role of DPO and managing director. The company had delivered test results and in order to communicate with the public entity acting as the controller's client, it was easier to have one responsible contact person.

Further, the controller stated that the managing director showed appropriate awareness of his two roles and that there had been no risk of him neglecting his data protection duties.","The DSB held that the controller had violated Article 38(6) GDPR. The controller had taken no active steps to ensure that the managing director could avoid any conflict of interest in his role as DPO.

The DSB highlighted that the controller handled a large amount of health data under Article 9(1) GDPR. The DSB reiterated that a conflict of interest can occur if the DPO lacks the appropriate temporal resources to conduct their tasks, due to other duties. Based on the CJEU judgment C-453/21, the DSB stated that generally the DPO cannot be entrusted with determining the means and purposes of processing as this is exactly what the DPO is supposed to independently monitor.

The DSB rejected the controller’s argument that the managing director brought with him a sense of awareness regarding his data protection obligations. The DSB held that the controller was under an obligation to inform themselves on the requirements for DPO appointments. The fact that the controller did not do this amounted to negligence.

The DSB issued a €5,000 fine under Article 83(4) GDPR and under paragraph 64 of the Austrian Administrative Penal Act (Verwaltungsstrafgesetzes 1991 – VStG) ordered the controller to pay €500 for the procedural costs.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 38
"On 3 May 2023, utilising its investigative powers, the Greek DPA sent a questionnaire to 31 public authorities, including the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection (Controller), to assess the appointment and role of their DPO. The Controller failed to respond to the questionnaire on time, prompting the DPA to review its archives. It discovered no records of an appointed DPO and found that the Controller had not disclosed the DPO's contact details, as required under Article 37(1) GDPR and Article 37(7) GDPR.

The DPA summoned the Controller to an official hearing, where it admitted that no DPO had been appointed. It argued that this was due to organizational changes between ministries, resource constraints, and reliance on an external consultancy firm to assist with data protection matters. The DPA also determined that the Ministry’s website lacked any information regarding a designated DPO.","After its investigation, the DPA concluded that:

* The Controller violated Article 31 GDPR by failing to respond to the questionnaire in a timely manner.
* No DPO had been appointed since the Ministry's establishment Article 37 GDPR. A DPO was appointed only after the DPA demanded explanations, and this appointment covered the General Administration rather than the Ministry itself.
* The Ministry breached the principle of accountability Article 5 GDPR by:

1. Failing to appoint a DPO as required Article 37 GDPR.
2. Failing to provide clear and transparent information to data subjects about their rights Article 12 GDPR.
3. Not implementing measures to ensure GDPR-compliant data processing Article 25 GDPR.
4. Lacking a Register of Processing Activities Article 30 GDPR.
5. For failing to take or implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security against risks Article 32 GDPR

These failures resulted in a violation of the GDPR’s principle of lawfulness Article 5(1) GDPR.

The DPA considered several factors when determining the penalty, including the number of violations, their duration (dating back to the Ministry's establishment in 2021), the Controller’s failure to self-disclose these violations, and the fact that the Controller operates at a national level. As a result, the DPA imposed a total fine of €50,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 31, Article 32, Article 37, Article 58"

The investigation revealed that the controller´s employees did not respect data confidentiality of their clients´ data (here the data subjects) especially with regards of clients´ name, surname, e-mail addresses, customer code, and customer address. The data breach in question referred to different situations, among which:

-	the unlawful transmission of a data subject´s invoice to a third party;

-	not hiding data subjects´ email addresses and not selecting the BCC (“Blind carbon copy”) option in email correspondence concerning changes in a client’s account manager;

-	 the transmission via WhatsApp by an employee of a screenshot containing personal data present in the employee´s application interface.

Moreover, no technical or organizational measures existed in relation to ensure that the level of security is appropriate to the risk of processing, such as for instance, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

Moreover, the controller did not implement regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures already in place. This entailed that both the security of data processing, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continuous resilience of the processing systems and services could not be assured.

As a consequence of this failures, name, surname, home address, e-mail address and contact details of data subjects were disclosed unlawfully, in breach of Article 32(2) and 32 (3) GDPR.

"The DPA received a complaint against the controller Birou Gas S.L, following which the DPA requested information from the controller as part of the investigation process. Two initial requests were answered by the controller within the 10 working day deadline. However, the controller did not respond to two later requests for information, received on 1 and 2 February 2023.

The DPA initiated fine procedures on 10 April 2023 for the controller’s infringement of Article 58(1) GDPR in failing to respond to the requests for information. The controller subsequently requested suspension of the proposed fine because the person in charge of downloading the requests for information had been dismissed during this time, which was why the requests were misplaced by the controller. The controller also argued that the fine should be calculated according to the annual turnover of the company authorised by the controller to be the signatory to the contract agreed with the initial complainant.","The DPA found that the controller had violated Article 58(1) GDPR in failing to respond to the requests for information. The DPA did not accept the controller’s arguments regarding the dismissal of the person in charge of downloading the notifications, as receipts were available showing the controller had accepted the notifications on 2 February 2023. The fact the controller had previously responded to requests for information was also not relevant to the current fine procedure.

Additionally, the DPA did not accept the controller’s argument that the fine recipient should be the contract signatory, as the requests for information were sent to the controller.

The DPA took the following factors into account when issuing an administrative fine of €48,000 to the controller (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR):

- the controller was aware of the DPA’s actions to clarify the facts by receiving successive requests and requirements for information but intentionally or negligently omitted the information required; and

- the controller had been active since 2014, together with an annual turnover of approximately €50,000,000, so it should have established procedures for compliance with data protection regulation obligations (including responding to DPA requests via a reliable procedure that ensured requests were answered).

The DPA also applied a further aggravating factor by considering the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR). The controller’s lack of response hindered the DPA's work of supervising the guarantees of the personal data processing of new clients on behalf of the controller by third parties, and which the controller used to obtain new income.

"The controller is an insurance company. On 5 October 2022, the controller experienced high traffic on one of its servers, namely the one hosting the client managing tool. The controller noticed that an unauthorised third party stole the login details of an insurance broker and used them to access the platform.

The controller investigated the matter and came to the conclusion that the breach at hand affected 37 data subjects, i.e. only the data subjects that were being handled by the controller’s broker whose login details were stolen.

The controller did not have a log system tracking the logins and, therefore, was not able to identify the entity of the attack. However, it deemed that the data breach was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and, thus, did not notify the DPA pursuant to Article 33(1) GDPR.

However, on 11 November 2022, it was noticed that a database containing a sample of 24315 records concerning personal data of the controller’s former clients was being sold on a Telegram group.

At the same time, the controller discovered that, due to a bug on its IT system, the third party that performed the attack could not only access the data of that specific broker’s clients, but also the data of all the other clients of the controller. This data involved name, national number, telephone number, date and place of birth, civil status and IBAN.

At this point, the controller performed a new assessment of the risks involved by the data breach, deeming that it was indeed necessary to notify both the DPA and the data subjects involved.

Therefore, the DPA opened an investigation on this matter. Moreover, some data subjects filed a complaint with the DPA.","First, the DPA pointed out that, at the moment of the unauthorised access, the controller had not performed any data protection impact assessment concerning the processing activity at hand.

Secondly, the DPA noted that the controller had not implemented a 2-factor authentication system for the platform that was hacked.

Thirdly, the DPA recalled that, due to a technical failure in updating the system, the insurance brokers were able to access both their customers’ data and also the profiles of other data subjects.

Fourthly, the DPA pointed out that, due to these failures, the data breach at hand occurred. Therefore, it found a violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. It pointed out that the latter sets an obligation of result on the controller, whereas the result is to protect the data subject’s confidentiality.

On the other hand, according to the DPA, Article 32 GDPR sets an obligation of means, imposing to the controller to implement the appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, rather than guaranteeing a specific outcome. The DPA held that the measures adopted by the controller were inadequate and, therefore, found a violation of this article.

Moreover, the DPA held that the controller had not complied with Article 25(1) GDPR. More specifically, the controller, in designing the IT system, did not take into account the principle of data minimisation. Indeed, the controller kept in the same database data of former clients and data of the actual clients, without differentiating them.

Additionally, the DPA found that the controller should have conducted a Data Protection Impact Assessment and therefore had violated Article 35 GDPR. The reasons for the necessity of the DPIA were that the controller conducted large-scale processing of data.

On these grounds, the DPA issued a fine of €5,000,000 which was reduced to €4,000,000 due to the voluntary payment procedure under Spanish law. The fine was composed of €1,000,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, €1,000,000 for the violation of Article 32 GDPR, €2,000,000 for the violation of Article 25 GDPR and €1,000,000 for the violation of Article 35 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 25, Article 32, Article 33, Article 34, Article 35"

The documents contained, inter alia, the name, birthday, national identification number and filled-in medical questionnaires. The controller didn’t retrieve these documents from the wrong recipient.

The DPA informed the the controller about the possibility of a data breach in November 2022 and requested clarification on the matter. The controller explained in December 2022, that the incident could not be identified. The controller stated that the data subject’s medical questionnaire was not missing. Additionally, the controller informed the DPA that the data subject was notified about the incident under Article 34 GDPR. Also, the controller implemented remedial measures, i.e., a talk with the ward manager and a training for the employees. In February 2023 the controller provided the DPA upon request with its assessment that the breach only contained a low risk for the data subject .

Only in March 2024 the controller officially notified the DPA one the breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR. However he notice did not contain the information required under Article 34(2) and Article 33(3)(d) GDPR, i.e. measures to minimize its possible adverse effects of the breach.","The DPA found the controller violated Article 33(1) GDPR, Article 34(1) GDPR and (2) GDPR.

The DPA held, that given the extent and nature of the data breached - especially including the national identification number together with the name and health data - there is a substantial risk of harm to the data subject which the controller did not properly take into account. Moreover, the controller didn’t consider the fact that the documents remained with the unauthorised recipient. Thus, the breach posed a high risk to rights and freedoms of data subject, not low as indicated by the controller.

The DPA also emphasised that neither the DPA nor the data subject were notified sufficiently within due time under Article 33 and Article 34 GDPR. For the DPA, the controller didn’t demonstrate any reasons justifying delayed notification. The controller also behaved contradictory by first stating to the DPA that it could not identify the breach but at the same time notifying the data subject about the breach. However, the DPA found the content of the notification sent to the data subject to be inaccurate, since it mostly contained general statements. Hence, the data subject was unable to foresee negative consequences of the breach.

Results include information such as name, gender and age of present and former owners of a respective property. It also showed historical data on property sales and sales values, neighborhood information, property values, estimated property taxes and titles against the property. The data was compiled from multiple public registries.

The DPA submitted a request for comment to the controller. The controller stated, that all personal information such as name and gender would be temporarily removed from the website, while the DPA was investigating the matter. 

The controller explained that the purpose of his website is to create transparency on the Danish property market through an easy, simple and freely accessible overview of publicly available property information on a single platform. The controller stated that similar paid platforms already exist for realty professionals and argued that through these platforms realtors achieved an advantage over consumers who had no access to such information. Much of the information could also be found on other websites.

The controller maintained that the processing was within the scope of legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f)) after receiving the DPA’s guidance on access to public registers and a number of telephone conversations with the DPA. The controller believed that it's legitimate interest was not overridden by the interest or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects.","The DPA found that it's generally legal to process data from one or multiple public registers, which have already been publicised, for the purpose of  furthering transparency on the property market according to the Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

However, the DPA did not find it necessary to process personal data like individual's historical property holdings, name, gender and age for the controller’s purpose.  It held, that the intended purposes can be served with smaller impacts on data subjects’ right to privacy and protection of personal data.

Furthermore, the DPA argued, that even if the processing was to be considered necessary for the controller's purposes, the interest of increasing market transparency is overridden by fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, particularly because data subjects cannot reasonably expect such extensive interconnection and publication of their personal data to property information. As a consequence, the DPA held, that the controller's processing of such personal data could not be based lon Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

The disclosed data consisted of name surname, birthdate, address, e-mail address, phone number, national identification number (PESEL) and encrypted website-user passwords.

The controller notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about a data breach. The controller shared with the DPA a report describing the data breach details, including IP addresses, which were used to download the data. The DPA decided to initiate ex officio proceedings against the controller and the processor.

During the proceedings, the controller provided the DPA with all the documents covering their business relation with the processor, including its post-breach statements. In one of the documents, the processor stated that the breach was a result of their employee error. The controller claimed the processor to be liable for the breach, because the erroneous sever configuration caused the breach. Furthermore, the processor didn’t monitor the server activities as expected, failing to prevent the breach.

According to the processor, they were not aware that personal data were processed within the website database. The processing contract between the parties didn’t include the personal data processed on the website. Also, the controller didn’t inform the processor that the website was used to process the personal data related to the controller’s services. Consequently, the website was treated as a typical website of information purposes. Moreover, the processor emphasised they were assigned a task of moving the old website content to the new one. However, the controller didn’t instruct the processor to verify the security of the new website and its infrastructure, nor to monitor the server activities.

At a further phase of proceedings, the controller accounted for the measures implemented to mitigate the risk of future breaches of that kind.","The DPA found the controller violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 25(1) GDPR, Article 28(1) GDPR, Article 32(1) GDPR, Article 32(2) GDPR. The controller didn’t supervise the processor’s activity, assuming the professional status of the processor was a sufficient guarantee. The DPA found no evidence that the controller performed regular audits and inspections of the processor under Article 28(3)(h) GDPR. Also, the controller didn’t monitor if the processor adequately secured personal data during the process changing the servers. For the DPA, such an omission of the controller contributed to the breach. Thus, the controller didn’t implement appropriate security measures under Article 32 GDPR.

Furthermore, the controller violated another duty stemming from Article 32 GDPR. Although the controller decided to run a new website, they didn’t assess the risk posed by that process. In particular, the controller didn’t identify nor assess the risk stemming from moving the personal data from one server to another.

"In 2022, the French DPA (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés – CNIL) received complaints about the operators of a real-estate company (the controller) filed by employees of the company. The complaints related to monitoring procedures implemented by the company. The complaints lacked concrete evidence of violations of the GDPR so the CNIL started an investigation.

Investigation

The CNIL found that the company was consistently recording its employees by capturing both image and sound via two cameras which monitored workspace but also recreational spaces. The live footage could be viewed via a mobile phone app on the supervisor’s phone. The controller had put up a sign with a camera pictogram with the words “video-monitored space” on one of the doors. No other information had been supplied to employees.

The controller also implemented a software used when employees worked from home. This software counted working hours and discerned inactivity periods. This meant that the system would register inactivity anytime an employee had not hit the keyboard or used the mouse in more than 3 to 15 minutes. These inactivity periods were registered and if employees failed to compensate for the “time lost”, they were subject to pay deductions.

Additionally, the software recorded whether employees visited “productive” or “unproductive” websites, which were determined as such by the controller. Every 3 to 15 minutes, the software took screenshots of the employees’ screens.

The controller allowed shared access to the administrator account of the software meaning that it was impossible to track who had used the admin account. The admin account had extensive viewing rights and could therefore access large amounts of personal data.

Controller arguments

The controller brought forward that employees could also manually track their working time instead without any negative consequences. It explained that it had orally informed the employees of the functioning of the software. Further, it detailed that it only used the software for two and a half months and then uninstalled it.","Recordings

The CNIL held that the continuous nature and the capture of sound in the recordings was unjustified. It therefore found a violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

Lack of information

Beyond that, the CNIL found that the controller hadn’t adequately informed its employees of the video surveillance for example due to the sign containing no further information on the purpose or storage of the recordings. The CNIL here found violations of Articles 12 and 13 GDPR.

A violation of Article 12 GDPR also applied to the insufficient information provided orally to employees about the software and its monitoring functions.

“Inactivity” monitoring and screenshots

The CNIL found that registration of the alleged inactivity periods did not reflect actual working time. Therefore, the CNIL held that the controller could not rely on a legal basis for this data processing. Further, the CNIL found that the practice of regular screenshots proved particularly intrusive monitoring as sensitive personal information could be captured. Therefore, the CNIL found a violation of Article 6 GDPR.

Administrator account

The CNIL found that the shared access to the administrator account made it a prime target for ransomeware attacks and that the controller should have prevented this. Therefore, the CNIL found a violation of Article 32 GDPR.

Data Protection Impact Assessment

The continuous monitoring of employees demonstrated a high risk to their rights and freedoms obliging the controller to have carried out a DPIA before using the software. The CNIL therefore found a violation of Article 35 GDPR.

Fine

The CNIL took into account the relatively small size and the annual turnover of the company in setting the fine. The fine was set at €40,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 32, Article 35"

"The Region of Molise (the controller) used an information system to handle electronic health records and make them available to citizens. The controller relied on a number of processors and sub-processors, including IT services company Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.a., the developer of the system (the sub-processor).

Data processing agreements were in place between controllers, processors, and sub-processors. These agreements included provisions on security measures for processing personal data. In particular, the agreement between the controller and Società Molise Dati S.p.a. (the processor) provided for the limitation of account privileges on a need-to-know basis.

"A hospital (a controller) notified the Polish DPA (UODO) about a data breach. The data breach amounted to loss or theft of two CCTV memory cards. The CCTV covered the area of two rooms located within the neonatal ward. The breach affected 190 individuals, including controller’s employees, patients and their guardians. Additionally, shortly after the breach notification, an article describing the controller unlawful processing of the CCTV data was published.

The DPA decided to initiate ex officio proceedings against the controller.

During the proceedings, the controller explained they used wall clocks, equipped with a CCTV to protect health and safety of newborns. The controller claimed there was an increased number of infections on the neonatal ward. Because preventive measures implemented prior to the CCTV were insufficient, the controller decided to rely on the CCTV. The personal data collected by the CCTV were processed under Article 23a(1)(2) of law on medical service activities (ustawa o działalności leczniczej) and Article 22 note 1 of the labour code (kodeks pracy) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR too. The CCTV records were stored for no longer then 30 days. Moreover, the controller emphasised that QR codes with privacy notices and sticker informing about the CCTV were placed within their premises.

Regarding the data breach, the controller clarified that stolen memory cards served as the only storage of the recordings and the controller didn’t possess any backups. After the breach, the controller organised few meetings with their employees and notified data subject about the breach.","The DPA found the controller violated, Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 6(1) GDPR, Article 9(1) GDPR, Article 13(1) GDPR and Article 13(2) GDPR.

For the DPA there was no legal basis covering processing of the CCTV data by the controller. The controller didn’t demonstrate the CCTV was necessary for the purpose of limiting the number of infections or had positive influence on the course of treatment. Consequently, the conditions of article 23a of law on medical service activities were not fulfilled. Because that provision was an exclusive legal basis for hospitals’ CCTV processing of patients’ data, neither 222 of the labour law nor Article 6(1)(f) GDPR didn’t apply. Thus, the controller processed the CCTV data in unlawful manner and violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 6(1) GDPR, Article 9(1) GDPR.

Furthermore, the controller violated Article 13(1) GDPR and Article 13(2) GDPR. The DPA found the controller used a secret CCTV, which was hidden in the wall clocks. As a result, the data subjects were unaware of being under surveillance. Moreover, the privacy notices didn’t serve their purposes. Vague and undefined term of “crucial premises”, as used by the controller in their documents, was incomprehensive for data subjects, making them unable to find whether a room or an area they used was under the CCTV. Also, the sticker informing about the CCTV within the neonatal ward was place only on the main door. Such a practice was misleading data subjects as to the scope of the CCTV.

The above mentioned violations resulted in fine of PLN 687,534.75 (approximately €157 500).

Additionally, the controller violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, Article 5(2) GDPR, Article 25(1) GDPR, Article 32(1) GDPR, Article 32(2) GDPR.

The controller. didn’t secure the CCTV properly. The risk assessment performed by the controller didn’t include thorough description of threats associated with using the CCTV. In particular, a loss or theft of the data stored on memory cards was not taken into account. Therefore, the controller didn’t implement technical and organisational measures mitigating the risk posed by the CCTV. Because of that, the breach occurred.

In consequence, the controller received another fine of PLN 458,356.50 (approximately € 105,000).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 9, Article 13, Article 25, Article 32"
"The Region of Molise (the data controller) used an information system to handle electronic health records. In order to develop and operate the system, the controller relied on a number of processors and sub-processors, including Società Molise Dati S.p.a.

Data processing agreements were in place between controllers, processors, and sub-processors. These agreements provided for certain security measures. In particular, the agreement between the controller and the processor provided for the limitation of account privileges on a need-to-know basis.

"The controller (Capital Area Health Care Centre) runs multiple health centers. Following findings from procedures against another organisation, the DPA initiated an ex-officio investigation against the controller's processing of personal data in joined medical record systems maintained pursuant to national law (the Medical Records Act).

The DPA found, that the controller had entered into record sharing agreements with roughly a dozen parties (including other health service providers but also e.g. the Icelandic Football Association or Transport Authority) making available the records of ca. 450,000 individuals in one joint medical record system to which healthcare professionals working on behalf of the contracting parties had access. Such sharing agreements require a licensing both by the DPA and the responsible Ministry under the Medical Records Act.

The DPA's investigation revealed, that the controller had only undergone one such licensing process regarding the sharing only with one party. In this licensing process the DPA had considered the sharing necessary for the public interest consisting in better ensuring patient safety, pursuant to the Medical Records Act and Articles 6(1)(e) and 9(2)(h) GDPR. The Controller stated that the other agreements in substance were based  on that agreement, despite the fact that they did not undergo a formal licensing process. The controller acknowledged that there were shortcomings in the handling of those agreements.","The DPA did not question the permission regarding the one agreement where it was actually granted.

However, the DPA found that the required license was missing in all the other cases. The DPA held, that such a licensing process must be carried out each time a new party enters the joint health record system of the controller. Thus, the DPA held, that the controller could not demonstrate a legal basis in violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(2) GDPR that the other parties access to the joint medical record system was permitted as the conditions of Article 6(1) and (2) GDPR were not met. However, the DPA found that it is in the best interests of patients to leave the joint medical record system unchanged until the Minister's decision on the other permissions is made. Consequently, the DPA did not direct instruct the Controller for improvements according to Article 58(2) GDPR.

Nonetheless, the DPA decided to impose a fine on the controller. In view of Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, the DPA considered it mitigating that no damage occurred from the violations and following Article 83(2)(c) and (f) GDPR that the controller readily responded to the DPA's requests, applied for the required permissions and blocked access to those parties who are not considered competent to access them at all.

On the other hand, the DPA found the serious nature of the violation, the large number of affected persons and the fact that the processing in the joint record system had been ongoing for numerous years to aggravate the violation in accordance with Article 83(2)(a) GDPR. Additionally, the DPA found the violated obligation to be so clearly stipulated by law that it assumed intent on part of the controller when it failed to obtain the required authorisation thus aggravating the violation in accordance with Article 83(2)(b) GDPR. Additionally the DPA found, that the controller’s violations concern health information, which is considered sensitive personal information under Article 83(2)(g) GDPR.

Taking this into account, the DPA imposed an administrative fine of ISK 5,000,000 (approximately €34,360) on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9"
"In September 2018, a Maynooth University (data controller) staff member’s email address was compromised while they were in the process of handling a financial payment, and email “rules” set up to hide future received emails from the victim. This allowed the attacker to trick a University staff member into transferring a sum of money to a fraudulent account, believing it to be being paid into their pension pot. The email addresses of five other staff members were also compromised.

In October 2018, the victim of the financial fraud became aware of what had happened and reported it to the controller. The controller responded by resetting the user’s password and hiring an external cybersecurity firm to investigate the incident. The incident was not reported to the data protection authority (Data Protection Commission (DPC)) until November 2018, the following month. The controller's DPO reported the incident to the DPC within 72 hours of being notified by the controller. The controller had delayed alerting the DPO to conduct an external investigation instead.

The University identified that the personal data of 653 data subjects (of which it was possible to identify 463), consisting of their identity, personal public services number (PPSN), contact details, economic/financial data and location data was breached.

On the 7th November 2019, the DPC initiated an inquiry into the incident.","The DPC found that the controller failed to ensure the security of personal data, violating Article 5(1)(f) & 32(1) GDPR. The DPC found that although there were some security measures in place in respect of the email system, such as password protection, perimeter monitoring and encryption (both at rest and in transit), the DPC found these to be insufficient to discharge the controller’s obligation, given the nature and type of processing in question.

In particular, the DPC was critical of the lack of multi-factor authentication (as opposed to two-factor), inadequate anti-spam configuration, a lack of rules regarding password expiring and requiring to be changed, the lack of controls preventing the automatic forwarding of emails to external email addresses and the absence of a policy prohibiting the creation of email forwarding rules.

Secondly, in relation to Article 33 GDPR, the DPC held that the controller failed to meet their obligation to report the breach within 72 hours of having become aware of it. The DPC was critical of the controller’s delaying of notification them of the breach pending the outcome of the cybersecurity report, and held that notification should have occurred within 72 hours of having become aware of the breach, in October 2018.

The DPC issued a fine of €40,000, €25,000 for infringing Articles 5(1) & 32(1), and €15,000 for infringing Article 33. The DPC also made an order requiring the controller to implement a list of enhanced security measures.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 32, Article 33"

However, the data subject continued to receive newsletters on several occasions, specifically on October 26, October 29, and November 1, 2019.

On December 16, 2020, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Romanian data protection authority, which subsequently referred the matter to the Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH) in accordance with the GDPR’s cooperation mechanism.

First, the NAIH held that the controller violated Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, as it continued processing the data subject’s email address for marketing purposes without a valid legal basis. The data subject had withdrawn consent by attempting to unsubscribe multiple times, but the controller still sent newsletters between 30 July 2019 and 11 May 2021.

Second, the NAIH determined that the controller breached Article 12(3) GDPR by providing misleading information about the status of the data subject’s request. The controller confirmed the removal of the data subject’s email address on 17 October 2019, but in reality, due to a technical failure, the email remained in the newsletter system.

"In 2020 the Italian DPA fined telecom Wind Tre, the controller, €16,729,600 for the unlawful processing of personal data and unauthorised marketing communications to customers. The authority also ordered the controller to stop processing data acquired without consent.

Months later the DPA started a follow-up investigation of the company’s compliance with their orders. In particular, the DPA investigated the controller’s reliance on marketing subcontractors, its use of “cold lists” of contact data, and the collection and documentation of consumer's consent.

Additionally, the decision addressed several complaints against the controller over aggressive marketing practices.

The ex-officio investigation (procedure 178557)

The ex-officio investigation started in 2022 as a follow-up to the DPA’s 2020 decision against the controller. The DPA investigated the controller’s premises and requested information over certain features of its marketing systems and over the operations of its subcontractors.

The DPA found that 15 contracts were finalized with different numbers from those targeted by the controller’s campaign. These contracts were finalized by three different contractors (all of which qualified as processors under the GDPR). By hiring each processor, the controller violated several provisions of the GDPR. First, the controller was unable to prove that the data subjects were contacted with their consent. Second, two processors violated the controller’s established storage periods for customer data. Finally, one of the processors was established in Moldova and did not have an EU representative.

The use of cold lists bought from third-party websites raised compliance issues. The controller was unable to prove the consent to the use of numbers bought for third-party websites. Additionally, a single phone number was bought without the data subject’s consent.

Over time the data controller implemented several measures to bring its marketing activities into compliance, including:

* a new campaign management system to better track the operations of contractors;
* a quality control system to ensure compliance along the value chain;
* more rigorous selections and auditing of contractors;
* measures to protect its customers from CLI spoofing calls.

Crucially, the controller also stopped using “cold lists” for consumer marketing in December 2022.

The first complaint (procedure 133372)

The first complaint comes from a customer of the data controller, the data subject. When she activated the controller’s services, she denied all consents to marketing communications.

The data subject later consented to direct marketing from a third party, the processor. The controller had engaged this third party as a data processor. As a result, the data subject still received marketing communications for the controller’s services despite having denied her consent to the controller.

The second complaint (procedure 25395)

In 2021, a data subject received an unwanted SMS. He reached out to the controller and asked for his number to be blacklisted but kept receiving messages afterwards.

The controller claimed that it blacklisted the data subject and that the unwanted communications were caused by an unpredictable human error. It also claimed that its new Campaign Management system would prevent similar incidents in the future.

The third complaint (procedure 262138)

A misconfiguration in the controller’s Customer Relationship Management system resulted in a data breach on the controller’s website: a customer logged into another customer’s personal area after accidentally using the wrong client code.

The controller immediately fixed the vulnerability but did not notify the breach to the authority.","With regards to the ex-officio investigation and to the first and second complaints, the DPA held that the controller violated Articles 5(2) , 6(1), 7, 24, and 28 GDPR as well as Article 130 d. lgs. 196/2003 by failing to collect and document consent along the data processing chain. Additionally, in relation to the first complaint, the DPA held that the data subject’s refusal, communicated to the data controller when she activated the service, prevailed over the consent she later gave to the processor.

With regards to the third complaint, the authority held that the controller violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR by failing to implement appropriate security measures. Additionally, the controller violated Article 33 GDPR by failing to notify the authority.

"The DPA started an ex officio investigation, after a large journalist investigation was published, against a municipality, the controller. The investigation concerned the practice of the municipal cemetery of burying “fetuses” and “stillborn children”.

Each of the tombstones contains the same first name (which is a name traditionally assigned to stillborn children in Italian Catholic tradition), and different surnames, which correspond to the surname of the data subjects, who are the women who interrupted their pregnancy and the men who these women conceived the fetus with. The DPA found that, in the vast majority of cases, these data subjects did not know about the burial site and of the use of their surnames.

Additionally, the preliminary investigation of the DPA revealed that, in the online portal of the cemetery, it was possible to find the precise location of each tombstone by typing in the name and surname thereon written. The data available through this online research was name, surname, date of birth and death, as well as the specification of their status of “fetuses” or “stillborn child”.","Applicability of the GDPR and Violation of Article 6 GDPR and Article 9 GDPR

The DPA starts by considering that, in respect to the burial of fetuses, Article 7 of the Mortuary Police Regulation differentiates three different cases:

* “stillborn children”, who must be buried;
* “products of interrupted pregnancies”, aged 20-28 weeks, who must be buried either at their parents’ request, or the health facility’s request;
* “products of conception”, aged less than 20 weeks, who can be buried only at their parents’ request.

The DPA considered that the subject of the investigation concerned the personal data disclosures that related to the products of interrupted pregnancies and products of conception, for which the relatives did not request burial nor indicated to put their data on the gravestone.

The DPA found that the indication of the data subjects’ surnames, together with the data of birth and death of the products of interrupted pregnancies and products of conception allows the identification of the data subjects, as defined in Article 4(1) GDPR. The risk of identification in this case is high, considering that the data reported on burials and made available on the online consultation service, can be compared or cross-referenced with other sources, or with contextual information held by third parties in the community or family context.

Consequently, the data processed is personal data. The controller did not have a lawful legal basis for such processing. This unlawful processing is of particular gravity if considered that the processing concerned health data, as defined in Article 4(15) GDPR.

Thus the DPA found a violation of Article 6 GDPR and Article 9 GDPR.

Controllership

Once it has been determined that the GDPR is applicable and that unlawful processing happened, the DPA considered that, since the activities of cemetery services are among the tasks of public interest specifically attributed to the municipality by law, the latter plays the role of data controller in relation to the processing of personal data connected with the performance of those tasks.

Violation of Article 5(a), (b), (C), (d) and (2) GDPR

Consequently, the controller is subject to the principle of accountability, as per Article 5(2) GDPR, and of privacy by design and by default, as per Article 24 GDPR. Thus, the DPA considered that, when the municipality receives documentation with personal data from the health company, it is required to process the data in compliance with the aforementioned principles. Additionally, the controller is subject to the principles of lawfulness, correctness and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation and accuracy, as per Article 5(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) GDPR.

In relation to each of the mentioned principles, the DPA found the following:

The principle of accountability, as per Article 5(2) GDPR and of privacy by design and by default, as per Article 24 GDPR were breached as the municipality is not exempted from the need to carry out its own assessment on the data it receives from health authorities and facilities.

The principle of lawfulness, correctness and transparency, as per Article 5(1)(a) GDPR was breached due to the lack of legal basis for the processing.

The principle of purpose limitation, as per Article 5(1)(b) GDPR was breached as there is no specific and legitimate purpose to the data processing.

The principle of data minimisation, as per Article 5(1)(c) GDPR was breached as less-intrusive measures, as marking the burials with a simple code, are available.

The principle of accuracy, as per Article 5(1)(d) GDPR was breached as the data subjects’ surnames are not data related to the deceased.

Thus the DPA found a violation of Article 5(a), (b), (C), (d) and (2) GDPR.

Conclusion and Fine

Thus the DPA found a violation of Article 5 GDPR, Article 6 GDPR and Article 9 GDPR. The DPA deemed it appropriate to fine the controller €10,000.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, Article 9"
"After the Bank of Italy notified the DPA of a personal data breach, the DPA decided to start an ex officio investigation. The notification concerned requests for information advanced by the legal representative of a credit repair company to the databases of national banks. Credit repair consists of finding and fixing mistakes on your credit report to boost one's credit score. The legal representative was appointed as processor, while the credit rehabilitation company was the controller.

All these access requests concerned natural persons, the data subjects, who did not give any authorization for the search.

The DPA advanced a request for information to the controller, which remained unanswered. Thus, the DPA started an investigation, which revealed the following.

First, the controller deals primarily with the erasure of credit reports by banks. Data subjects reach out to the controller through their website. Subsequently, the controller calls the data subject about this service.

Second, when the controller calls the data subject, the controller gives information on data processing by means of a prerecorded voice to give the data subjects an overview on the services offered. Then, if the data subjects accepted, their data is collected. However, not all data present in the database was collected from the data subjects.

Third, the Privacy Policy is shared, first, with the data subjects via telephone, on the date of the the first phone contact and, for the second time, when they fill out a form on “mandate to act” in public and private central credit rating centers.

Fourth, the controller’s database revealed that:

* The controller's IT system contains data regarding 74,214 data subjects. This data includes: name, surname, place and data of birth, social security number and contact details.
* In each customer file, there are also the reports provided, by the companies and banking institutions, in response to requests for access made by the controller through the processor.
* In the IT system, personal data held by other credit rehabilitation companies could be consulted for insolvency recovery purposes.
* The aforementioned data, collected via paper forms, was given by every customer and was stored in the controller's office.

Finally, there were no systematic procedures for periodic deletion of old data. The controller retained the complete paper files and digital records, even if it no longer had any contractual relationship with those data subjects.","Violation of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 14(1) and (2) GDPR

The DPA found that, although the controller stored data of over 70,000 data subjects in a database., there was no indication of how, and by whom, the data has been collected, which is required in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

Moreover, the controller could not show, in the investigative phase, that the data subjects were informed of the data processing as required as per Article 14(1) and (2) GDPR.

Thus, the DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and Article 14(1) and (2) GDPR.

Violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR

In the Privacy Policy of the controller, no information was given as per the duration of the storage was given. More specifically, the controller never deleted the personal data that is no longer necessary. This for instance, would be the case for data subjects that did not use the controller’s services (amounting to several thousands).

Thus, the DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR.

Violation of Article 28 GDPR

The DPA considered that, in the context of this data processing, the processor was not authorized to process the personal data in question. More specifically, the DPA found that some processing is carried out by third parties without any contract or “other legal act under Union or Member State law”, as per Article 28(3) GDPR.

In the case at hand, the controller has availed itself of the cooperation of certain third parties, not respecting the conditions of Article 28 GDPR.

Thus, the DPA found a violation of Article 28 GDPR.

Violation of Article 37 and 38 GDPR

The controller appointed the legal representative of the company as DPO.

First, this designation was not communicated to the DPA, thus infringing Article 37(7) GDPR.

Second, as per Recital 97 GDPR, the DPO needs to be able to act in “complete independence”. The DPA found it quite clear that the role of DPO is completely incompatible with that of legal representative of the controller, since the same person who determines the means and purposes of processing cannot have the necessary independence to also exercise supervisory duties, on compliance with the rules and policies of the controller’s policies on the protection of personal data.

Thus, due to the appointment of an “inadequate” DPO and to the lack of communication of said appointment, the DPA found a violation of respectively Article 37(6) and 38 GDPR, as well as Article 37(7) GDPR.

Violation of Article 5(2) and 24 GDPR

The DPA found that the technical and organizational measures adopted by the controller to conform the process to the GDPR were not adequate to the nature, purpose, context and risks of the personal data processing in question. This is problematic in view of the principle of accountability ex Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24 GDPR.

Thus, the DPA found a violation of Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24 GDPR.

Violation of Article 157 of the Italian Privacy Code

The DPA further found a violation of Article 157 of the Italian Privacy Code, Codice Italiano Privacy, due to the lack of reply to the request for information advanced by the DPA to the controller.

The investigation revealed that the controller was victim of a cyberattack, and that the server on which the customer database was stored was illegally accessed.

The data illegally accessed included: name, surname, personal numeric code, home address, telephone, e-mail address and bank account number.

Moreover, the investigation revealed that the controller did not carry out the periodic testing, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing.","The DPA found that the lack of testing impeded the effective respect of data protection principles and the integration of the necessary safeguards during the processing.

"Various violations were identified:

1. Improper Disposal of Test Results In a medical practice offering COVID-19 tests, employees disposed of positive and negative antigen test results in a garbage bag next to a public glass recycling container. The documents contained sensitive health data under Article 9 GDPR and were accessible to unauthorized third parties. Despite acknowledging the increased burden on medical practices during the pandemic, the Hamburg DPA deemed this handling of health data unacceptable. A fine of €1,000 was imposed, which the practice accepted.

2. Refusal to Grant Data Deletion Requests A dedicated COVID-19 test center consistently ignored individuals’ requests for data deletion, violating Article 17 GDPR. Even after the Hamburg DPA intervened and initiated administrative proceedings, the test center refused to comply. Due to the systematic nature of the violation, the Hamburg DPA imposed a fine of €1,000, which the test center accepted.

3. Unsecured Online Access to Test Results Another test center provided test results via unencrypted email containing a direct URL to a PDF file. The URL structure included the tested person’s last name, making it easy to access other individuals' results by modifying the URL. This was a clear violation of Article 32(1) GDPR, as the test center failed to implement appropriate security measures. The Hamburg DPA imposed a fine of €2,700.

4. Unlawful Storage of ID Card Copies A fourth test center scanned and stored both the front and back of tested individuals' ID cards on an external hard drive. This exceeded the legal requirements for documentation under the German Coronavirus Testing Regulation. There was no legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR for storing complete ID card copies, and the practice posed a significant security risk. The test center did not cooperate with the Hamburg DPA to address the issue, leading to a fine of approximately €1,400.","Various COVID-19 test centers committed GDPR violations, including improper data disposal, failure to respect deletion rights, inadequate security measures, and unlawful data retention.

The Hamburg DPA imposed fines ranging from €1,000 to €2,700, depending on the severity of the violations.

While some entities accepted the fines, others displayed a lack of cooperation, which influenced the penalties imposed.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 17, Article 32"
"CP&A B.V., a company specializing in inspection and maintenance of public infrastructure, maintained an online absence registration system containing sensitive health data of 25 employees. The system, stored in a Google Drive file, was accessible without authentication or access controls from 12 March 2019, to 2 May 2019. The data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, BSN (Dutch citizen service number), dates of birth, and detailed health information such as reasons for absence, prognoses, and medical comments. The Dutch DPA found that CP&A violated the GDPR by processing special category data (health information) without adequate legal grounds and failing to implement appropriate security measures.","The Dutch DPA held that CP&A unlawfully processed health data, a special category of personal data, without a valid legal basis under Article 9 GDPR#1. The processing of such data is prohibited unless an exception applies, and CP&A failed to demonstrate that the processing was necessary for employee reintegration or other permissible purposes under Article 9 GDPR#2b and Dutch law.

Based on Article 9, paragraph 2, opening sentence and under b of the GDPR, the controller may process health data if this is necessary for the performance of obligations and the exercise of specific rights of the controller or the data subject in the field of employment law and social security and social protection law.

Under Article 9 GDPR#2b, health data can be processed if it is necessary for fulfilling obligations or exercising specific rights in employment, social security, or social protection law. Article 30 GDPR#1b further allows such processing if it is necessary for employee reintegration or guidance related to illness or disability. However, the Dutch DPA found that processing specific health details like illness names, complaints, or pain indications is not necessary for reintegration. Therefore, CP&A could not rely on  Article 30 GDPR#1b to justify its processing of such data. Since no other exceptions under  Article 30 GDPR applied, the Dutch DPA concluded that CP&A violated Article 9 GDPR#1 by unlawfully processing health data.

Furthermore, the Dutch DPA found that CP&A failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the health data. The absence of authentication or access controls exposed the data to unauthorized access, violating the requirement to maintain a risk-appropriate level of security.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 9, Article 32"
"International Card Services B.V. (ICS) failed to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before implementing a customer re-identification process (ID&V) in 2019. The process involved the large-scale processing of sensitive personal data, including names, birthdates, addresses, BSN (Dutch citizen service number), and ID document details, for approximately 1.5 million customers in the Netherlands.

ICS is a 100% subsidiary of ABN AMRO. Since 2015, ABN AMRO has been using an application from Mitek Systems B.V. (Mitek app) to determine the identity of its customers.","The Dutch DPA held that ICS violated Article 35(1) GDPR by failing to conduct a DPIA for its ID&V process. The processing involved sensitive personal data on a large scale, which posed a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.

Although ICS had implemented a risk assessment process (CRA), it did not meet the GDPR's requirements for a DPIA, as it primarily focused on fraud prevention and compliance with anti-money laundering laws rather than data protection risks. It lacked a systematic evaluation of data protection risks and failed to involve key stakeholders, such as the Data Protection Officer (DPO). In performing the CRA process, ICS did take into account the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects in the processing of personal data, but did not sufficiently recognise that this should have led to the execution of a DPIA.

According to the Dutch DPA Guidelines, processing that is likely to entail a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons is generally the case when two (of the nine) criteria listed in the Guidelines are met. In this case, two criteria listed in the Guidelines apply. These are: 1) sensitive data or data of a very personal nature; and 2) data processed on a large scale. For ID&V, the following data os a data subject are processed: the first and last name, date of birth, place of birth, address details, e-mail address, telephone number, gender, BSN, number of the ID document as well as the photo therein and a (liveness) photo. These personal data are, as follows from the Guidelines, to be regarded together as sensitive data and data of a very personal nature.

The Dutch DPA, upon closer examination of the facts, held the opinion that in this case there were no vulnerable data subjects whose personal data were processed. According to the Dutch DPA guidelines, vulnerable data subjects can be children, but also employees or a part of the population that requires special protection. The point is that there is an unbalanced relationship between data subjects and the controller. In this context, ICS has rightly argued that a credit card is not an essential financial product for the daily life of a data subject. A credit card does not have the function of a bank account and cannot be equated with one. This means that there is no unbalanced relationship between ICS and its customers and therefore ICS customers cannot be regarded as vulnerable data subjects as described in the Guidelines. Furthermore, it is not excluded that other credit card providers use a different method for identifying their customers. As a result, data subjects who are interested in a credit card have the choice to use the services of other providers.

In determining the seriousness of the violation, it was also found relevant that ICS processes personal data of a large number of data subjects, namely 1.5 million customers.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 35
"The municipality of Voorschoten implemented a waste collection system using chipped containers and tokens to regulate household waste disposal. The system collected personal data, including addresses, container/token numbers, and timestamps of waste disposal. The municipality stored this data for extended periods (up to five years for tokens and indefinitely for containers).

At the end of 2018, the above-ground shared containers were replaced by underground containers to serve residents of high-rise buildings. Undergroung containers can only be opened with a token, which contains a chip with a unique number. It can be determined for each underground container which tokens have access to the container. A container can be opened five times a day, after which access to the container is denied. After the container has been opened with a token, the municipality stores data in a municipal IT system. This concerns token number, address details, date and time of the dumping, location details and type of waste. This data was stored for five years.

In March 2019, all grey residual waste containers were replaced by new containers with a chip for low-rise buildings. Each household (residential address) now has only one container. The garbage truck is equipped with a reader that can read the number of the chip. If it is recognised, the container is emptied. The municipality then stores data in an IT system of the municipality's collection service. This concerns the chip number, the associated address, date and time of emptying, location data of emptying and type of waste. The container cannot then be emptied again for two weeks because the garbage truck will not accept the container. This data remained in the IT system as long as the container was in use and the data was deleted from the system when the container was replaced.","The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) has determined that the municipality unlawfully processed personal data related to waste disposal. The data in question included the chip number of waste containers or tokens, associated address details, date and time of container emptying or underground container access, location data, and type of waste. As the chip number links this data to an address, it directly or indirectly identifies residents.

The DPA assessed whether the municipality could rely on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR—necessity for the performance of a task in the public interest—as a legal basis. The purpose of the processing was clearly defined as reducing residual waste by regulating disposal. Moreover, the stated purpose could be achieved by the processing of personal data. After all, the address information plays a key role in limiting the amount of residual waste that a household can offer. The purpose of the processing also fits within the public task.

The short-term processing of personal data via the chip reader on garbage trucks was deemed necessary for verifying whether a container was provided by the municipality and had not been emptied recently. Similarly, for underground containers, checking whether a token granted access and whether disposal limits were exceeded was considered necessary. However, storing detailed records of which token or container was used, when, where, and for which type of waste was not deemed essential unless part of a diftar (differentiated waste collection) system, which the municipality of Voorschoten does not operate. Since long-term storage of waste disposal data was unnecessary for fulfilling a public interest task, the processing lacked a valid legal basis and was deemed unlawful.

On 24 May 2023, the waste management board informed the DPA that it would reduce the retention period for container disposal data to 14 days. Previously, data was retained for as long as a container remained in use (for overground containers) or up to five years (for underground containers).

Additionally, the DPA found that the municipality failed to adequately inform residents about the processing of their personal data, as required under Article 14 GDPR. While some information was provided, it did not clearly specify which personal data was processed, for what purpose, or on what legal basis. For example, letters informing residents about new underground containers with tokens did not disclose how personal data would be processed. The DPA concluded that the municipality had failed to meet GDPR transparency requirements.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 14"
"An employee of a home appliances online shop, the controller, notified a data breach to the DPA, as per Article 33 GDPR.

The DPA started an investigation, that revealed that an unauthorized person took advantage of a programming vulnerability and, consequently, accessed the website of the operator containing its customers’, the data subjects’, database.

Thus, the person concerned had access to the personal data of a large number of data subjects of the operator, namely: name, surname, telephone number, e-mail address, domicile, product details.

The investigation revealed that the controller did not carry out the regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the efficiency of technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing.","The DPA held that the controller did not implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures, either at the time of establishment of the means of processing, or during the processing itself, as required by Article 32 GDPR.

This is further aggravated by the lack of regular testing, evaluation and assessment that the investigation revealed.

The DPA found a breach of Article 32(1)(b), (d) and Article 32(2) GDPR deemed it appropriate to fine the controller RON 49,766 (€10,000).

"The DPA received numerous complaints against the Greek National Bank (the controller) concerning the violation of the right of access of data subjects under Article 15 GDPR, due to non-satisfaction or long delays. Following this, the DPA investigated - ex officio - the procedures followed by the controller for such access requests.

The DPA found that in one instance the controller had used the data subject's personal data in the context of litigation between the two parties which the data subject itself had previously requested and had not been granted even after the expiration of the submission-deadline, resulting in an unfavorable evidentiary position for the data subject.

In other cases, the DPA found that the controller only responded after between two to seven months, sometimes only partially or after intervention of the DPA.

The controller stated that in recent years there has been an increase in electronic fraud cases, which had lead to a rapid increase in corresponding requests. According to the controller, every possible effort was made to serve its customers, seeking to exhaust every margin for their recovery, however, the proper and complete investigation of these incidents often proves to be time-consuming, as it requires a thorough search of the controller's files and systems, cooperation of all involved areas, evaluation of the actual incidents and communication with the other parties involved (e.g. beneficiary's bank, etc.). The controller also invoked its teleworking arrangements, due to which their access to the requested information was not possible in some cases.","The DPA found that the procedures followed by the controller for handling access requests were ineffective.

The DPA held, that the fact that despite the existence of known complaints and issues with meeting the GDPR deadlines established by Article 12(2) GDPR the controller was mobilized to record its relevant procedures only after the the DPA initiated investigations.

This, the DPA found, demonstrated that the controller had complied with access requests in an impermissible manner given the volume and nature of the personal data it processes, the multiple access requests it must have expected to receive and the possible risks from the delay in satisfying the right of access (e.g. inability of data subjects to prove fraudulent transactions).

The DPA emphasised that the fact that the controller began to receive an unusually large number of access requests is a factor that should have been taken into account when designing and updating its relevant procedures in compliance with Article 25(1) GDPR from the time this increase was detected, ensuring that it responded to this new condition, taking into account the employment status of its employees.

Specifically, the controller should have already assessed its weaknesses, initially when the increase in access requests was observed as a consequence of the outbreak of electronic fraud, subsequently when the complaints of its customers intensified and in any case when the DPA proceeded to an ex officio audit of its procedures. The DPA found that the controller's Policies are theoretical texts that are not applied in practice, despite its assurances.

Given this, the DPA found a violation of Article 12(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 25(1) GDPR. Regarding the amount of the fine, the DPA considered under Article 83 GDPR

* the large number of affected subjects, i.e. potentially the entire customer base of the controller, as well as third-party natural persons and 
* the long duration of the infringement, since it concerns the period since the entry into force of the GDPR. 
* that the infringement concerns the main activities of the controller and that the controller has been previously sanctioned for infringements of the right of access. 
* that the controller ignored the correct and timely satisfaction of access rights for a long period of time and only  formulate relevant policies after the audit by the DPA.

Thus, the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €200,000 for the established violation of Articles 12(2) and 25(1) GDPR.

With regard to the case, where the controller used requested data against the data subject in court before responding to the access request, the DPA considered it necessary to impose an effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine, pursuant to Article 83 GDPR considering the heightened gravity of the violation. Thus the DPA imposed  an administrative fine of €20,000 for the established violation of the right of access in this one instance under Article 15(1) and (3) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 12, Article 15, Article 25"
"A company (the controller) with 337 employees processed biometric data (fingerprints) of its employees to track their working hours using fingerprint scanners. On 5 July 2018, the Dutch DPA received a notification that employees at the controller were required to have their fingerprints scanned. This processing took place from 25 May 2018 to 16 April 2019.

The  DPA launched an investigation and concluded that employees were clocking in and out using their fingerprints for the purpose of time registration.

Five scanning stations are present and active at the company, three of which have a fingerprint scanner. One of these three is used for testing and recording fingerprints, the other two for clocking in and out. All these scanning stations exchange data with a software program, which, in addition to checking presence and absence, provides insight into working hours, absenteeism and overtime.

After the fingerprint has been recorded, the templates of those fingerprints are stored as a text file in a digital folder. These templates of fingerprints that have been recorded since the beginning of 2017.","Under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying individuals is prohibited, unless an exception applies.

[[Article 9 GDPR#2a|Article 9(2)(a) GDPR]]: Explicit consent is required for processing biometric data. The AP found that the company had not obtained valid consent, as employees were not adequately informed, and consent was not freely given due to the imbalance of power between employer and employee.
[[Article 9 GDPR#2g|Article 9(2)(g) GDPR]]: Processing biometric data is allowed if it is necessary for authentication or security purposes. The AP concluded that the company's use of fingerprints for time registration did not meet this exception, as less intrusive methods (e.g., ID cards) were available. The company argued that the processing was necessary to prevent time fraud, but the AP determined that this did not meet the threshold for being considered a ""necessary"" measure under the GDPR.

The DPA applied its 2019 Fine Policy Guidelines, which categorize violations of Article 9 GDPR as Category IV (the most severe category), with a base fine of €725,000. Considering the nature, severity, and duration of the violation (over 10 months), as well as the number of affected individuals (337 employees), the violation was deemed serious.

"According to the KNLTB estimates, there are 1,782 tennis clubs in the Netherlands, of which 1,657 (or 97%) are affiliated with the KNLTB. According to the KNLTB website, almost 570,000 tennis players are affiliated with the KNLTB (via these tennis clubs), making the KNLTB the second largest sports association in the Netherlands.

From March 2018 to October 2018, the KNLTB initiated actions with two sponsors in which personal data such as name, address and place of residence and telephone numbers of KNLTB members were used. One sponsor sent two discount flyers by post to a selection of KNLTB members and the other sponsor called a selection of KNLTB members in a telemarketing campaign to sell products.

On 22 October 2018, the Dutch DPA launched an investigation into the provision by the KNLTB of personal data of its members to sponsors with the aim of approaching the members with ‘tennis-related and other offers’ after receiving tips and complaints from a number of members. On 7 May 2019, the DPA adopted its investigation report.

For one specific marketing campaing, the information of 314,846 members was sent to one of the sponsors.","The Dutch DPA found that the KNLTB had violated the GDPR by unlawfully sharing members' personal data with sponsors for commercial purposes. Additionally, the KNLTB provided email addresses to a sponsor when they were unnecessary for a telemarketing campaign, thereby increasing the risk of spam and phishing.

Since 2007, the KNLTB has informed its members that their personal data would be shared with sponsors to generate additional income. As a result, the DPA concluded that for members who joined before 2007, their data was originally collected solely for the purpose of executing the membership agreement. The subsequent use of their personal data for commercial purposes was deemed incompatible further processing under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR, as the original purpose (membership administration) did not include sharing data with sponsors for marketing. The KNLTB’s statutes from 2005 did not specify the categories of third parties to whom personal data could be provided or the purposes for which these third parties would use the data. The DPA determined that these objectives were not sufficiently well-defined or explicitly described, as KNLTB members could not reasonably infer that their personal data would be used to generate income through direct marketing by sponsors. Therefore, the KNLTB should not have collected personal data for this purpose.

Further processing of personal data is lawful only if:

- The data subject has given valid consent; - A provision of Union or Member State law justifies the processing under Article 23(1) GDPR; or - The new purpose is compatible with the original purpose of collection.

As membership in the KNLTB is mandatory for individuals who wish to join an affiliated tennis club, members could reasonably expect that their personal data would be processed exclusively for membership-related purposes. The DPA considered the non-profit status of the KNLTB and found that members would not have expected their data to be shared with sponsors for commercial reasons.

For members who joined after 2007, the DPA found that the KNLTB lacked a valid legal basis for processing under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) GDPR, as members were neither adequately informed nor given the opportunity to consent to the data sharing.

The DPA rejected the KNLTB’s argument that the processing was based on legitimate interest, concluding that the commercial interest in generating revenue did not outweigh members' fundamental rights to data protection.

Furthermore, informing members after their personal data had already been collected was not sufficient to justify the processing. The investigation revealed that KNLTB members did not expect the telemarketing campaign, which led to numerous complaints and public controversy. The campaign was ultimately terminated early due to the backlash.

The DPA determined that the KNLTB’s actions constituted a serious GDPR violation, particularly because personal data was shared with third parties for commercial gain.

An investigation revealed that 197 employees, including 85 who were unauthorised, had accessed the patient's records. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, AP) found that the hospital had failed to implement two-factor authentication and regularly review log files, as required by Article 32(1) GDPR, since January 2018.

"A financial institution (the controller) processed personal data regarding loans applied for by their clients or potential clients (data subjects). To assess data subjects’ creditworthiness, the controller relied on profiling. For this purpose, the controller processed inter alia name, surname, national identification number (PESEL), source of income and information on financial obligations. The profiling resulted in credit scoring, used by the controller to make a decision about a loan application.

The Polish DPA (UODO carried out an ex officio inspection of controller’s profiling. The inspection purpose was to verify the processing compliance with the GDPR.

The inspection raised doubts over controller’s DPO position. A person appointed as the DPO was also employed as a consultant within a department responsible for data security. That department was also managing controller’s personal data processing. Within controller’s structure, the DPO was under direct authority of a director of the data security department.

Moreover, the DPA found no data protection impact assessment to be carried out for controller’s profiling. Also, controller’s record of processing activates was lacking profiling.

Thus, the DPA initiated proceedings against the controller.","The DPA found violation of Article 38(3) GDPR, Article 30(1) GDPR, Article 35(1) GDPR and Article 35(7) GDPR.

The controller didn’t guarantee DPO’s independence. Although, controller’s policies provided for the DPO should directly report to their highest management body (the board), the factual structure was different. The DPO was simultaneously employed within the data security department. Consequently, they were subordinate to the director of that department, not the board.

Furthermore, the controller didn’t properly maintain the record of processing activities. Because the profiling served the credit scoring, it was necessary to include its accurate description in the record. Otherwise, the record was ineffective, since it didn’t contain crucial processing of the controller.

Additionally, the controller didn’t perform data protection impact assessment under Article 35 GDPR covering the profiling at stake. The DPA found that due to the risk posed by the profiling and its functionality, it was one of controller’s duties to perform data protection impact assessment.

For the violations of Article 38(3) GDPR, the controller was fined PLN 261,918 (approximately €60,000).

The employee shared some of the thus accessed information with others.

This was not noticed for a very long period of time (2015-2022) and resulted in 6,167 individuals being affected by the incident. The information to which unauthorized access was obtained concerned personal data of special categories (health and disability). The notification of the incident was late because an investigation was required to identify the source of the data leak and confirm the breach.","The DPA concluded from the security gap that the following measures were not implemented at the level of addressing internal threats in violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR in conjunction with Article 32 GDPR:

* Adequate system monitoring
* Implementation of security policies so that users cannot act outside their intended permissions 
* Additional system monitoring at the level of administrator activity 
* Existence of technical measures which could prevent organizational errors of this type. 

The DPA found the gravity of the violations to be overall minor. Thus, the DPA considered a fine of €3,000 to be appropriate.

Specifically, pursuant to Article 83(2) GDPR and Article 83(5)(b) GDPR the DPA took into account as aggravating factors:

* That the employee had the possibility of unauthorized access to the system with elevated system administrator rights for a long period of time, during which this possibility was not realized. 
* That particularly important categories of personal data were affected, 
* That special categories of personal data were affected, such as health data-disability percentage.

Privacy compliance and quality controls

The authority inquired about the measures taken by the data controller to ensure privacy compliance both in its own marketing activities, and in the marketing activities of its subcontractors (acting as data processors or sub-processors).

The controller implemented some technical and organizational measures to implement data protection principles, including quality check calls and checks for the recipient’s consent to marketing. Starting March 2024, the controller implemented a more robust privacy compliance program: for instance, the controller provided its employees with privacy training, and adopted more robust privacy standards for its contractors.

The authority found these measures to be insufficient. The authority held that the data controller failed to vigilate over the privacy practices of its subcontractors. Additionally, the controller failed to choose subcontractors with robust privacy practices. In this regard, the authority pointed out that it still received complaints about aggressive marketing on behalf of the controller after March 2024.

The authority also observed that controllers must adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the implementation of data protection principles from the very beginning of the data processing (data protection by default).

Consent and the Do Not Call registry

The data controller pointed out that some of the recipients (the data subjects) consented to the processing of their data for marketing purposes after their inclusion in the Do Not Call Registry. These consents were collected via four third-party websites where users provided their personal data in order to receive commercial offers. In the controller’s view, the data subjects’ consents authorized its marketing calls.

The authority found issues with the consents. Three websites (nuoveofferte.com, offertenergetiche.it, and ricercaofferte.it) prompted users to consent to marketing for a very broad range of products and services. After consent collection, personal data were shared with an undefined number of companies for marketing purposes, each acting as the data controller. Additionally, users could not choose the form of the marketing communications they would receive. A fourth website (Offerte-gas-luce.it) lacked a privacy notice altogether.

For these reasons, the authority held that the websites did not collect granular and free consent. In this regard, the authority referred to its own guidance on telemarketing.

The data controller also defended its practices by pointing out that energy contracts were not concluded over the phone: the phone calls only served to initiate contact and to direct prospective customers to the controller's website. For this reason, the controller argued that the calls were not a form of telemarketing and did not fall under the Italian rules on the Do Not Call registry.

The authority rejected the controller’s argument. In the authority’s view, calls that merely initiate contract with the customer, are nonetheless telemarketing. In this regard, the authority referred to the Code of Conduct on telemarketing and teleselling.

Job candidates and privacy notices

The authority inquired on the provision of information to the controller’s job applicants.

Individuals could apply for a job with the controller by providing personal data on its website. Initially, the controller would provide applicants with a privacy notice before the job interview. The data controller provided no notice at a collection and provided no information at all to applicants who did not show up for the job interview.

The data controller eventually improved its practices. Starting July 2024, the data controller started providing applicants with a notice at collection.

The authority held that the data controller violated its transparency obligations until July 2024. Additionally, the authority held that the controller did not correctly identify the legal bases for processing applicant’s data in the earlier version of its privacy notice.","Overall, the authority held that the controller violated Articles 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 24, 25, 28, 29, and 32 GDPR as well as Articles 111-bis and 130 d. lgs. 196/2003.

The authority fined the controller €300,000. The authority also ordered the controller to implement better data protection measures through the marketing value chain and to document its follow-up. Finally, the authority ordered the controller to inform 68 complainants of the outcome of the procedure.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 7, Article 9, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25, Article 28, Article 29, Article 32"
"The DPA conducted an ex officio investigation in relation to the telemarketing activities of real estate investor One United Properties SA (the data controller).

The investigation revealed several unsolicited commercial messages were sent to different data subjects over a prolonged time period. The controller was not able to prove the consent of the data subjects to the processing of their data for marketing purposes. Additionally, some data subjects requested multiple time to access their data and to have a confirmation of whether their data was being processed or deleted. The controller did not respond to such access request by the data subject.","The DPA found that, by not being able to prove the consent of data subjects to the processing, the controller violated Article 6 GDPR.

In relation to the access request, the lack of reply within one month of reception of the request, hindered the exercise of rights of the data subject. Thus, the controller violated Article 12(3), 15 and 17 GDPR.

Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Articles 6, 12(3), 15 and 17 GDPR. For these reasons, the DPA imposed a fine of RON 9,994 (€2,000).

Additionally, the DPA ordered the controller to bring its direct marketing into compliance with the GDPR:

1.	By no longer processing personal data without the consent of the data subjects and without the existence of any other legal basis for processing the data subjects' data, including for marketing purposes;

2.	By training their staff on how to properly handle data subject access requests.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 15, Article 17"

In a preliminary decision, the DPA found that the controller did not comply with a number of key data protection principles, including accountability, transparency, lawfulness, data minimisation, storage limitation, and data security.

The DPA issued instructions to the controller in order to bring its data processing into compliance with the GDPR. The DPA later evaluated the controller’s compliance with its orders.","In its final decision, the DPA fined the controller €48,000 for the breaches of the Regulation that took place before it complied with the DPA’s instructions.

"A medical doctor (the data controller) sent an email to his patients during the municipal elections of June 8-9, 2024. In this email, the controller informed patients about his candidacy as town councillor and asked for their support and votes.

The DPA became aware of the controller's actions through a report and news articles and questioned the controller. He stated that he had collected the email addresses directly from patients who had contacted him for medical information or assistance. He also claimed the emails were sent based on explicit consent obtained through an information notice that included ""Promotional Activities, Information via Telematic Means, and Newsletter"" among the processing purposes.

The controller also argued that many email addresses were pseudonyms or fantasy names and, therefore, could not be referred to specific individuals. The controller confirmed that approximately 500 patients received the email.","First, the DPA established that patients' email addresseses qualify as personal data and, specifically, health data, since they are contact details of directly or indirectly identifiable patients. The DPA referred to case law, including a recent Court of Justice of the European Union decision, confirming that information that can reveal a connection between a person and healthcare services constitutes health data under the GDPR.

Second, the DPA determined that the controller lacked a valid legal basis for processing these data for electoral purposes. The consent obtained from patients was not valid for electoral propaganda because this specific purpose was not explicitly mentioned in the information notice provided to patients. The DPA also rejected the controller's claim that electoral messages could be considered equivalent to ""newsletters"" or ""promotional activities"" mentioned in the consent form and noted that, according to the Medical Code of Ethics, medical advertising can only concern ""professional titles and specializations, professional activities, service characteristics offered, and fees for services.""

Third, the DPA found that by including all 500 recipients in the ""copy"" (CC) field rather than the ""blind copy"" (BCC) field, the controller had unnecessarily exposed the identity of all his patients to each other, revealing their status as patients without justification and violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality.

Fourth, the DPA dismissed the controller's defense that he lacked proper training on data protection matters, emphasizing that as a data controller, he was obliged to know and observe applicable data protection rules with ordinary diligence. The DPA also pointed out that core data protection principles have been in force since 1998 and that the DPA itself has issued numerous decisions on the topic of electoral propaganda since 2001.

Incidentally, the DPA highlighted that the controller had also potentially violated the Code of Medical Ethics, which prohibits abuse of professional status and conflicts of interest, by leveraging the trust relationship established with his patients for personal electoral advantage.

Overall, the DPA determined that the controller had violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, and integrity and confidentiality 5(1)(a), (b), and (f) GDPR) and processed special category data without an appropriate legal basis (in violation of Article 9 GDPR). For these reasons, the DPA imposed a €10,000 fine.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 9"
"The DPA carried out an ex officio investigation on a news outlet (the controller). The investigation concerned the security of the processing of personal data.

The investigation highlighted several issues with the controller’s operations:

* the controller did not carry out a risk analysis for the processing personal data;
* the controller’s data protection and IT security policies were not reviewed and updated;
* the controller did not encrypt the drives on its devices, in violation of its own IT security policy;
* the controller had no internal policies to ensure that personal data were published in accordance with Polish law.

At the time of the investigation, the controller was in liquidation and did not submit a defense.","The DPA held that the controller failed to ensure the secure processing of personal data, in violations of Articles 24(1) and 32(1) and (2) GDPR. For this reason, the DPA fined the controller PLN 56,824 (€13,500).

On Article 85 GDPR and national derogations

The controller’s journalistic activity was covered by GDPR derogations under Polish law. However, the DPA clarified that under Article 85 GDPR, only specific GDPR provisions can be derogated under national law. In particular, the DPA pointed out that national law cannot provide for derogations to Articles 24 and 32. For this reason, controllers that engage in journalistic activities must still process personal data securely.

On security and risk assessments

The DPA explained in some detail how controllers should determine the appropriate security measures for processing a personal data. The DPA described a two-step process: first, controllers must assess the level of risk associated with the processing of personal data, taking into account the criteria from Article 32(1) GDPR: after the risk assessment, controllers must adopt personal measures adequate to the risk level. Additionally, the controller's risk assessment needs to be documented, periodically reviewed, and updated if necessary. With regards to the risk assessment and the choice of security measures, the DPA referred to national case law.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 24, Article 32"
"As part of the implementation of the coordinated activity of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the DPA assessed whether DPOs have an adequate role  as well as adequate resources necessary to perform their tasks implementing a survey among DPOs in Croatia.

Following that questionnaire, the DPA requested a statement and documentation from the controller (a company) on the role of the DPO within the controllers organisational framework.

The appointed DPO is also the controller's procurator. The contact details of the DPO were not visible, therefore, with a second request for comment, the DPA requested a comment on the reasons for not publishing the contact details of the DPO on the controller's website.

Thus, the DPA also requested a statement on how the powers of the procurator do not affect the determination of the purpose and means of processing in the organization of the controller.

The controller submitted that the powers of the procurator are completely separate from the tasks of the DPO. Regarding the contact details on the controller's official website, the controller stated that they were missing due to an oversight by the developer of the page.","The DPA concluded from Article 37(5), (6), (7) GDPR in conjunction with Article 38 GDPR and Article 39(1) GDPR that a conflict of interest will not generally arise if the DPO, in addition to his tasks, also performs other tasks and duties which are exclusively advisory or supervisory in nature, or if this other role performed by the DPO cannot influence the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

The DPA stated that Article 38(6) GDPR establishes a safeguard mechanism that prevents the DPO from finding himself in a conflict of interest while performing his tasks prescribed by the GDPR. The DPA interpreted this as meaning that the DPO cannot be an employee of the controller who determines the reason (purpose) and the manner (means) of the processing of personal data, or who can have a direct influence on the determination.

The DPA found that, the role of the procurator in a company is one of the most important roles within a company. In accordance with national law a procurator may conclude all contracts and undertake all legal actions in the name and on behalf of the company and represent it in proceedings before administrative and other state bodies, institutions with public law powers, and state and elected courts. Thus, the DPA considered that when the procurator also performs the tasks of the DPO, he can inevitably influence the determination of the purpose and means of the processing of personal data within the controller and is therefore in a conflict of interest.

The DPA emphasized that representing the company in the broadest possible form for the DPO means a conflict of interest in performing his/her tasks, since taking care of risks and informing about possible violations GDPR is incompatible with making business decisions that may be profitable for the controller, and negatively affects the right to the protection of personal data as one of the fundamental constitutional rights of the Republic of Croatia.

Therefore the DPA determined that the role of the procurator is incompatible with the role of the DPO due to a conflict of interest and its appointment violated Article 38(6) GDPR.

Furthermore the DPA established that the controller did not publish the contact details of the DPO on the company's official website, thus violating the provisions of Article 37(7) GDPR.

Pursuant to Article 83(2) GDPR the DPA considered the following when deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine, :

* The unlimited number of data subjects concerned;
* the existence of negligent conduct on the part of the controller;
* the controller subsequently published the contact details of the DPO, which was taken into account as a mitigating circumstance;
* the controller did not respond adequately to the requests of the DPA and the aforementioned circumstance was taken into account as an aggravating circumstance; and
* that the DPA became aware of the GDPR infringement in the framework of the coordinated activity and not by reporting of the controller.

Due to the violation of Article 37(7) GDPR and Article 38(6) GDPR, the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €12,000 on the controller.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 37, Article 38"
"In June 2022, DPP Law Ltd (controller) suffered a cyber-attack.

Threat actors were able to obtain administrator status on a legacy case management system and extract 32GB worth of data. The data was comprised of Court documents, PDFs, photos and videos relating to their clients, some of which related to sexual offences and child sexual abuse material. In July 2022, the National Crime Agency (NCA) informed the controller that some of their data was published on the dark web.

43 days after the incident, the controller reported the breach to the ICO (UK DPA).","The DPA found that the controller infringed the integrity and confidentiality principle in Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR & the obligation to implement appropriate technical and security measures under Article 32(1) UK GDPR.

The DPA’s investigation identified critical failings in the controller’s network security which allowed the cyber-attack. The account through which the threat actors gained access, sqluser, was over-privileged and allowed full access to the controller’s network. This account was not needed by the controller on a day-to-day basis and should have been identified as a risk in an audit. The legacy case management system in use was also shown to have been outdated as support for the system had also ended in 2019.

The DPA also found that the controller infringed the obligation to report a personal data breach to the DPA withing 72 hours under Article 33(1) GDPR.

The DPA was critical of the fact that the controller’s notification came 43 days after the breach and after the communication from the NCA. The DPA accepted that the controller focused their efforts on getting their systems working again, but noted that the risks posed to data subjects were not properly assessed and addressed at the time of the breach.

In assessing the amount of the fine to impose, the DPA was influenced by the sensitivity of the personal data in question, the extent of the controller’s negligence, and the need for a dissuasive penalty.

"In an investigation of their own volition, the Data Protection Commission (Irish DPA) launched an inquiry into the lawfulness of TikTok’s (controller) transfers of personal data of EEA users to China. The inquiry also looked at TikTok’s compliance with their transparency requirements.

Throughout the investigation, TikTok maintained that they did not store EEA user data on their Chinese servers. In April 2025, TikTok corrected this and informed the DPC that due to an error, some EEA user data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers, but this was no longer the case.

During the investigation, TikTok claimed that transfers via remote access do not require a transfer mechanism as mandated under Article 46(1) GDPR. In an assessment of Chinese laws provided by TikTok to the DPC during the investigation, TikTok had themselves identified that the Chinese legal framework would preclude a finding of “essential equivalence”, as required, in addition to the adoption of appropriate safeguards and supplementary measures. In this assessment, TikTok made reference to the Chinese Anti-Terrorism Law, the Counter-Espionage Law, the Cybersecurity Law and the National Intelligence Law.

The investigation also revealed that TikTok’s October 2021 EEA privacy policy did not name the third countries, such as China, where personal data was transferred. Furthermore, the policy did not specify that personal data held by TikTok in Singapore and the United States could be accessed remotely by personnel in China.","The DPC found that TikTok had infringed Article 46(1) GDPR in respect of the transfers of the personal data of EEA users via remote access to China. The DPC held that TikTok had failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the supplementary measures and standard contractual clauses (SCCs) relied upon were effective to ensure that the personal data of EEA users were afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that in the EU.

The DPC also found that TikTok had infringed Article 13(1)(f) GDPR, the obligation on controllers to inform data subjects of their intention to transfer their personal data to a third country at the point of data collection in respect of their October 2021 privacy policy. The DPC held that TikTok failed to both name the third country in question (China), and to specify the manner in which this processing occurred (i.e. by remote access).

"Energy provider Acea Energia S.p.a. (the controller) relied on a number of processors and sub-processors for marketing purposes. In particular, the controller relied on a one-person company called Stefanelli Federica (the processor), which in turn relied on sub-contractor MG Company (the sub-processor).

The controller concluded a DPA with the processor. However, the processor did not conclude a DPA with the sub-processor. Additionally, the sub-processor was not registered as a marketing operator, in violation of Italian national law.

The sub-processor engaged in a long list of illegal practices such as contacting prospects without their consent, lying to prospects about (non-existing) billing issues, and eluding telemarketing laws under the pretence that it engaged in door-to-door marketing rather than telemarketing. Over one and a half years, the sub-processor concluded about 30.000 contracts and earned the processor about €2,000,000 in provisions.

In 2024 a popular TV show aired a report on the sub-contractor’s marketing practices. The authors of the show also reported their findings to the Italian DPA. In turn, the DPA opened a joint investigation with the financial police.","The controller claimed that it was unaware of the sub-controller's involvement in its telemarketing activities and blamed the processor for engaging with the sub-processor without the controller’s knowledge.

The DPA rejected the argument. The controller was responsible for appointing a reliable processor, and for watching over the compliance of the data processing chain.

The controller clearly failed to do so in the case at hand. The appointed processor was a one-person business with no registered employees and could not possibly have concluded tens of thousands of contracts on behalf of the controller. So, the DPA held that the controller knew or should have known that the marketing involved unauthorized personnel.

For this reason, the DPA held the controller responsible for several GDPR violations, including violations committed by the sub-processor:

* A large number of data subjects were contacted without their consent and without receiving any information on the processing of their data, in violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 6, and 7 GDPR as well as 130 d. lgs. 196/2003;
* The controller violated Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR, by allowing access to personal data from unauthorized staff (as MG Company was not appointed as a processor or sub-processor);
* The controller failed to watch over the correct processing of personal data from its processor and sub-processor, in violation of Articles 24 and 25 GDPR;
* Finally, the controller did not appoint the sub-processor as a processor or sub-processor, in violation of Article 28 GDPR.

"In April 2020, the Polish Prime Minister decided to hold elections for the President of the Republic of Poland by postal voting. He instructed the Polish Post S.A. (Post) to prepare the organisation for the elections. The Post requested from the Minister of Digitalisation (Minister) citizens personal data collected in the Register of the Universal Electronic Population Registration System (PESEL Register) for the purpose of creating a database of voters' addresses for the delivery of packages.

The Minister provided the personal data of approximately 30 million people. More specifically; the PESEL number (a unique 11-digit identifier), the first names, the surnames, the last current address of permanent residence registration, the address of temporary residence registration, as well as the currently registered temporary departure outside the country of all living persons of legal age with a registered Polish citizenship.

The Post continued to process the data for the purposes of the organisation of the general election up until their deletion in May 2020.

In April 2020, the Ombudsman for Civil Rights Protection filed a complaint to the Provincial Administrative Court of Warsaw (WSA) against the aforementioned decision of the Polish Prime Minister and in May 2020 against the Minister's action to provide the personal data.

Following the complaints, the WSA, in 2021, and the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland (NSA), in 2024, issued their final judgments. They declared the Minister's action of April 2020 to provide the Post with access to personal data from the PESEL register ineffective. Both courts held that there was no legal basis under polish law for conducting the 2020 presidential election exclusively by correspondence and therefore no legal basis for issuing an order that would oblige one to take steps to prepare to carry them out. Also, the courts stated that the Post and the Minister were obliged to verify whether the request of the Prime Minister was justified.

In 2025, the DPA deemed it necessary to initiate proceedings ex officio.

The Minister claimed that, according to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful when it is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation incumbent on the controller, while the Post claimed that its actions were not unlawful.","The DPA examined the case taking into account that it was bound by the aforementioned judgements of the WSA and NSA and was not able to assess the actions of the Minister and the Post differently. It has no doubt that both the Minister and the Post acted as controllers of the personal data in question.

First, the DPA upheld that there was no legal provision to stipulate the processing of personal data from the PESEL register. Therefore Article 6(1)(c) GDPR could not be considered a legal basis. Furthermore, the DPA examined the possibility of another legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR and held that it is impossible to conclude that there is one. The Minister, by sharing personal data to the Post for the purpose of organising the general elections in 2020 and the Post, by carrying out tasks related to this purpose, processed personal data unlawfully. Consequently, the DPA found a violation of Article 6(1) and 5(1)(a) GDPR.

"US company Luka Inc. (the controller) made available Replika, a chatbot based on generative AI. Replika was meant to be a virtual companion that could help users track their mood, cope with stress, and work out their emotional and psychological problems. Replika could be configured to fulfil various roles, including therapist and romantic partner.

Replika gained attention from international media after it allegedly encouraged minors to engage in self-harm. The news prompted an ex officio investigation from the DPA.

In early 2023 the Italian DPA ordered the controller to halt the processing of personal data of all users in Italy, as a precautionary measure. In this early phase of the procedure, the DPA found evidence of possible GDPR violations and reserved the right to investigate further.

Months later the DPA lifted the ban on the condition that the controller took steps to ensure Replika’s compliance with data protection law, including implementing an effective age verification system to prevent minors from accessing the service. The controller made Replika available again after the ban was lifted.

In May 2025 the DPA issued a final decision and closed the procedure. The DPA reserved the right to further investigate certain aspects of the case in a different procedure.","The DPA found violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 6, 12, 13, 24, and 25(1) GDPR.

The DPA fined the controller €5,000,000. This is a notably high fine amounting to 2% of the controller’s global turnover - half the statutory maximum under the GDPR.

On the scope of the decision

In its decision, the DPA found violations of the principles of lawfulness and transparency based on the version of Replika’s privacy notice in force on February 2023 (the date of the DPA’s order to halt the processing).

The controller later made changes to its notice. The DPA reserved the right to open a second investigation on lawfulness, based on the controller’s up-to-date notice.

The DPA also found that the controller failed to implement age verification measures to prevent minors from using Replika. In this regard, the DPA assessed the measures in place both before and after the suspension order and concluded that both were insufficient.

On the competence of the DPA and the scope of the GDPR

The DPA held that the controller’s processing of personal data was within the scope of the GDPR, and that the Italian DPA was competent to enforce the GDPR with regards to the processing of personal data from users in Italy.

With regards to the applicability of the GDPR, the controller implicitly admitted that its service targeted users in the European Union (specifically, by stating that it stopped providing Replika to users in Italy, in response to the DPA’s early order to halt the processing of personal data). Therefore, the DPA held that the data processing fell within the scope of the GDPR.

With regards to the DPA’s competence, the controller claimed that it had a European establishment in the Netherlands. On this basis, the controller contested the Italian DPA’s competence and claimed that the Dutch DPA was the lead supervisory authority for the case.

However, the controller provided no evidence whatsoever of this alleged Dutch establishment. Additionally, the controller never mentioned an European establishment on Replika’s website or privacy notice.

For these reasons, the DPA rejected the controller’s arguments. The DPA held that the controller had no European establishment and that, therefore, the cooperation mechanism of the GDPR did not apply. On these grounds, the DPA considered itself competent in the case.

On lawfulness

The DPA examined the controller’s (now outdated) privacy notice. The notice did not clearly mention the legal bases for processing users’ personal data. Instead, it only contained generic and implicit hints at the legal bases.

Furthermore, the notice did not connect legal grounds to the purposes of each data processing operation. This violated the principle of granularity and made it impossible to assess whether each legal basis was invoked validly.

Finally, the privacy notice did not explicitly mention the training of the AI model as a purpose for the processing, and did not mention the legal basis for that processing of personal data for that purpose.

On these grounds, the DPA held that the processing of personal data was both unlawful and opaque, in violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 6 GDPR.

The DPA noted that the controller's new privacy notice was more precise on legal bases. The DPA reserved the right to assess the lawfulness of the processing in a new investigation.

On transparency

The DPA found other violations of the principle of transparency in addition to unclear legal bases. The privacy notice in force in 2023:

* was only available in English;
* did not distinguish between the different purposes for processing personal data (especially with regards to “chatbot interaction” and “AI training”);
* did not clarify that Replika was meant for adult users only;
* did not mention for how long personal data would be stored;
* incorrectly stated that personal data might have been transferred to the US;
* incorrectly implied that users could be subject to automated decision-making covered by Article 22 GDPR (i.e.: automated decision making which ""produces legal effects"" concerning the data subject or ""similarly significantly affects him or her"").

For these reasons, the DPA held that the controller violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, 2, and 13 GDPR.

On age verification

Throughout the procedure the controller maintained that Replika was meant for adult use only. However, the DPA The DPA noted that the controller implemented no age verification system for Replika at the time of the temporary halt to the processing.

Interestingly, the DPA also found a violation of the data minimisation principle (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR). The lack of age verification resulted in the collection and processing of personal data from minors, even though the controller did intend to provide Replika to minors. So, the processing of personal data exceeded its stated purpose (i.e.: providing Replika to adult users).

The controller later implemented age verification mechanisms for Replika. In practice, users were asked to state their age and were refused access if under 18. However, the DPA found these mechanisms lacking. In particular:

* users were able to change their birth date in their profile after sign up. This would not prompt age verification from the controller’s website;
* the controller implemented a 24 hour “cooling off” period during which users who claimed to be minors, could not connect again. This prevented them from connecting Replika again and providing a different birth date. However, users could circumvent this “cooling off” period via incognito browsing.

On these grounds, the DPA held that the controller violated Articles 24 and 25(1) GDPR, and that the violation continued until the final decision.

Interestingly, the DPA also found a violation of the data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR). The lack of age verification resulted in the collection and processing of personal data from minors, even though the controller did intend to provide Replika to minors in the first place. So, in the DPA's view, the processing of personal data exceeded its stated purpose (i.e.: providing Replika to adult users).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 5, Article 6, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25"
"In October 2022 the DPA opened an inquiry into the video surveillance measures implemented by a secondary school (the controller).

Following two on-site inspections and an exchange of information with the controller, the DPA found the following facts:

* video surveillance cameras operated 24/7 and stored footage for 57 days (the controller clarified that 57 days was the longest possible time the direction could take leave for the summer holidays);
* 6 members of the technical staff had access to real-time footage through a shared account;
* only the principal and deputy principal had access to recorded footage. Each of them accessed footage through an individual account;
* the system did not log access to either real time footage or recordings;
* three posters at the entrance of the school, informed the data subjects (i.e.: the people whose footage were capture) about the use of CCTV surveillance.

During the procedure, the controller stated that the legal basis for the processing of personal data, was its interest in preventing theft and vandalism. However, the DPA found that the controller did not assess the balancing of this interest with the rights and freedoms of the data subjects (i.e.: the people whose footage was captured).","First, the DPA held that the school was the controller for the processing of personal data via CCTV cameras. It did not matter that the school did not have legal personality under Luxembourgish law. In this regard, the DPA pointed out that the school could determine the purposes and means of the processing, and could freely choose its processor for installing and operating the CCTV system.

Second, the DPA observed that the controller relied on the legal basis of legitimate interest, without balancing its interest against the data subject’s. For this reason, the controller violated its accountability obligations.

Third, the DPA held that the controller violated its transparency obligation. The information posters at the entrance of the school, did not provide sufficient information about the processing of personal data. Furthermore, the controller failed to prove that it provided information orally, as it claimed during the exchange with the DPA.

Additionally, the DPA held that the controller violated the principles of data minimisation and storage limitation in several ways:

* The field of view of the cameras inside the building, was too broad. The DPA held that the cameras should have only covered people entering or waiting to enter;
* The cameras covered areas dedicated to free time and sports. The DPA held that this was excessive, and that cameras covering those areas should have been active only outside of school hours;
* The DPA held that 57 days was an excessive storage period for the footage and suggested 30 days instead.

Finally, the DPA held that the controller violated the principle of security by failing to log access to the system and by allowing technical staff to access the system via a shared account.

On these bases, the DPA held that the data controller violated Articles 51(1)(a),5(1)(c), 5(1)(e), 5(2), 13(1), 13(2), 32(1) GDPR.

The DPA ordered the controller to bring its use of CCTV into compliance within three months. In particular, the DPA prescribed the following steps:

* providing all the necessary information to data subjects (either via a single document, or through a layered privacy notice)
* limiting the field of vision of the cameras to what was strictly necessary, to prevent theft and vandalism
* limiting the retention time for CCTV footage to 30 days;
* setting up individual accounts for the technical staff;
* setting up an access and event logging system for the CCTV system, and periodically examining the system logs to detect anomalies.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 6, Article 13, Article 25, Article 32"
"Two data subjects filed a complaint against a controller (Data Diggers Market Research SRL). This case concerned cross border processing, as the data subjects lived in different Member States than the controller. The Romanian DPA was the lead supervisory authority in accordance with Articles 56 and 61 GDPR because the headquarters of the controller is located in Romania.","The Romanian DPA fined the controller RON 59,726 (€12,000) in total. RON 24,886 (€5,000) for the violation of Article 6(1) GDPR, meaning the controller processed the data unlawfully. RON 9,954 (€2,000) for the violation of Article 14(1) and (2) GDPR. The controller had the obligation to communicate information on the processing (e.g. the identity of the controller, or the purpose(s) of processing) when first communicating with the data subjects. Finally, RON 24,886 (€5,000) for the violation of Article 15, meaning the controller had not given the data subjects the complete information they had requested when exercising their right of access. Both Articles 14 and 15 GDPR were analysed in relation to Article 12 GDPR, as it restates the obligation to provide the information in relation to the articles on data subject rights.

"ATRESMEDIA (the controller) is a large Spanish media company. The controller published a video online in one of their news broadcasts showing several young people. The faces were blurred, however the voices of at least three people (including the victim and aggressor, who were minors) were not altered. The Spanish DPA requested the controller to remove the video or distort the voices to make them unidentifiable. The controller later removed the video and kept the original as evidence.","The definition and interpretation of personal data (Article 4(1) GDPR) and processing (Article 4(2) GDPR) is broad, and the DPA stated that the publication of a video with someone’s voice is processing of personal data. A person’s voice is unique and can reveal aspects of a person, including age and culture. A voice can also be used to identify someone, whether this is directly or indirectly. The DPA highlighted the technological advancements in AI that can easily identify someone, and the risks that can pose for a data subject’s fundamental rights.

The DPA then analysed whether the controller processed data according to the principle of data minimisation. According to Article 5(1)(c), the controller must consider the necessity and proportionality of the processing, including the risks and fundamental rights involved. The DPA also relied on Article 39 GDPR and Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case law, stating that the processing should be done through less intrusive means. The DPA concluded that the controller could have taken additional measures to process the data in a less intrusive means, and that the current technologies allow the controller to upload videos with distorted voices.

It is important to note that fundamental rights are not absolute. Here, the DPA considered the balance between the right to data protection and the right to freedom of expression and press. This means analysing whether the processing of personal data (voices) is necessary for the controller’s purpose (the publication of news). The DPA referred to case law from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to argue that the freedom of expression of the controller should be interpreted narrowly- this is because including the voices is not necessary to understand the facts of the news, and the mere wish to satisfy the public’s curiosity is not enough to justify the processing.

The DPA also highlighted the interpretation of the fundamental right to data protection in Spanish constitutional case law,  which empowers the data subject to decide what data is given to third parties, and what is done with said data. Explicit consent (unless exceptional circumstances apply) and being informed, according to the Spanish Supreme Court, are indispensable aspects of this fundamental right. These rights are further enhanced in the case of minors, whose right to privacy may be prioritised even in cases of public interest.

The DPA fined the controller €50,000. This included aggravating factors such as several data subjects being minors, the negligence of the controller, and the potentially unlimited audience of the video online. Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine and waive their right to appeal. This action reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The fine can be reduced by a further 20% if the controller acknowledges its liability. The controller opted for both and reduced the fine by 40%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €30,000.

The controller paid the fine on 10 April 2025. Finally, the DPA included corrective measures as well, requiring the controller to adopt necessary measures to avoid publishing personal data beyond what is necessary.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 5
"Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co. (DeepSeek) is a company established in China that provides an LLM platform called ‘DeepSeek AI’, to data subjects located in Europe.

The Hellenic DPA initiated ex officio investigations against DeepSeek for the services provided in the EU and particularly in Greece.

The DPA addressed a letter to DeepSeek reminding them that they fall within the scope of the GDPR according to Article 3(3) GDPR and have an obligation to a appoint a representative in the EU in writing pursuant to Article 27 GDPR. The DPA also addressed them a number of questions in order to determine their compliance with the GDPR, regarding the lawfulness of processing, the processing activities and the legal basis for each processing activity of personal data of data subjects located in Greece, their obligation to ensure that data subjects can exercise their rights and the location of the data centres used for hosting and providing the DeepSeek software.

DeepSeek denied offering services in the EU and therefore falling within the scope of the GDPR, but stated that they are willing to accept the DPA's advice and guidance on this obligation. DeepSeek answered the questions vaguely without mentioning all relevant provisions of the GDPR and stated that they store data in China, without mentioning the establishment of additional legal safeguards.

Furthermore, DeepSeek’s privacy policy does not make any reference to the GDPR and uses unclear wording.

After examining all relevant information, the DPA issued a decision.","First, the DPA held that the services offered by DeepSeek are undoubtedly addressed and targeted to EU data subjects and therefore DeepSeek falls within the scope Article 3(3) GDPR. DeepSeek, acting as a controller, makes clear its intention to offer services to data subjects located in the EU and in particular to Greece, as it is accessible both via the internet and through mobile applications to data subjects located in Greece and the applications are also available in Greek.

In this case, according to Article 27 GDPR, DeepSeek was required to appoint in writing a representative in the EU, who must be established in one of the Member States where the data subjects whose data are processed in connection with an offer of goods or services to them or whose behaviour is monitored are located.

Second, the DPA points that in the case of a controller without an establishment in the EU, which falls within the scope of the GDPR on the basis of the targeting criterion set out in Article 3(3) GDPR, each national supervisory authority is competent to monitor his compliance with the GDPR in the territory of its Member State.

In the light of the above, the DPA found an infringement and ordered DeepSeek to appoint a representative in the EU in writing, as required by Article 27 GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 3, Article 27"

This increased the risk of access to the personal data of its customers. The DPA then fined the controller for not implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures in line with the risk of processing, as stated in Article 32(1)(b) and 32(2) GDPR.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"CALOGA (the controller) is a company that carries out commercial marketing operations, as well as acting as a data broker. The controller organizes its processing in four databases. One of the services the controller offered was to carry out e-mail marketing campaigns on behalf of companies. To do this, the controller used data collected by data brokers through entry forms for game contests or online product tests. These forms were misleading because the buttons to accept the use of data subjects’ data was much more prominent than those to reject it (this is also known as dark patterns). The controller relied on prior consent given for the initial collectors, and did not allow the data subject to withdraw consent as easily as they had given it.

The DPA carried out an on-the-spot investigation of the company in 2022. On June 2024, the DPA rapporteur informed the controller of its breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 6(1)(a) and 32 GDPR. The controller responded with two arguments- first, it could not foresee that the DPA’s conclusions, as there were no specific recommendations on direct marketing at the time of the inspection. The controller also argued that it had no role in obtaining consent when the data was first collected, and that the contractual and verification measures for the data collected were sufficient.","The DPA considered that CALOGA acted as a joint controller for the purposes of transmitting the data to partners (these partners were considered joint controllers).

The DPA first dismissed the controller’s foreseeability argument, stating there were rules applicable to direct marketing and consent for several years, and the recommendations on consent through cookies can serve as a guideline for general collection of consent. The DPA also considered the contractual and verifications measures taken by the controller as insufficient. According to Article 7 GDPR, the controller must prove that the data subject has consented to the data processing concerning them. If the controller processes data without collecting the data directly, it also must review the way in which its partners collect consent.

The DPA found the controller’s reliance on prior consent unlawful; consent can only be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous (Article 4(11) GDPR) if the data subject gives express consent after being given adequate information on what the data will be used for. This is supported by CJEU case law such as Planet49, in which the CJEU states that the user’s expression of wishes must relate precisely with the processing and cannot be inferred. Furthermore, any inappropriate influence preventing the data subject from exercising their will renders the consent invalid; this applies to the use of dark patterns, and therefore the controller could not rely on consent as a legal basis (Article 6(1)(a)), given that the conditions for consent were not met.

The DPA considered the process of withdrawing consent problematic. National law transposing the ePrivacy Directive (Code des postes et des communications électroniques, Postal and Electronic Communications Code) allows the data subject to withdraw consent to direct marketing. In addition, Article 7(3) GDPR states that withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it. Following this logic, the data subject should be able to withdraw consent from all databases and advertisers through one link, similarly to how they consented to it. However, unsubscribing through an e-mail link merely withdraws the consent for a specific advertiser or database.

The controller did not respect the principle of storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e) GDPR). The controller applied a twelve month retention period from the last action taken by the data subject. This also included opening direct advertising emails. Following this period, the data was still stored for four years in an active database. The DPA considered this excessive.

Finally, the DPA did not find a violation of Article 32 GDPR, as there were sufficient data security measures in place.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 7, Article 32"
"Carrefour S.A. (the controller) reported five data breaches to the DPA between January and September 2023. According to the controller, all breaches were likely related to the unlawful access to client’s accounts using Credential Stuffing, however it was unable to identify the original source of the stolen credentials. The controller was aware of the first breach in October 2022, but did not report it until January 2023.

According to the DPA, the breaches affected a high number of data subject's accounts (almost 119,000 in total). This was disputed by the controller, who argued that a much lower number of accounts (974) was affected. The data breach revealed personal data related to their clients; at the very least, the attacker was able to confirm that the credentials were correct, and there was a high risk that they also had access to personal information in the accounts (such as their full name, contact information and address).

The controller claimed to have communicated with its clients following the third breach, however, the e-mail only informed the client of a change in their password, and did not specify that there was a data breach. The controller merely stated that it had reset the passwords to improve their services, and how the data subject could set a new password.

The DPA began investigating in May 2023.","The DPA stated that the controller had not adhered to its security obligations under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. The controller infringed on Article 24(1) GDPR and 32 GDPR by not having appropriate security measures in place. This is a proactive obligation that requires the controller to go beyond reacting to data breaches and implement preventative measures if necessary; the DPA criticised the controller for its delay in implementing measures. For example, the controller did not introduce two factor authentication until the fifth breach.

The DPA considered two aspects as aggravating factors:

First, that the data breaches posed a serious security risk for the data subjects. The data that accessed allowed third parties to construct a detailed profile of the data subject, which increased the probability of identity theft and fraud.

Second, that the controller processed very large amounts of data on a daily basis. The controller also operates in a sector where trust and information security are essential. According to the DPA, the controller has the responsibility to more rigorously guarantee the protection of personal data principles based on these two factors. Reports from the regular audits the controller carried out showed clear security risks and recommended specific measures. The controller was aware of the security and confidentiality risks but chose not to implement measures in response to them.

In addition, the controller did not give the data subjects sufficient information about the data breach; the email did not specify that there was a data breach, or mention its severity, the implications on their data or the measures taken in response. This left the data subjects unaware of the risks, and was a violation of Article 34 GDPR. The DPA took into account the communication following the fourth and fifth data breach. At the time of the decision, the statute of limitations for the first three breaches had passed in accordance with national law.

Finally, the DPA dismissed the arguments of the controller to reduce the fine. The controller claimed that only 974 accounts were affected during the data breaches, and that it had fully collaborated with the DPA. Both arguments were dismissed, as the DPA’s findings revealed a much higher number of accounts affected, and the fact that reporting is a legal obligation under Article 33 GDPR.

The DPA fined the controller €3,200,000 in total. €2,000,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, €1,000,000 for the violation of Article 32 GDPR and €200,000 for the violation of Article 34 GDPR.

A whistleblower notified the DPA that the controller transmits pharmaceutical data from its online pharmacy, such as browsing data or data indicating the intention to purchase a particular medicine, to Meta, Google and New Relic (a performance monitoring service). These companies received precise information about medicine purchases, data that could be linked to an individual customer.

In June 2022 the DPA initiated investigation on the matter.

The controller claimed that no information about the medicines purchased by the customers or the names of the medicines have been transmitted to Meta, Google or New Relic and that is not possible to draw any conclusions from the pages viewed as to what products the customer has purchased, let alone any further conclusions about the health or medical condition of the person. The controller has further argued that any data transmitted have been limited and masked and in any case browsing data are not personal data under the GDPR.","First, the DPA held that the controller failed to ensure that external tracking service providers (Google, Meta) did not have access to personal data relating to online pharmacy transactions in a way that was contrary to the requirements of integrity, confidentiality and security of processing therefore violating Article 5(1)(f), Article 32(1) and Article 32(2) GDPR.

The DPA found that the website’s service providers received information about website visitors, such as IP addresses and other data that can be used to identify the data subject. The combination of these data with data across different website visits can allow for large- scale, automated identification and profiling of the data subjects. As a result, the DPA held that the data on browsing, purchase intention and purchase of medicines transmitted by the controller to the monitoring service provider are therefore, in relation to the service provider, personal data of an identifiable person within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

To do this, the controller purchases data subjects’ data from data brokers, who collect this data through websites’ entry forms for game contests or online product testing. According to the DPA’s findings, the forms are misleading as they make it significantly easier to consent to having their data being used for direct marketing than not.

The DPA carried out on site investigation in 2022, and informed the controller of its findings in July 2024. The controller argued that it should not be held liable for the way in which its partners collect consent, and that its contractual measures were sufficient to fulfill its obligations. The controller also argued that it could have not foreseen the DPA’s investigation because at the time of the investigation the DPA had not published recommendations specific to consent in the direct marketing sector.","The DPA considered that SOLOCAL acted as a controller in carrying out direct marketing on behalf of its customers and in transferring the data for companies to carry out the direct marketing themselves. The DPA considered SOLOCAL potentially as a joint controller with its partners.

First, the way in which consent was collected in the online forms did not comply with consent requirements under the GDPR or national law (Postal and Electronic Communications Code or CPCE). The DPA found that the design of the forms did not allow the user to give free and unambiguous consent. The forms gave a significant prominence to the buttons allowing processing for direct marketing purposes compared to the option of not consenting to direct marketing. According to the DPA, the user’s expression of wishes must relate precisely with the processing and cannot be inferred. This was supported by CJEU case law such as Planet49. Any inappropriate influence preventing the data subject from exercising their will render the consent invalid. Therefore the controller could not rely on consent as a legal basis (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR), given that the conditions for consent under Article 4(11) GDPR or Article 7 GDPR were not met.

The DPA also dismissed the controller’s argument on foreseeability. The DPA stated that rules relating to direct marketing and consent were available years before the investigation took place. This was especially the case considering the case law, guidelines and legal provisions it had cited to support its arguments on consent above.

The DPA did not consider the controller’s contractual measures as sufficient. The contractual framework was broad and placed a significant responsibility on the collectors of the data. The controller had the proactive obligation to carry out regular checks and to implement necessary consequences for the lack of validity. Furthermore, the controller had also failed to demonstrate that the data subject gave consent to process their data for direct marketing purposes under Article 7(1) GDPR and Article L. 34(5) CPCE. This was especially serious for one of the data brokers, because the controller was unable to receive information despite several requests.

Finally, the DPA considered the legal basis to transfer the data unlawful. Under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may prevail over those of the controller taking into account the reasonable expectations of the data subject. Here, the DPA stated that the controller could not rely on legitimate interests in this case, considering the fact that the data subjects were not informed and therefore could not have reasonably expected such processing.

The data were subject to strict access controls and were analyzed solely for cybersecurity purposes.

At the time of the investigation, navigation logs and email metadata were stored without the involvement of trade unions or the Inspectorate. However, consultations with trade unions were ongoing and an agreement was eventually reached and formalized.

The DPA also investigated the controller’s use of a ticketing system provided by a processor. The DPA found that open tickets were stored indefinitely by the system. The controller later dismissed the system, stopped engaging with the processor, and prompted the processor to erase all data relative to the provision of services to the controller.","On lawfulness

The DPD held that the collection and retention of browsing logs and email metadata constituted systems for the remote surveillance of employees in the specific meaning of Italian labor law.

The DPA observed that the controller did not fulfill the requirements for implementing such a system under labor law. Contrary to the controller's arguments, the DPA also held that the processing of employee data did not fall under any exemption under Italian labor law.

For these reasons, the DPA considered that the collection and retention of browsing logs and email metadata violated labor law. The DPA concluded that such data processing operations also lacked a legal ground under the GPDR, in violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 6, and 88 GDPR.

Other findings

Additionally, the DPA held that the controller:

* Stored navigation logs for an excessive time, in violations of Articles 5(1)(c), 5(1)(e), and 25 GDPR;
* Collected irrelevant information about the personal lives of employees, in violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR;
* Failed to carry out a data processing impact assessment for the storage of navigation data and email metadata, in violation of Article 35 GDPR;
* Violated Articles 5(1)(c), 25, and 28 GDPR by allowing the providers of its ticketing system to store open tickets (including employees’ names) for an excessive time, and by failing to stipulate data processing agreements.

Conclusions

Overall, the DPA found that the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a), (c) and (c), 6, 25, 28, 35, and 88 GDPR as well as Articles 113 and 114 of the Italian privacy code.

The DPA fined the controller for €50,000 and ordered the controller to address its violations. Specifically, the DPA ordered the controller: •

* To anonymize data about the access to blacklisted websites;
* To limit the retention of navigation logs to 90 days. More exactly, the controller had to either anonymize or delete the logs after 90 days;
* To pseudonymize navigation logs by encrypting the name of the user of each company computer;
* To require the providers of the ticketing systems to pseudonymize the data of the filing employee;
* To limit access to the data to a small number of staff members tasked with incident response, and to provide such staff members with data protection training.

In determining the fine, the DPA considered that the controller had already remedied some of its violations.

"The data subject was a customer of a group of daycare centers in Belgium (the Company). The Company entered into an agreement with a debt collection agency (the Agency) to recover outstanding debts. The Company and the Agency are controllers of personal data.

In 2016, the Company sent to the data subject an invoice that remained unpaid, and then transferred it to the Agency.

In February 2017, the Agency addressed the data subject to demand the payment of the outstanding invoice. The data subject responded that the Company’s claim was unfounded and therefore the Agency had no legal basis to further process his data.

In June 2018, the Company acknowledged that an invoicing error is at the origin of the claim, waived the outstanding amount and informed the Agency accordingly. The data subject requested the erasure of his personal data. Then, the Agency informed the data subject that it had removed all of their data from its database.

Nevertheless, the Agency pseudonymised the personal data rather than erasing them.

In September 2018, the Agency sent 2 new payment requests to the data subject for the payment of the outstanding invoice.  According to the Agency, the requests  were sent accidentally because of a technical and a human error in the deletion process.

In October 2018, the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA (Autorité de protection des données-APD/Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit-GBA).

First, the DPA noted that the Company’s privacy notice did not provide information about the processing activity in the context of the collection of unpaid invoices and that information on dept collection agencies was missing from the categories of recipients. The DPA held that it could not be assumed that data subjects already had the information in question. Based on the foregoing, the DPA found that the Company violated Article 12(1) and Article 13 GDPR.

Second, the DPA found that the Company did not include information about the processing of personal data in the context of the collection of unpaid invoices in its register of processing activities, in violation of Article 30(1) GDPR. The DPA rejected their claim that they used a model registry from a third party that they assumed met all legal requirements.

"Following media reports about online tracking, the DPA started several ex officio investigations over the use of tracking tools on websites. Among others, the DPA investigated www.nhi.no, a website providing information about medical topics. The website included many subpages providing information on specific health conditions. The website was published by the company Norsk Helseinformatikk AS (the controller).

The investigation found that the website presented visitors with a cookie banner provided by the cookie management platform Cookiebot. The banner offered visitors three options: “Only necessary cookies”, “Customize”, and “Allow all cookies”. The “Only necessary cookies” button was somewhat visible but featured less prominent colors than the others.

The investigation found that the website implemented the Meta pixel. The Meta pixel is not a cookie and is not stored client-side. The pixel tracked information about actions taken by the user on the website and shared it with Meta. In addition, the pixel stored a tracking cookie (-fbp) on the users’ browser.

The website implemented the pixel on both the home page and subpages, which made it possible to track an individual user’s journey through the website. The website forwarded other information to Meta, including IP addresses, fingerprints for the user’s device, and the unique identifier from the _fbp cookie.

The investigation found that the controller implemented other trackers. However, the DPA decided to limit the scope of the proceedings to the use of the Meta pixel.","The DPA held that the controller unlawfully processed sensitive data via the Meta pixel, in violation of Articles 6 and 9 GDPR.

The DPA held that Norsk Helseinformatikk was only a controller for the initial data processing via the pixel. So, the DPA did not examine the subsequent processing of these data after their disclosure to Meta.

The DPA issued a warning against the controller. The DPA clarified that an injunction to remove the pixel was not needed, as the controller already did so during the procedure. The DPA did, however, order the controller to collect explicit consent to the processing of sensitive data, should it implement the pixel again in the future.

The Meta pixel processed personal data

The DPA held that the data forwarded by the Meta pixel could identify a data subject when combined with the other information forwarded to Meta by the website. For this reason, the DPA held that the controller processed personal data via the pixel. The controller did not challenge the conclusion.

The Meta pixel processed sensitive data

The Meta pixel tracked visits to individual subpages. The DPA observed that this made it possible to infer information about the health status of individual users: if a user visited pages about a specific health condition, it was likely that they suffered from it. On this basis, the DPA preliminarily held that the pixel processed sensitive data.

During the procedure the controller challenged this conclusion based on a restrictive reading of CJEU case law on sensitive data. The DPA rejected NHI’s arguments and stated that CJEU case law set a low threshold for what is to be considered sensitive data.

In particular, the DPA clarified that for data to be sensitive according to CJEU case law, there was no requirement:

* for information to be directly linked to a person’s health condition;
* for information to allow for accurate inferences (because inaccurate personal data are nonetheless protected by the GDPR);
* for information to be linked with additional information, in order to infer sensitive data more reliably (which Meta could do but NHI could not).

For these reasons, the DPA confirmed that the controller processed personal and sensitive data by implementing the Meta pixel on its website.

Explicit consent was required

The DPA clarified that the Meta pixel processed personal data exclusively for advertising purposes. The DPA also stated that the data subject’s consent was the only legal basis for processing sensitive data for advertising purposes. In this regard, the DPA clarified that legitimate interest would generally not be a valid legal ground, as data subjects’ rights to the protection of their sensitive data will typically outweigh a data controller’s interest in advertising.

For these reasons, the DPA examined whether the controller collected valid consent from visitors in light of the requirements of the GDPR. In this regard, the DPA decided to limit its investigation to two specific requirements for valid consent under Article 4(11): “freely given” and “informed”. The DPA found that neither requirement was fulfilled and held that sensitive data were processed without consent.

Consent was not freely given

The DPA observed that the less prominent color of the “Only necessary cookies” button on the cookie banner, amounted to a dark pattern and nudged users towards accepting non-necessary cookies and trackers from the website. For this reason, the DPA held that the users’ consent was not freely given.

Contrary to the controller’s arguments, it did not matter that all the buttons were clearly visible. In the DPA’s view, the more prominent color scheme of the “Accept all cookies” option was sufficient to nudge users towards accepting unnecessary trackers. In this regard, the DPA pointed out that there was no real reason to implement different levels of color contrast for different buttons, aside from manipulating user behavior.

Consent was not informed

The DPA considered that the website’s privacy policy explicitly stated that the website would not process sensitive data. The DPA pointed out that the statement was erroneous and, therefore, did not inform users that their sensitive data would be processed. For this reason, the DPA held that users’ consent was uninformed.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 9"
"In 2022 the DPA planned several ex officio investigations on the compliance of cookies and cookie banners, with a focus on e-commerce websites, vehicle retailers, tourism agencies, and transportation companies.

In 2023, the DPA started one of its planned investigations, focusing on an unnamed business (the controller).

The DPA found that the website’s cookie banner presented users with the “accept all cookies”, “only accept necessary”, and “settings” options, along with an “X” button that closed the banner. Additionally, the banner only provided very generic information on the use of non-essential cookies. Furthermore, the footer of the website included non-functioning links to the website’s cookie policy.","The DPA held that the lack of information about cookie use, rendered the user’s consent invalid. For this reason, the DPA reprimanded the controller for violating Articles 4(11), 5, 7, 12, 13, 24 and 25 GDPR as well as Article 122 of the Italian data protection code.

The DPA did not issue a fine. In this regard, the DPA considered that the controller changed the design of the cookie banner and provided more information to visitors during the procedure.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13, Article 24, Article 25"

"Following media reports about the use of invasive tracking tools on website, DPA investigated www.116111.no. The website is a help line for abused minors operated by the Kristiansand Municipality (the controller).

The investigation found 17 cookies on the website along with Meta and Snap pixels. A pixel is a tracking tool attached to the website that directly sends user’s data to its operator. The DPA decided to limit its investigation to the use of the pixels.

At the time of the investigation, the controller’s privacy policy did not mention the cookies and the pixels. The privacy policy was later amended to list cookies and tracking pixels more completely. However, the new privacy policy still failed to specify the legal basis for processing personal data, and the categories of data processed via the trackers.","The DPA fined the controller 250,000 NOK (€21,600) for processing personal data via the Snap and Meta pixels without a lawful basis. The DPA clarified that it did not issue an injunction to remove the trackers because the controller already did so at the time of the decision.

The municipality was the data controller

The DPA fist established that the municipality was a data controller for the pixels as per Article 4(7) GDPR as it operated the website, integrated the tracking tools and determined the purpose of processing (i.e.: to measure the reach of its media campaign).

In this regard, the DPA clarified that it was not relevant that the municipality had no access to the data processed via the pixels. On this point, the DPA referred to the Fashion ID ruling of the CJEU.

Processing without a lawful basis

Third party pixel collected personal information including unique user IDs, IP addresses, and device fingerprints which could be used as identifiers by Meta and Snap. For this reasons, the DPA held the pixels collected personal data, contrary to what the controller’s privacy policy stated.

The DPA then assess whether the controller could rely on a legal basis for processing personal data. Specifically, the DPA held that:

* The controller could not rely on consent, because its website did not collect consent;
* Commercial tracking is not a public interest covered by Article 6(1)(e) GDPR;
* Legitimate interest was not a valid legal basis, because the stated objective of examining the marketing campaign did not outweigh the rights and freedoms of children.

With regards to legitimate interest, the DPA further stated that in the case at hand, the controller processed information of a ""very private nature"" which was close to constituting sensitive data under the GDPR. Sharing these data with third parties had significant privacy implications and could lead to a loss of control over personal data. These considerations were crucial to the DPA’s conclusion that the controller did not correctly balance its interest with those of the data subject.

The privacy policy

The controller’s privacy policy did not inform data subjects that the pixels processed their data. In fact, the policy stated that the website only processed anonymous data. For this reason, the DPA held that the controller failed to provide information about the processing of personal data, in breach of Articles 12(1) and 13 GDPR. The controller also noted that the information provided in the policy was not understandable for children.

The amount of the fine

The DPA issued a fine 250,000 NOK (€21,600). The DPA considered that the controller acted negligently and shared personal data of children, even though it did not intend to do so. On the other hand, the DPA also considered that the controller cooperated during the procedure and eventually removed the pixels before the decision.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 6, Article 12, Article 13"

To view and download the results of their DNA analysis (raw genetic data) customers must create an account.

Between 25 May 2018 and 31 December 2024, a threat actor was able to perpetrate a credential stuffing attack and obtain access to personal data relating to 155,592 UK-based customers of 23andMe.  Some of the data constituted special category personal data relating to health and genetic data, as well as data relating to the racial or ethnic origin.

In August and October 2023, the personal data exfiltrated by the threat actor was offered for sale on a number of online forums.

23andMe became aware of the data breach in October 2023 and notified the DPA (Information Commissioner's Office-ICO).

In June 2024, the DPA informed 23andMe of the launch of investigation into the data breach.","First, the DPA found that 23andMe infringed Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR, by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of its processing systems and services including by failing to implement:

i.	appropriate authentication and verification measures as part of its customer login process, including, but not limited to, multi-factor authentication, secure password requirements, unpredictable usernames, or other measures recognised as effective defences against credential stuffing attacks;

ii.	 additional appropriate security measures specifically focused on the access to and download of raw genetic data, despite the fact that genetic data is special category data by virtue of Article 9(1) UK GDPR and therefore merits specific protection.

iii. measures which enabled 23andMe to monitor for, detect and appropriately respond to threats to its customers’ personal data.

In early 2025, the controller submitted two personal data breach notifications under Article 33 GDPR to the Romanian National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing (ANSPDCP). The DPA also received additional complaints from individuals regarding the controller’s data processing practices.

The first incident concerned the controller’s mobile application, aur.mobi. A misconfiguration allowed unauthorised third-party access to the app’s source code. As a result, personal data of users (including name, phone number, email address, home address, national ID number, date of birth, nationality, citizenship, sex, religion, profession, education history, political experience, and spoken languages) were accessible without authentication.

In parallel, the DPA investigated the controller’s operation of two campaign websites, semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org, used to collect personal data for political outreach and statistical analysis.

Specifically, they were provided with one of two privacy notices, depending on whether they were cancer patients or healthy donors from the control group.","The DPA held that the controller’s data retention policies were excessive and not in line with the purpose of the processing. The DPA also held that the privacy notices provided to data subjects, were lacking in certain aspects.

The DPA fined the controller €21,000 for violating Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(e), 5(2), and 13 GDPR. The DPA also ordered the controller to bring the processing into compliance by clarifying its privacy notice and by changing its storage limitation policies.

On storage limitation

The investigation found that the data controller planned of storing personal data for an indeterminate amount of time up to a maximum of 25 years. The controller stated that the purpose of the storage was to enable the distribution, support, and phasing-out out CellFind in the event that the controller decided to make it available on the market. The controller stated that the storage period could not be defined a priori and needed to be evaluated at a later stage, depending–in particular–on whether the controller decided to make CellFind available on the market.

The DPA, however, considered that the storage of personal data was not necessary to support the tool’s life cycle. In this regard, the DPA pointed out that CellFind’s algorithm was locked and could not be further trained after the tool’s deployment (as the controller itself stated). Therefore, the DPA concluded that the data were not necessary to support the entire (envisaged) life cycle of CellFind.

On this ground, the DPA concluded that controller violated the principle of data minimization. The DPA ordered the controller to re-evaluate its storage policy and to communicate its new, envisage policy to the DPA.

On transparency

On the purposes of the processing

The privacy notices provided to the data subjects mentioned two distinct goals for the processing: the development of new products and the development of new algorithms. However, during the investigation the controller stated that the two purposes were inseparable and effectively formed a single purpose. For this reason, the DPA held that the privacy notice could mislead data subjects by convincing them that the processing pursued two purposes rather than one.

On these grounds, the DPA held that the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a) and 13 GDPR by providing data subjects with unclear information.

On the specificity of the purposes

The DPA found that the two purposes listed in the privacy notice for cancer patients failed to mention the specific type of cancer for which algorithms and products would be developed. Rather, the policies generically referred to “cancer” or “your disease”. In its preliminary findings, the DPA held that this information was too generic.

In its defence, the controller pointed out that the data subjects were already diagnosed with a specific type of cancer and were undergoing treatment for it. Therefore, it was clear from context what specific disease the privacy notice referred to.

The DPA accepted the controller's argument and decided that the description of the purposes of the processing did not violate the principle of transparency (although other information in the notice did, as mentioned above).",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 5, Article 13"
"In 2023 the DPA started a number of ex officio investigations on the use of cookies and other trackers on the websites of a number of businesses. One of these businesses was car retailer Confalonieri S.r.l. (the data controller).

The DPA found that the controller’s website displayed a cookie banner with three buttons: “Accept all”, “Learn more”, and an “X” button that would close the banner. The website included links to a cookie policy, a privacy notice, and a page with cookie settings.

The investigation highlighted the following issues:

* If visitors clicked the “X” button, the banner was displayed again upon subsequent visits to the website;
* The website did not store unnecessary cookies when visitors clicked the “X” button. However, the cookie banner did not inform users that they could refuse cookies this way;
* The cookie policy did not list the recipients of personal data;
* The cookie policy and the privacy notice both contained outdated legal references.

The controller changed its website during the investigation. After the update, the website displayed a small footer that succinctly informed visitors that they “declared that they read the privacy policy (…) and consent to the processing of their personal data for the required service”. The only available buttons were “Accept” and “Privacy notice”. The cookie policy was no longer available on the website and the privacy notice contained no mention of cookies and other trackers.","The DPA found the following violations:

* The controller violated Articles 12 and 13 GDPR by providing insufficient information about the processing of personal data;
* The controller nudged visitors towards giving (invalid) consent by repeatedly displaying the cookie banner after they clicked the “X” button. This practice violated Articles 4(11), 5, and 7 GDPR as well as Art. 122 d. lgs. 196/2003:
* The controller violated Articles 24 and 25 GDPR by failing to inform users that they could reject cookies via the “X” button.

The DPA issued a warning and ordered the controller to bring its practices into compliance.",NONCOMPLIANT,"Article 4, Article 5, Article 7, Article 12, Article 13"
"An information and communication company (the controller) reported a data breach to the DPA, who began an investigation.  The data breach resulted from a hacking attack, in which a third party was able to access and move the entire information system. This gave them access to personal data of data subjects in the controller’s servers.

The controller took measures immediately after learning of the data breach, including initiating steps to recover the IT system.","The DPA found a violation of Article 32(1) GDPR. During its investigations the DPA found that the controller had multiple flaws in the design of the processing system. Overall, the controller had not implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing.

The DPA fined the controller €50,000",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"The Hospital Board of the Region of Uppsala (the controller) is responsible for providing health care at the Uppsala University Hospital and the Enköping Hospital.

On 29 November 2022 the DPA received a report about a data breach regarding the controller’s processing of patients’ data. According to the report, personal data of patients (including their personal identity numbers and health data) were processed via insecure emails. The DPA started an ex officio investigation.

The investigation found that the controller implemented an email encryption tool (on top of standard, in-transit encryption) in order to secure internal emails. The controller required all its staff to use the tool to encrypt any sensitive data sent via internal emails. However, the staff did not always follow this policy: at least 15 emails were sent unencrypted between 2010 and 2022. The DPA noted that this practice potentially exposed personal data in certain situations: for instance, if a staff member accidentally forwarded an email to an unintended recipient, the recipients would be able to read it. The risk of unintended disclosure was especially high because the controller did not monitor traffic to and from the email accounts of its staff.

Additionally, DPA found that the controller used automated messaging system relating to identify number merging. These messages were unencrypted and contained personal data of patients.","The DPA held that the controller failed to implement proper security measures, in violation of Article 32(1) GDPR.

The DPA issues a warning against the controller but considered a fine to be unnecessary. In this regard, the DPA considered that the controller already took steps to address its lacking security before the decision. In particular, the controller:

* carried out a risk and vulnerability analysis;
* deleted the emails containing unencrypted sensitive data;
* better instructed the staff about its data policy;
* changed its automated messaging system;
* implemented a system to warn staff members that they were about to send emails containing personal identity numbers, in order to prevent accidental disclosures.",NONCOMPLIANT,Article 32
"Agricola International SA (the controller) is company that sells poultry and other foods. The controller reported a data breach to the DPA, who carried out an investigation. A cyberattack affected a significant number of employees, as well as their family members and customers. This included access to identity documents of employees and their spouses, information on the employee’s position (e.g. their department or employee status), as well as the employees' parents’ date of birth.","The DPA found a violation of Article 32(1)(b), (d) and (2) GDPR. The controller did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure secure processing. Specifically, the DPA found that the controller had not implemented security measures related to secure access to the network storage equipment. This increased the risk of unauthorised access to the data subjects’ personal data.

The DPA fined the controller RON 25,226.50 (€5,000).

"In April 2021, Birthlink, a Scottish charity that maintains Adoption Contact Register for Scotland, destroyed manual adoption records containing sensitive personal data of about 4,800 individuals without authorisation, breaching Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 5(2) UK GDPR.

The organisation also lacked required data protection policies and staff training, contravening Article 32(1) UK GDPR, Article 32(2) UK GDPR. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) was only notified in September 2023, two years late, in violation of Article 33 UK GDPR.","The ICO found that Birthlink violated Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR by failing to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of destroyed records and Article 5(2) by failing to demonstrate accountability. Article 32(1) UK GDPR and Article 32(2) UK GDPR were breached as Birthlink lacked appropriate security measures, policies, and staff training.

Additionally, Birthlink breached Article 33 UK GDPR by failing to notify the ICO within 72 hours of the personal data breach. Given the destruction of irreplaceable sensitive data, these infringements were deemed serious and posed a high risk to affected individuals' rights.
